        "Absrtact": "Global syntheses of palaeoenvironmental data are required to test climate models under conditions different from the present. Data sets for this purpose contain data from spatially extensive networks of sites. The data are either directly comparable to model output or readily interpretable in terms of modelled climate variables. Data sets must contain sufficient documentation to distinguish between raw (primary) and interpreted (secondary, tertiary) data, to evaluate the assumptions involved in interpretation of the data, to exercise quality control, and to select data appropriate for specific goals. Four data bases for the Late Quaternary, documenting changes in lake levels since 30 14C kyr BP (the Global Lake Status Data Base), vegetation distribution at 18 14C kyr and 6 14C kyr BP (BIOME 6000), aeolian accumulation rates during the last glacial-interglacial cycle (DIRTMAP), and tropical terrestrial climates at the Last Glacial Maximum (the LGM Tropical Terrestrial Data Synthesis) are summarised. Each has been used to evaluate simulations of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21 calendar kyr BP) and/or mid-Holocene (6 cal. kyr BP) environments. Comparisons have demonstrated that changes in radiative forcing and orography due to orbital and ice-sheet variations explain the first-order, broad-scale (in space and time) features of global climate change since the LGM. However, atmospheric models forced by 6 cal. kyr BP orbital changes with unchanged surface conditions fail to capture quantitative aspects of the observed climate, including the greatly increased magnitude and northward shift of the African monsoon during the early to mid-Holocene. Similarly, comparisons with palaeoenvironmental datasets show that atmospheric models have underestimated the magnitude of cooling and drying of much of the land surface at the LGM The inclusion of feedbacks due to changes in ocean- and land-surface conditions at both times, and atmospheric dust loading at the LGM, appears to be required in order to produce a better simulation of these past climates. The development of Earth system models incorporating the dynamic interactions among ocean, atmosphere, and vegetation is therefore mandated by Quaternary science results as well as climatological principles. For greatest scientific benefit, this development must be paralleled by continued advances in palaeodata analysis and synthesis, which in turn will help to define questions that call for new focused data collection efforts.",

Model results are presented for two test periods, the whole of one winter for which daily observations are available, and a short subset for which hourly data were presented. The best results are those given by MACRO with an expert user, although satisfactory results were also obtained from CRACK-NP and for the longer test period by PLM. SIMULAT was less successful in modelling the site because it did not include an adequate representation of the site hydrology, it was unable to predict the leaching of pesticide. MACRO was also used by a second modelling group who were less familiar with both the code and the site. Although the initial uncalibrated runs from this group were poor, the final calibrated results were almost as good as those derived by the 'expert' user. The simulations showed the difficulty of deriving adequate representations, even where relatively complete soil physical data are available. A shortcoming of the dataset provided was the lack of detailed soil moisture observations, particularly to define the initial conditions. From a well-monitored site, many observations of site hydrology (water table position, drainflow and surface flow) were available, but significantly, fewer pesticide concentrations in either the soil or the discharges were available. Models could thus be evaluated only in terms of their ability to predict the magnitude and timing of major pesticide leaching events. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In the case of bentazone, most model predictions were within the 95% confidence intervals of the observations. In the case of ethoprophos, model performance was often poor due to the ignorance of volatilization, kinetic sorption and adaptation of the microbial population.

        "Absrtact": "The performance of 10 deterministic one-dimensional dynamic pesticide leaching models with different complexity was evaluated using data collected on a humic sandy soil with a shallow ground water table in the Netherlands. Both mechanistic models, based on the solution of the governing flow equations (the Richards equation for soil water and the convection dispersion equation for solute flow) and functional, more empirical models were considered in the analysis. Simulations were carried out by 18 modellers allowing the characterisation of model performance in terms of user specific model parameterisation. Both uncalibrated and calibrated results are presented which demonstrate the impact of model calibrations on modelling results. In this paper, the ability of the models to correctly represent the physical transport processes is evaluated, while in a subsequent paper (Tiktak, 2000. Agric. Water Manage. Vol. 44, pp 119-134), the potential of the models to represent pesticide fate correctly will be assessed. Model calibration had a major impact on the simulation of water flow in soils. In general, after calibration, the Richards' type models were superior to the capacity type models. However, user-specific hydraulic parameter estimation procedures introduce considerable variability in model performance which sometimes overrules conceptual model differences (Richards'/capacity). The evaluation of the solute transport component of the models was inhibited by the lack of reliable tracer data. Heat transport modelling in the top soil was not felt as being a bottleneck in our modelling technology. A plea is made for developing good modelling practices in which guidelines for selecting robust parameter estimation methods are defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

This paper presents the methodology and major conclusions of a test of pesticide-leaching models. Twelve models simulating the vertical one-dimensional movement of water, solute, heat, and, in particular, pesticides, through the soil profile were used by 36 different modellers. The adopted modelling codes differ in terms of modelling concepts and modelling hypothesis. Modellers were affiliated to industry and to the scientific community as well. Four quality datasets were identified to perform the analysis. The dataset included field and lysimeter data, collected in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and the UK. As well, non-structured as structured soils were available in the dataset. To elucidate the ability to model correctly water transport, solute transport, heat transport and pesticide transport in soils, a stepwise evaluation approach was followed. Splitting up the experimental dataset enabled us to quantify the calibration capability and the prediction capability of the models. The simulations were performed by different model users enabling us also to characterise output variability in terms of user dependent interpretation of the model input and parameters. Recommendations are formulated for improving the quality of modelling datasets, and the process description of water, solute, and heat transport in a pesticide-leaching model, plus the process description of pesticide fate. Application of the principles of good modelling practice (GMP) is briefly described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Complete national registries of adult cardiac surgery have already been established in many European countries, the USA, Canada and elsewhere. Participating centres contributing to a national registry benefit by being able to benchmark themselves against norms for their particular country. A risk-adjusted database can help surgeons advise their patients of the chances of a good operative outcome. For a surgeon or a surgical unit, the only way to obtain a relevant risk model is to use their own data, and data from units in their particular country. It is also useful to have comparative data from other national registries to compare one's own country with international benchmarks. Since 1996, the European Cardiac Surgical Registry (ECSUR) has put considerable effort into producing unified datasets, harmonised with each other for worldwide use. In 1997, ECSUR launched a minimum cardiac surgical dataset. The worldwide launch of the full international adult cardiac surgical dataset is scheduled for July/August 2000. This dataset would be highly useful for application in Australia. The ECSUR organisation has the capability to analyse data from other countries and could perform this for Australia if requested. However, a better approach would be a national centre in Australia. Funding for national registries around the world has been obtained from Ministries of Health, participating surgical centres, and surgical software vendors. If an Australian national registry is indeed established it will find a ready-made, highly appropriate international cardiac surgical dataset sponsored by ECSUR and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons waiting for adoption by Australia.",

A functional C => T polymorphism in the Cathepsin D gene (CATD) has been reported to be associated with increased risk for AD in Caucasian case-control studies; specifically, the T-carrying genotypes confer increased risk. We have examined this association in our own Caucasian dataset of 210 AD cases and 120 controls, and in an additional Hispanic dataset comprising 79 AD cases and 112 controls. In Hispanics we find a modest interaction between CATD genotype and age of onset on risk for AD, such that the non-T-carrying genotype confers increased risk. In our Caucasian dataset we find no evidence for association between the CATD polymorphism and AD, although we do observe a small tendency towards an increase in the T-carrying genotypes in the case group, consistent with previous studies. We conducted an aggregate analysis of the published Caucasian datasets and found evidence that this CATD polymorphism (or another locus in linkage disequilibrium) does contribute significant, but small (<2%) risk for AD.

The parameters used were logP (log [octanol/water partition coefficient]) and molecular volume (to model the partition of the surfactants into the membranes of the eye), logCMC (log critical micelle concentration - a measure of the reactivity of the surfactants with the eye) together with surfactant concentration. The model was constructed using neural network analysis. MAS showed strongly positive, non-linear correlations with surfactant concentration and logCMC and a strongly negative, non-linear correlation with logP. The Pearson correlation between the actual and predicted values of MAS was 0.838 showing that around 70% (r2=0.702) of the variance in the dataset is explained by the model. This value is consistent with levels of biological variability reported historically for the Draize rabbit eye test. The relationship provides a potentially useful prediction model for the eye irritation potential of new or untested cationic surfactants with physicochemical properties lying within the parameter space of the model. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Samples for growth determinations were collected from two separate lake basins using different fishing methods. As a result, the length ranges in the two samples were different (84-248 mm in the Laitialanselka basin and 40-260 mm in the Enonselka basin). When back-calculations were based on the datasets collected separately from the two basins, the mean length at age 1 was higher in Laitialanselka than in Enonselka in six out of eight cohorts. When the two body-scale samples were pooled and used for both basins, the mean length at age 1 in Laitialanselka never exceeded that in Enonselka. According to the separate body-scale samples, the difference in the growth rate of roach between basins widened during the 1980s, whereas with the pooled body-scale sample no such conclusion could be drawn. When roach <80 mm were omitted from the pooled body-scale sample, the back-calculated length of the roach cohort 1989 at age 1 was 5% higher than the length obtained with the whole dataset, whereas truncation in the upper end of the dataset had no effect. With minimum sizes of 100 and 120 mm, the error was 13% and 25%, respectively. The effect of length truncation decreased clearly with increasing value of b in the power function describing the body-scale relationship. The error caused by length truncation was more than doubled when the value of b was changed from 0.8 to 0 6. The results demonstrated that length truncation in the body-scale plot should be taken into account in the back-calculation of fish lengths, especially in fish populations having a clearly curvilinear body-scale relationship.",

In vivo, the complete peripheral arterial bed of six patients was studied, from the aorto-iliac bifurcation down to the distal run-off. By measuring the signal intensity (SI) over the lumen of a vessel in the MIP, an SI-plot was obtained. Next, the vessel boundaries were determined using a threshold algorithm; from these boundary points individual diameter values could be obtained along the trajectory of the vessel. In an in vitro study, an optimal threshold value of 30% of the range of SI-values between the background and the maximal SI in the vessel was obtained for accurate diameter measurement in Gd CE MRA (i.e., full-width 30%-maximum). Furthermore, the relationship between the accuracy of these measurements and the scan resolution was investigated. Accuracy was found to be acceptable (i.e., less than 10% over/underestimation) for vessel sizes covering at least 3 pixels. In six patients, diameters were measured in MIPs of the total datasets (i.e., D(T)) as well as in selective MIPs of the clipped datasets (i.e., D(S)) (n = 209). D(T) and D(S) were statistically significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with a Pearson correlation coefficient r(P) = 0.98. Measurements in the total MIPs yielded statistically significant (p < 0.01) smaller diameter values compared with measurements in selective MIPs, with a mean difference of 0.15 mm. Diameter values from the selective MIPs of the aorto-iliac arteries were also compared with diameter values measured at corresponding anatomic positions in X-ray angiograms of these patients (i.e., D(X)) (n = 70). D(X) and D(S) were statistically significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with a Pearson correlation coefficient r(P) = 0.92. Diameters measured in the selective MIPs were smaller than those measured in the X-ray angiograms (mean difference 0.49 mm) and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). In conclusion, diameter values can be evaluated accurately in MIPs of vessels with at least 3 pixels in diameter, using the full-width 30%-maximum criterion.",

A conventional regrowth delay analysis based on means or medians of dose groups was contrasted with a one-step procedure using the inverse of individual regrowth delay times, where cured tumors are represented by an infinite delay time. Two data sets with different proportions of cured tumors were compared in this way. In addition, for both approaches, confidence limits were also generated by the bootstrap technique.Results: The parameter estimated was the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio. The inverse analysis yielded similar results as the conventional analysis, but with much smaller confidence limits. When the dataset was stripped by stepwise removal of lower dose groups with no cures, the estimates of the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio remained definitely more robust in inverse analysis. Results of the bootstrap procedure confirmed the accuracy of the calculated confidence intervals.Conclusion: Regrowth delay analysis using reciprocal regrowth delay times is a useful tool, especially when the data shows large variations, or a substantial fraction of the dataset falls into the curative dose region.

        "Absrtact": "Bank gullies are gullies that are formed due to a height drop caused by a terrace or a river bank, which develop by headward retreat in erodible hillslopes. This study aims (i) to investigate the morphology of actively eroding bank gullies, i.e., geometrical characteristics resulting from past erosion and active erosion processes shaping the gully, and, (ii), to find relationships with environmental site characteristics, such as topographical parameters, material properties and climate. The ultimate goal is to identify the most important controlling factors of past and present bank gully erosion. Fifty-five active bank gullies formed in different lithologies by various erosion processes have been selected in the Guadalentin basin and the surroundings of Guadix (Southeast Spain). For each bank gully site, geometrical and topographical parameters of both the channel and the drainage basin were measured. Erosion features indicating activity at the gully head, such as tension cracks, plunge pools, undercutting, fluting, piping and rill or sheet erosion on sloping side walls were mapped, and samples were taken from distinct lithological layers that were considered to influence the type and intensity of erosion processes. A relationship could be shown between the presence of piping and fluting and a number of material characteristics, including particle size distribution, dispersion behaviour and electrical conductivity. On the other hand, lithology appeared not to be a differentiating factor on gully development in the long run, as expressed by the total eroded volume (V). This parameter was most strongly related to the drainage basin area in which the entire bank gully had been formed (A(o)), explaining 66% of the variance. The relationship is V = 1.75(*) A(o)0.59. No significant difference was found between regression lines through sub-datasets of different soil textural classes. Finally, multiple regression was used to include both topographical parameters and material characteristics in an explanatory and/or predictive equation for the total eroded bank gully volume. The results of the analyses using the entire dataset, including the sites in the Guadalentin as well as in the Guadix area, have been compared with the results for the separate study areas. Differences are not only related to topographical and lithological characteristics, but may also be the consequence of a different climate in the two areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Likewise, for polar paths, we show that a large part of the signal could be explained by deep mantle structure. The effects of complex structure in the deep mantle on PKP(AB-DF) travel times should be carefully considered in order to reliably estimate the anisotropic structure of the central part of the inner core.

        "Absrtact": "Many attempts to test selectionist and neutralist models employ estimates of synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates of orthologous genes. For example, a stronger Ka-Ks correlation than expected under neutrality has been argued to indicate a role for selection and the absence of a Ks-GC4 correlation has been argued to be inconsistent with neutral models for isochore evolution. However, both of these results, we have shown previously, are sensitive to the method by which Ka and Ks are estimated. Using a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator (GY94) we found a positive correlation between Ks and GC4 and only a weak correlation between Ka and Ks, lower than expected under neutral expectations. This ML method is computationally slow. Recently, a new ad hoc approximation of this ML method has been provided (YN00). This is effectively an extension of Li's protocol but that also allows for codon usage bias. This method is computationally near-instantaneous and therefore potentially of great utility for analysis of large datasets. Here we ask whether this method might have such applicability. To this end we ask whether it too recovers the two unusual results. We report that when the ML and earlier ad hoc methods disagree, YN00 recovers the results described by the ML methods, i.e. a positive correlation between GC4 and Ks and only a weak correlation between Ks and Ka. If the ML method can be trusted, then YN00 can also be considered an adequately reliable method for analysis of large datasets. Assuming this to be so we also analyze further the patterns. We show, for example, that the positive correlation between GC4 and Ks is probably in part a mutational bias, there being more methyl induced CpG \u2192 TpG mutations in GC rich regions. As regards the evolution of isochores, it seems inappropriate to use the claimed lack of a correlation between GC and Ks as definitive evidence either against or for any model. If the positive correlation is real then, we argue, this is hard to reconcile with the biased gene conversion model for isochore formation as this predicts a negative correlation. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "When spectral variation caused by factors different from the parameter to be predicted (e.g. external variations in temperature) is present in calibration data, a common approach is to include this variation in the calibration model. For this purpose, the calibration sample spectra measured under standard conditions and the spectra of a smaller set measured under changed conditions are combined into one dataset and a global calibration model is calculated. However, if highly non-linear effects are present in the data, it may be impossible to capture this external variation in the model. Recently, a new technique, which is based on selection of robust variables, was proposed for constructing robust calibration models. In this technique, a calibration model is developed which uses a subset of spectral values that are insensitive to external variations.This new technique is compared with global calibration models for constructing robust models in spectrometric applications. Both techniques are applied to two different near infra-red (NIR) spectroscopic applications. The first is the determination of the ethanol, water, and iso-propanol concentrations in a ternary mixture of these components; the second is the determination of the density of heavy oil products. In both applications, the calibration set spectra have been measured at a standard sample temperature and a subset has been measured at sample temperatures deviating from the standard temperature. It has been found that models based on robust variable selection are similar or sometimes better than global calibration models with respect to their predictive ability at different sample temperatures.

We investigated the potential impact of error in a USGS 30 m DEM on terrain analysis over 27 km2.

        "Absrtact": "Traditionally, researchers have used either off-the-shelf models such as COCOMO, or developed local models using statistical techniques such as stepwise regression, to obtain software effort estimates. More recently, attention has turned to a variety of machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule induction (RI). This paper outlines some comparative research into the use of these three machine learning methods to build software effort prediction systems. We briefly describe each method and then apply the techniques to a dataset of 81 software projects derived from a Canadian software house in the late 1980s. We compare the prediction systems in terms of three factors: accuracy, explanatory value and configurability. We show that ANN methods have superior accuracy and that RI methods are least accurate. However, this view is somewhat counteracted by problems with explanatory value and configurability. For example, we found that considerable effort was required to configure the ANN and that this compared very unfavourably with the other techniques, particularly CBR and least squares regression (LSR). We suggest that further work be carried out, both to further explore interaction between the enduser and the prediction system, and also to facilitate configuration, particularly of ANNs.",

We establish the uniform consistency and derive the asymptotic distribution of the local parameter estimates and of the corresponding regression and derivative estimates. For estimating the regression function our method has superior performance compared to the usual kernel estimators at or near the parametric model. It is particularly well motivated for binary data using the probit or logit parametric model as a base.

        "Absrtact": "Whilst satellite radar altimetry has been widely utilised over both ocean and ice surfaces for topographic mapping, applications over land have received relatively little attention. This is in part due to the complex nature of echoes returned from rapidly varying topographic land surfaces, which can cause an altimeter to generate erroneous range estimates. One approach to improving these data is to retrack using a single retracker, and construct a spatial average of heights obtained to give an estimate of mean orthometric height. This paper presents results obtained using an alternative approach: reprocessing returns at all levels of complexity through an expert system, which chooses one from a series of ten reprocessing algorithms based on an analysis of the return waveform shape. The selected algorithm then recalculates the range to surface, and hence derives an orthometric height. Utilising this approach with the geodetic mission dataset from ERS-1 has generated over 100 million height points with a near-global distribution. This paper presents selected results from this research using ERS-1 geodetic mission data together with ERS-1 and ERS-2 35 day data to demonstrate the accuracy to which orthometric heights can be determined, using global crossover analysis and comparison with ground truth. The paper illustrates applications of these data including validation and error correction of Digital Elevation Models, and discusses use and limitations of direct mapping with altimetry.

In the boreal mixedwood, successional trajectories exhibit significant variability, thereby making classification systems based on age or seral stage difficult to apply. Furthermore, a lack of extensive datasets on forest structure prevents comprehensive, multivariate classification of stands. Alternatively, we designated old growth status using the proportion (\u226515%) of large trees (\u226540 cm DBH) and the subcanopy/canopy tree ratios (>1.5). With these riteria, approximately 11.4% of the boreal mixedwood landbase within northeastern Alberta has an old growth structure. Proportionally, more old growth structure was found in aspen and white spruce mixedwood types, with lesser proportions in pure aspen and white spruce stands. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the tree size criteria was the most important driving variable in determining the amount of old growth. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Purpose/Objective: We performed a retrospective computed tomography (CT)-based three-dimensional (3D) dose-volume analysis of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial breast implants to evaluate the adequacy of lumpectomy cavity coverage, and then designed a simple, reproducible algorithm for dwell-time adjustment to correct for underdosage of the lumpectomy cavity.Methods and Materials: Since March 1993, brachytherapy has been used as the sole radiation modality after lumpectomy in selected protocol patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. In this protocol, all patients received 32 Gy in 8 fractions of 4 Gy over 4 days. Eleven patients treated with HDR brachytherapy who underwent CT scanning after implant placement were included in this analysis. For each patient, the postimplant CT dataset was transferred to a 3D treatment planning system, and the relevant tissue volumes were outlined on each axial slice. The implant dataset, including the dwell positions and dwell times, were imported into the 3D planning system and then registered to the visible implant template in the CT dataset. The calculated dose distribution was analyzed with respect to defined volumes via dose-volume histograms. Due to the variability of lumpectomy cavity coverage discovered in this 3D quality assurance analysis, dwell times at selected positions were adjusted in an attempt to improve dosimetric coverage of the lumpectomy cavity. Using implant data from 5 cases, a dwell-time adjustment algorithm was designed and was then tested on 11 cases. In this algorithm, a point P was identified using axial CT images, which was representative of the underdosed region within the cavity. The distance (d) from point P to the nearest dwell position was measured. A number of dwell positions (N) nearest to point P were selected for dwell time adjustment. The algorithm was tested by increasing the dwell times of a variable number of positions (N = 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 20) by a weighting factor (\u03b1), where \u03b1 = f(d) and \u03b1 > 1, and subsequently performing 3D dose-volume analysis to evaluate the improvement in lumpectomy cavity coverage.Results: Before adjustment in the 11 implants, the median proportion of the lumpectomy cavity and target volume that received at least the prescription dose was 85% and 68%, respectively. After dwell-time adjustment, lumpectomy cavity coverage was significantly improved in all 11 cases. The median distance from point P to the nearest dwell position (d) was 1.4 cm (range 0.9-1.9). The median volume of the lumpectomy cavity receiving 32 Gy increased from 85.3% in the actual implant to 97.0% (range 74-100%) by increasing the dwell time of a single dwell position by a median factor (\u03b1) of 12.2 according to the above algorithm. With N = 3, the median proportion of the cavity volume receiving 32 Gy was improved to 97.5% (range 77-100%), with a median \u03b1 of 5.7. Further improvement in lumpectomy cavity coverage was relatively small by increasing additional dwell times. In addition, with N = 20, the median absolute volume of breast tissue receiving 150% of the prescription dose was 70.3 cm3 compared to 26.3 cm3 in the actual implant; whereas with N = 1 or N = 3, this median volume was only 35.9 and 42.0 cm3, respectively.Conclusion: Lumpectomy cavity coverage sometimes appears suboptimal with interstitial HDR breast brachytherapy using our current technique. A simple dwell-time increase at only 1-3 dwell positions can compensate for some underdosage without creating significant regions of overdosage. Using simple methodology, a single reference point representing the underdosed region can be utilized for initial selection of the dwell positions to be increased.

The application of a sophisticated image processing software on an adequate PC (Dual Pentium II, 300 MHz) was necessary for the file management of the datasets, the calculation of TM data ratios (R), principal components (PC) and selected color composites (CC) which have been found more appropriate for the geological interpretation at a regional scale. These low resolution, but multispectral data (e.g. color composites) have been merged with high resolution panchromatic images to obtain new, high resolution images without loss of multispectral information.

When plate movements are fairly well constrained, the Cenozoic provides a dense network of palaeomagnetic directions. The general pattern displays eastward declinations broadly distributed over a large distance - from the Ionian islands to the western Greek Rhodope - and westward declinations, less accurately constrained in space and time, in the Southern and Eastern Aegean and in Western Anatolia. Emphasis is given to the evaluation of this dataset by comparing it with new concepts of the regional tectonics. In the Mesozoic-Palaeozoic, more scarcely covered, reliable information is provided about latitudinal movements, resulting in a suggested palaeolatitude of 15-20\u00b0N for almost all studied areas. A model proposing prevailing counterclockwise rotations in the internal Hellenides and strong clockwise rotations for the external Hellenides appears plausible. Finally, issues for future research are outlined. For example.

The largest rhipicephaline genus, Rhipicephalus, was represented by ticks from six of the species groups, the second largest genus, Dermacentor, by species from two of three of its subgenera, and the genus Boophilus by 3 of its 5 species. We analyzed 12S and COI sequences separately and together; statistically significant incongruence between the 12s rDNA and the COI sequences was not detected in the combined dataset using the incongruence length difference test. The combined dataset provided greater phylogenetic resolution than the individual datasets, and although 12S rDNA data had only 25% of the parsimony-informative characters, it provided half of the total partitioned Bremer support for the combined dataset. We present the first hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among some species groups of Rhipicephalus but our most controversial result was that the genus Rhipicephalus is apparently paraphyletic, unless species of boophilus are included in it. The species of Rhipicephalus most closely related to Boophilus spp. were from the R. pravus and R. evertsi species groups, which may implicate an African origin for this important group of ticks.

        "Absrtact": "This paper deals with improvements in the accuracy and precision of attenuation measurements in the Earth, obtained from observations of surface waves and free oscillations. We focus our study on the observation of the resonant frequencies of the Earth and propose an improved method for deriving attenuation data from the free-oscillation amplitude decays that reduces uncertainties. We test our method on different theoretical seismograms computed for two different Earth models, a spherically symmetric one (the PREM model) and a laterally heterogeneous one (the M84A model). We compute seismograms for: the spheroidal fundamental mode only, the fundamental mode and overtones, without noise and with actual noise. Some biases related to the method are systematically found and corrected. Our conclusion is that if we fulfill some conditions in attenuation measurements by taking into account different parameters, such as the observed resonance period, the relative amplitude of the peak for the particular great-circle path considered, the noise level of the component in the station considered, it is possible to reduce the uncertainty in amplitude measurements. Doing this, we are more confident in free-oscillation measurements than in those of surface waves. It is evident that the presence of noise may increase the mean Q inferred from long-time series if no care is taken relative to the signal-to-noise level. The method is then systematically applied to a dataset of about one thousand vertical seismograms provided by the GEOSCOPE network after various large earthquakes, which occurred from 1982 to 1995. We determine reliable estimates of the mean frequency and attenuation of the fundamental spheroidal mode for the angular order range l = 21-51 (period range 175-336 s). Some results are discarded for reasons explained. We compare the consistency of this new dataset with previously published Q observations and commonly used models (PREM, Q(M1), Q(L6)). We point out the difficulties of obtaining reliable Q factors and show the discrepancies between surface waves and normal modes measurements. It is noted that surface wave attenuation measurements may be strongly affected by the time window used in order to extract each particular surface wave train, but fit normal modes results, in some cases.

        "Absrtact": "A simplified methodology for development of calibrations for binary powder mixtures using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is presented. It is demonstrated that multivariate calibration can be performed using only a small calibration dataset of two to five samples. The intrinsic heterogeneity of the powder mixtures at the sample size effectively measured using standard fibre-optic probes prevents the assignment of a true reference content value to each obtained spectrum. Instead, the nominal mixture content of the sample is used as reference value. To obtain a spectrum more representative of each sample, a mean spectrum is computed from several spectra collected from different sample sub-fractions. Two principally different powder mixtures were used in this study: one composed of two fine powders (d < 300 \u03bcm) and the other mixture composed of one fine (d50 = 170 \u03bcm) and one coarse (d50 = 590 \u03bcm) powder. In the case of mixing fine powders, the calibration model is obtained by PLS regression using two PLS components after spectral data pre-treatment with multiplicative signal correction (MSC). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the powder content variation determined by NIR is wavelength dependent due to the dependence of effective sample size on radiation wavelength. In the case of mixing one fine and one coarse powder, the large difference in particle size between the two powder components cause a non-linear X-Y relationship, which can be handled by means of spectral averaging and a non-linear (QPLS) regression. In both cases, the first PLS loading vector was interpreted as describing the difference between the spectra of the two pure components. The presented methodology should be useful for applications of NIR spectroscopy in processes involving powder mixtures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Neoproterozoic (Sinian) sediments are exceptionally well preserved in the Three Gorges region (western Hubei Province) of the South China block. We report new paleomagnetic results, obtained independently by two separate laboratories, from a total of 157 samples of the 748 \u00b1 12 Ma, basal Sinian Liantuo Formation at its type locality. Detailed thermal demagnetization procedures and least-squares line analyses reveal three distinct magnetic components among the suite of samples. Two overprint components can be distinguished from each other by their laboratory unblocking temperatures. The first to be removed ('C'), always annihilated below 600\u00b0C, is common throughout the dataset but is amenable to least-squares line-fitting in only 37 samples. It yields a pole which in present coordinates resembles Mesozoic overprints identified from previous studies in the Three Gorges region (75.7\u00b0N, 174.3\u00b0E, d(p) = 6.0\u00b0, d(m) = 8.3\u00b0, Q = 4). The higher unblocking-temperature overprint ('B'), always subsidiary to the 'A' component, is more prevalent than 'C' and was identified by line-fitting in 67 samples. The 'B' direction is very steep and generates a paleopole whose in situ coordinates do not resemble the Mesozoic-Cenozoic apparent polar wander path for South China, and whose tilt-corrected coordinates (20.3\u00b0N, 106.2\u00b0E, d(p) = 7.2\u00b0, d(m) = 7.3\u00b0, Q = 5) bear no resemblance to any reliable Phanerozoic paleopoles from the South China block. The steep 'B' direction, if an unbiased representative of an ancient geomagnetic dipole field, was probably acquired some time in the 200 m.y. interval between deposition of the Liantuo Formation at ~750 Ma and Cambrian time. The most stable component is a two-polarity remanence, removed at temperatures predominantly >630\u00b0C, which we infer to reside in hematite. A change in polarity of this component occupies a similar stratigraphic position (within 5 cm) among three outcrops separated by ~100 m lateral distance. We calculate a mean paleomagnetic pole from each of the laboratories' datasets and combine these with a previously determined pole from correlative rocks in Yunnan ['N1' of Zhang and Piper, Precambrian Res. 85 (1997) 173-199], to obtain an overall weighted mean paleomagnetic pole (04.4\u00b0N, 161.1\u00b0E, A95 = 12.9\u00b0, Q = 7) for the South China block at 748 \u00b1 12 Ma. The combined 'Z1' pole is considered to be primary based on its thermal stability, its magnetostratigraphic consistency, and a soft-sediment fold test determined by previous work. Results from individual sampling areas constrain the depositional paleolatitude of the Liantuo Formation and equivalent Sinian rocks to 30-40\u00b0. This result applies to one or both of the stratigraphically adjacent Chang'an and Nantuo glacial deposits; unfortunately, it is neither high nor low enough to refute any of the conceptual models for the enigmatic Neoproterozoic glaciations. The new basal Sinian paleopole, in the context of recent paleomagnetic and geochronological results from Australia, suggests that the Nantuo glaciation is pre-Marinoan. The new 'Z1' pole may also provide constraints on the various proposed reconstructions of South China's position in Rodinia. In particular, a paleoposition adjacent to northwestern Australia at ~750 Ma requires a specific relative orientation between the two blocks. Likewise, if Rodinia were still intact by 750 Ma, South China may have lain between Australia and Laurentia only in an orientation different from that originally proposed in the 'missing link' hypothesis. As a final alternative, the new paleomagnetic data could be used to position South China, Australia, and Laurentia in an immediately post-Rodinian paleogeography around the nascent Pacific Ocean.

        "Absrtact": "In situ energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques have been employed to study the hydrothermal formation of crystalline tobermorite and xonotlite. Alkoxide gels of tobermorite composition with varying aluminium contents (Al/(Al + Si) = 0 to 0.15) were reacted with a saturated calcium hydroxide solution at temperatures varying from 190\u00b0C to 310\u00b0C on the saturated vapour pressure curve. Reaction products consisted of tobermorite, xonotlite or a mixture of both. Tobermorite is stabilised by increasing aluminium content and decreasing temperature, whereas xonotlite forms at higher temperature and lower aluminium contents. Reaction times ranged from 3 to 5 h, with the first Bragg peaks forming within the first 10 min. The formation mechanism involves a two-stage process. Firstly, a poorly crystalline C-S-H gel phase forms, which has good periodicity parallel to the ab plane but is poorly ordered parallel to the c direction. The second stage involves the ordering of the C-S-H gel along the (001) direction to form ordered crystalline tobermorite or xonotlite. Kinetic analysis indicates that the reaction rate is increased with increasing aluminium content and increasing temperature. Activation energies for these reactions at different aluminium contents were calculated from two datasets; firstly, from the change in 2 \u03b8 position of the tobermorite(220)/xonotlite(320) peak during the reaction (19-30 kJ/mol) and secondly, from the rate at which the background hump intensity decreases for each experiment (26-33 kJ/mol).

The correlations and the uncertainties on shear-wave velocities defining the elastic model are estimated by using a procedure based on the same thermodynamic analogies. As a relevant feature, the simulated annealing algorithm permits reducing the usual dependence of the solution on the sometimes arbitrary starting model. A shortcoming linked to the use of this procedure for solving an inversion problem is the necessity of a previous empirical determination of some parameters controlling the annealing process. With this aim, a simulation of a joint inversion of synthetic surface wave dispersion data has been performed. After that, path-averaged velocity dispersion curves corresponding to a Hercynian area of the Iberian Peninsula have been inverted to derive two possible crust and upper mantle elastic structures. Whereas, the first structure has been deduced by considering as unknown variables the shear velocities of the stratified Earth model, the second has been obtained also including the respective layer thicknesses. Both structures are compared with shear velocity and Q\u03b2 models derived by the stochastic inversion procedure in previous studies and from the same Rayleigh waves dataset. Finally, advantages and shortcomings of the inversion of phase and group velocity data by means of simulated annealing are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Existing measurements from South Australia define a broad (> 250 km wide) zone of anomalously high surface heat flow (92 \u00b1 10 mW m-2). This zone is centred on the western margin of the Adelaide Fold Belt (Neoproterozoic to early Phanerozoic cover floored by Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic basement), where it borders the eastern Gawler Craton and Stuart Shelf (Palaeoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic). To the west, in the western Gawler Craton (Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic), heat flow averages ~ 54 mW m-2 while to the east in the Willyama Inliers (Palaeoproterozoic) heat flow averages ~ 75 mW m-2. We use a regional geochemical dataset comprising > 2500 analyses to show that the anomalous heat flow zone correlates with exceptional surface heat production values, mainly hosted in Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic granites. The median heat production of Precambrian 'basement' rocks increases from < 3 \u03bcW m-3 west of the anomalous zone to ~ 6 \u03bcW m-3 within the anomalous zone. In the highest known part of the heat flow anomaly, Mesoproterozoic gneisses and granites of the Mount Painter Province in the northern Adelaide Fold Belt yield an area-integrated mean heat production of 9.9 \u03bcW m-3. These data suggest that the anomalous heat flow reflects an unusual enrichment in U and Th in this part of the Proterozoic crust, with the total complement of these elements some 2-3 times greater than would be expected for Proterozoic crust on the basis of the global heat flow database. This extraordinary enrichment has played an important role in modulating the thermal regime of the crust in this region, and particularly its response to tectonic activity.

The recent development of efficient new approaches allows for the wider application of theoretically unbiased sampling and estimation techniques that are devoid of the assumptions and models of earlier methods. In this review, we outline the historical background and recent advances in the estimation of total length for biological objects on tissue sections, including a practical method to estimate the length of cholinergic fibers using newly developed methods. These newer methods also take advantage of three-dimensional image datasets and virtual probes, techniques that may have wider application in quantitative morphometry.

It permits, therefore, evaluation of the purely mnemonic portions of working memory tasks without requiring the 'cognitive subtraction' of nonmnemonic components of such tasks, such as visual processing and motor output. Features of this event-related fMRI technique include the empirical derivation of an impulse response function (IRF) from each subject participating in the experiment, single-subject and random effects group analyses, use of t-values of dependent measures, and the use of regions of interest (ROI) to improve the sensitivity of a priori contrasts.

The objective is to provide insights on the interactions between grassland dynamics and water and energy budgets. These three years exhibit drastically different precipitation regimes and thus different vegetation growth. The result of the coupled model showed that for the 3 years, the observed seasonal variation of plant biomass, leaf area index (LAI) are well reproduced by the model. It is also shown that the model simulations of soil moisture, radiative surface temperature and surface fluxes compared fairly well with the observations. Reflectance data in the red, near infrared, and short wave infrared (SWIR, 1600 nm) bands measured by the VEGETATION sensor onboard SPOT-4 were corrected from atmospheric and directional effects and compared to the observed biomass and LAI during the 1998-1999 seasons. The results of this 'ground to satellite' approach established that the biomass and LAI are linearly related to the satellite reflectances (RED and SWIR), and to vegetation indices (NDVI and SWVI, which is a SWlR-based NDVI). The SWIR and SWVI sensitivity to the amount of plant tissues were similar to the classical RED and NDVI sensitivity, for LAI ranging from 0 and 0.8 m2 m-2 and biomass ranging from 0 to 120 g DM m-2. Finally, LAI values simulated by the vegetation model were fed into a canopy radiative transfer scheme (a 'model to satellite' approach). Using two leaf optical properties datasets, the computed RED, NIR and SWlR reflectances and vegetation indices (NDVI and SWVI) compared reasonably well with the VEGETATION observations in 1998 and 1999, except for the NIR band and during the senescence period, when the leaf optical properties present a larger uncertainty. We conclude that a physically-sound linkage between the vegetation model and the satellite can be used for red to short wave infrared domain over these grasslands. These different results represent an important step toward using new generation satellite data to control and validate model's simulations at regional scale.

Seven ecological indices (S, number of phytoplankton species; N, total number of individuals; DMg, Margalef\u2019s index; DMn, Menhinick's index; DOd, Odum\u2019s species per thousand individuals; H\u2019, Shannon\u2019s Diversity index; E, Evenness index), based on phytoplankton community data collected from Saronicos Gulf, Greece were used for describing the eutrophication state of the sea environment. A representation of the spatial distribution for each ecological index was developed using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. A eutrophication scale for each index was also developed for indicating four different trophic levels in the marine environment (eutrophic, upper-mesotrophic, lower-mesotrophic, oligotrophic); categorization of the interpolated values of each index resulted in a clear illustration of these trophic levels on seven thematic maps. Two methodological procedures were finally applied for synthesizing the information of these thematic maps. The purpose was the development of a final map illustrating the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the study area. The first procedure was based on the integration of unsupervised and supervised classification methods, widely used in the field of remote sensing, while the second one on the overlay technique, simply carried out within the frame of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The hybrid unsupervised/supervised classification method can assess the optimal number of classes in which data values from simultaneously considered parameters could be allocated, while the overlay technique is an additive procedure not taking into account existing trends in the dataset. The advantages and disadvantages of each procedure are further discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "We report Pb isotopic compositions for 35 samples of the volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea from the Hawaiian Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP-1) core at Hilo. These data were obtained with an external precision of ~ 100 ppm (2\u03c3(ext.)) on the ratios 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb by using a Pb triple spike to correct for instrumental mass fractionation. The Pb isotopic compositions in the lower section (1200 to 280 m) of the core sample 200 to 400 ka-old Mauna Kea lavas, and display two well-defined linear arrays in 207Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb isotope spaces. There is a suggestion that Mauna Loa (0 to 280 m depth) also displays such linear array(s). However, analysis of the Mauna Loa samples is complicated by residual contamination and/or sample heterogeneity. While these latter data exhibit a satisfactory array in 208Pb/204Pb vs. 206Pb/204Pb, there still remains scatter in 207Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb space, making it difficult to assess the true Pb isotope systematics of Mauna Loa. The presence of two linear Pb isotopic arrays in Mauna Kea can be interpreted as either reflecting two parallel isochrons or in terms of binary mixing. If interpreted as isochrons, the 207Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb systematics correspond to an age of ~ 1.9 Ga. Comparison of measured Th/U ratios in the lavas and those inferred from Pb isotope systematics strongly suggest that the Pb isotopic arrays reflect binary mixing, and this bears directly on the question of how many distinct components are present in the Hawaiian plume. Most of the new Mauna Kea data lie well outside the mixing-component triangle defined in the literature by the 'Kea', 'Loihi', and 'Koolau' components. On the basis of the relationships between Pb isotope ratios in 3D and a principal component analysis of the Mauna Kea Pb isotope dataset, we show here that a three-component mixing model can in principle explain both mixing lines. However, such an explanation requires a highly specific set of mixing conditions in order to produce parallel arrays in Pb isotope space (2D and 3D). Therefore, our preferred interpretation is that the two arrays reflect binary mixing, with four discrete source components involved in the generation of the Kea lavas. Comparison of the Pb isotope characteristics of these lavas with those of East Pacific Rise (EPR) MORB glasses further suggests that EPR-type Pacific lithosphere does not contribute to the source of Kea lavas. The position of samples along the mixing lines does not correlate with stratigraphic height in the core, and therefore the age of the lavas. Rather, it appears as though the relative proportions of the endmembers are controlled by the spatial configuration of these endmembers, and by melting and transport processes in the source itself. The stratigraphic fluctuations of Pb and Sr isotopes contrast with the monotonic decrease of \u03b5(Nd) and \u03b5(Hf) values as a function of age. This may in part be explained by differences in analytical precision of isotope measurements relative to the total range of values observed. This analytical resolution is far higher for Pb than for the other radiogenic isotopes. Alternatively, the observed fluctuation may be caused by the mobility of lead (as well as Rb and/or Sr) during the ancient differentiation process that created the differences in parent-daughter ratios.

        "Absrtact": "The variation of soil compactibility and its relationship to plasticity, texture, organic matter and particle density is considered for 156 sites and for one intensively sampled site. These sites were concentrated in east Scotland and were the locations of Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) field experiments and surveys related to tillage and compaction. Compactibility was determined by a rammer method on sieved soil. The coefficient of variability of compactibility (as maximum dry bulk density) was relatively low between sites (9.5%) and within site (4%). The soils covered a wide range of textures; sand contents ranged from 1.7 to 93.5 g 100 g-1 and clay contents ranged from 2.5 to 49.1 g 100 g-1. However, liquid limit was more important than particle size fractions in the prediction of compactibility. Loss-on-pretreatment prior to measurement of particle soil distribution was taken as a measure of readily oxidisable soil organic matter. This fraction was more variable and more relevant than total organic matter in determining mechanical behaviour. Compactibility was predicted adequately by a combination of loss-on-pretreatment and liquid limit. Maximum dry bulk density and liquid limit were identified as important characteristics of the dataset and would be suitable parameters for measurement of soil physical/behavioural quality. Although particle density was not particularly important in predicting compactibility, it ranged from 2.36 to 2.87 Mg m-3. Awareness of this variability is important for properties estimated by a calculation involving particle density. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Efficient content-based access, however, needs a good description and representation of multimedia information. In the paper, we present descriptors for color and shape information in images that we proposed for MPEG-7. In particular, we describe two ways of capturing color content in images called Color Histogram and Region Color. These descriptors are suitable for a wide variety of applications requiring image-to-image matching and object-to-image matching. We also present descriptors for capturing shape information on objects and within images called affine structure and location hash tree. These shape descriptors enable a pose-invariant localization and recognition of 2d patterns. The utility of color and shape descriptors is demonstrated through experiments on the MPEG-7 dataset.",

Hypotheses of the monophyly of Fusarium subglutinans and its two formae speciales, f. sp. pini and f. sp. ananas, were strongly rejected by a likelihood analysis.

The La Palma sediment wave field covers some 20,000 km2 of the continental slope and rise, and consists of sediment waves with wave heights of up to 70 m and wavelengths of up to 2.4 km. The wave crestlines have a complex morphology, with common bifurcation and a clear sinuosity. Waves have migrated upslope through time. Cores recovered from the wave field contain volcaniclastic turbidites interbedded with pelagic/hemipelagic layers. The wave field is interpreted as having formed beneath unconfined turbidity currents. A simple, previously published, two-layer model is applied to the waves, revealing that they formed beneath turbidity currents flowing at 10-100 cm/s-1, with a flow thickness of 60-400 m and a sediment concentration of 26-427 mg/l. The El Julan sediment wave field lies within a turbidity current channel on the southwest flank of El Hierro. The sediment waves display wave heights of about 6 m and wavelengths of up to 1.2 km. The waves are migrating upslope, and migration is most rapid in the centre of the channel where the flow velocity is highest. This wave field has been formed by channelised turbidity currents originating on the flanks of El Hierro. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "South of New Zealand the Pacific-Australia (PAC-AUS) plate boundary runs along the intracontinental Alpine Fault, the Puysegur subduction front and the intraoceanic Puysegur Fault. The Puysegur Fault is located along Puysegur Ridge, which terminates at ca. 47\u00b0S against the continental Puysegur Bank in a complex zone of deformation called the Snares Zone. At Puysegur Trench, the Australian Plate subducts beneath Puysegur Bank and the Fiordland Massif. East of Fiordland and Puysegur Bank, the Moonlight Fault System (MFS) represents the Eocene strike-slip plate boundary. Interpretation of seafloor morphology and seismic reflection profiles acquired over Puysegur Bank and the Snares Zone allows study of the transition from intraoceanic strike-slip faulting along the Puysegur Ridge to oblique subduction at the Puysegur Trench and to better understand the genetic link between the Puysegur Fault and the MFS. Seafloor morphology is interpreted from a bathymetric dataset compiled from swath bathymetry data acquired during the 1993 Geodynz survey, and single beam echo soundings acquired by the NZ Royal Navy. The Snares Zone is the key transition zone from strike-slip faulting to subduction. It divides into three sectors, namely East, NW and SW sectors. A conspicuous 3600 m-deep trough (the Snares Trough) separates the NW and East sectors. The East sector is characterised by the NE termination of Puysegur Ridge into right-stepping en echelon ridges that accommodate a change of strike from the Puysegur Fault to the MFS. Between 48\u00b0S and 47\u00b0S, in the NW sector and the Snares Trough, a series of transpressional faults splay northward from the Puysegur Fault. Between 49\u00b050'S and 48\u00b0S, thrusts develop progressively at Puysegur Trench into a decollement. North of 48\u00b0S the Snares Trough develops between two splays of the Puysegur Fault, indicating superficial extension associated with the subsidence of Puysegur Ridge. Seismic reflection profiles and bathymetric maps show a series of transpressional faults that splay northwards across the Snares Fault, and terminate at the top of the Puysegur trench slope. Between ca. 48\u00b0S and 46\u00b030'S, the relative plate motion appears to be distributed over the Puysegur subduction zone and the strike-slip faults located on the edge of the upper plate. Conversely, north of ca. 46\u00b0S, a lack of active strike-slip faulting along the MFS and across most of Puysegur Bank indicates that the subduction in the northern part of Puysegur Trench accounts for most of the oblique convergence. Hence, active transpression in the Snares fault zone indicates that the relative PAC-AUS plate motion is transferred from strike-slip faulting along the Puysegur Fault to subduction at Puysegur Trench. The progressive transition from thrusts at Puysegur Trench and strike-slip faulting at the Puysegur Fault to oblique subduction at Puysegur Trench suggests that the subduction interface progressively developed from a western shallow splay of the Puysegur Fault. It implies that the transfer fault links the subduction interface at depth. A tectonic sliver is identified between Puysegur Trench and the Puysegur Fault. Its northwards motion relative to the Pacific Plate implies that is might collide with Puysegur Bank. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "This descriptive paper presents experimental data on diurnal cycling in the upper ocean on the shelf of Southern Brazil. Data were collected by three Brazilian research vessels at 10 individual sites, between 24\u00b0S and 33\u00b0S. During the measurements, the ships were stationed or drifted. At every location, series of temperature, salinity and density profiles were taken in the upper 50 m, accompanied by shipboard meteorology observations. At some locations, measurements of surface and underwater solar irradiance were also performed. The duration of time series varied from 8-72 h. The sampling intervals ranged between 0.5 and 3 h but normally were of one hour. Total duration of the series was 186 h, and the total number of individual hydrographic profiles in the dataset amounts to 159. The diurnal cycle of temperature was determined by fitting a sum of diurnal and semi-diurnal Fourier harmonics to the data. The diurnal range of SST varied from 0.1\u00b0C to over 1.2\u00b0C, controlled mostly by cloudiness and wind speed. The average range was about 0.5\u00b0C for summer and 0.4\u00b0C for winter observations. In most cases the observed diurnal cycle of temperature was confined to the uppermost 10 to 15 m. The phase lag between solar irradiance and sea temperature was normally about 4 h at the surface and increased downwards, typically by about one hour per every meter of depth. The sensible and latent fluxes exhibited regular diurnal variability. The divergence of the turbulent heat flux at a given depth in the bulk of the water column showed pronounced diurnal cycle, sometimes changing from - 150 to + 50 W m-3 in the course of 8 to 12 h. A strong diurnal cycle of stratification was observed in the northern part of the region, with the average night-time values of buoyancy frequency smaller than the day-time ones approximately by one order of magnitude, while south of 31\u00b0S stratification was mostly salinity controlled and represented small diurnal variation. In 3 of the observations, the night-time surface cooling led to convective instabilities and related overturns soon after midnight, resulting in rapid restratification of the water column and sign reversal of turbulent heat flux. The vertical size of the overturns was about 10 m in two of the three cases and over 20 m in the third case, while the temporal scale was 1-3 h.",

These lists can then be used by existing CF algorithms by encoding them as 'pseudo-users'. Importantly, the spider can collect useful data without pre-programmed knowledge about the format of particular pages or particular sites. Instead, the CF spider uses commercial Web-search engines to find pages likely to contain lists in the domain of interest, and then applies previously proposed heuristics to extract lists from these pages. We show that data collected by this spider are nearly as effective for CF as data collected from real users, and more effective than data collected by two plausible hand-programmed spiders. In some cases, autonomously spidered data can also be combined with actual user data to improve performance.",

The most popular solutions available today have been designed with some sets of specific needs in mind and usually, they are not always able to satisfy, equally well, the different kinds of communications which can be found in the industrial and process control environments. Often, system integrators and designers are forced to trade responsiveness (needed in event-driven systems) for efficiency (mostly required in systems which are based on the periodic polling of the controlled devices), or vice-versa. In this paper, a modification of the basic ISO 11898 protocol is described which supports some new transmission services that significantly increase the communication efficiency for periodic exchanges of process data and for messages devoted to high level functions. These services maintain a good degree of compatibility with the original protocol and do not affect its very good responsiveness and flexibility. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Heat capacity measurements have been performed on birch plants (Betula pendula Roth.) by use of a drop-Cp-microcalorimeter. Influence of hydration level on heat capacity was investigated. It was found that heat capacity decreased in a linear fashion with decreasing water content until a point of discontinuity was reached at a water fraction of 0.2gg-1 (grams of water per gram fresh biomass). A linear regression of the region above 0.2gg-1 gave a slope of 2.49JK-1g-1 and an intercept of 1.72JK-1g-1. It was concluded that a rough division of the water in the biomass into free and perturbed water is reflected in the heat capacity of the system and that the heat capacity in the region below 0.2gg-1 could be divided into three discrete subregions. These subregions are assumed to reflect the perturbed water state in the tissue at different levels of hydration. Further, the temperature influence on heat capacity was studied in the range between 14 and 37\u00b0C. The water fraction in these experiments was 0.75\u00b10.1gg-1. No significant difference in heat capacity values was observed. It was concluded that this result reflects the dominant influence of free water on heat capacity at this level of water content. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "TNT Equivalency methods are widely used for vapour cloud explosion blast modeling. Presently, however, other types of models are available which do not have the fundamental objections TNT Equivalency models have. TNO Multi-Energy method is increasingly accepted as a more reasonable alternative to be used as a simple and practical method. Computer codes based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) like AutoReaGas, developed by TNO and Century Dynamics, could be used also in case a more rigorous analysis is required. Application of the Multi-Energy method requires knowledge of two parameters describing the explosion: a charge size and a charge strength. During the last years, research has led to an improved determination of the charge strength (i.e., the class number or source overpressure) to be chosen to apply the blast charts. A correlation has been derived relating the charge strength to a set of parameters describing the boundary conditions of the flammable cloud and the fuel in the cloud. A simple approach may not be satisfactory in all situations. The overpressure distribution inside a vapour cloud explosion is generally not homogeneous and the presence of obstructions causes directional blast propagation in the near field. A CFD approach, in which the actual situation is modeled, supplies case-specific results. An overview of the key aspects relevant to the application of the Multi-Energy method and CFD modeling is provided. Then the application of the two methods is demonstrated for an example problem involving the calculation of the explosion blast load on a structure at some distance from the explosion in an offshore platform complex.

Unfortunately, the support provided by most Web sites to explore such databases is rather primitive and is based on the traditional database metaphor of submitting an SQL query and packaging the response as an HTML page. Very often, the result set is empty or contains too many records. It is up to the user to refine the query by guessing how the query constraints must be tightened or relaxed and then go through another submit/response cycle. Furthermore, once results are displayed, typically no further exploration capabilities are offered. Web applications requiring interactive exploration of databases (e.g. e-commerce) need that the above submit/response metaphor be replaced with a continuous querying metaphor that seamlessly integrates querying with result browsing. In addition to supporting queries based on predicates on attribute values, queries based on example records should also be supported. We present techniques for supporting this metaphor and discuss their implementation in a Web-based database exploration engine.",

Methods: A total of 254 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive treatment with E2 Matrix 0.10 mg (N=86), E2 Matrix 0.05 mg (N=82), or placebo (N=86) in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion for a period of 12 weeks continuously. Patches were applied twice weekly to the buttocks with each patient wearing two patches at all times. The primary efficacy criterion was the difference from baseline of the mean number of moderate to severe hot flushes per 24 h during the last 2 weeks of treatment. Other efficacy variables included reduction in hot flushes at 4 and 8 weeks, reduction in daytime flushing and night sweats, and Kupperman Index at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: E2 Matrix 0.10 and 0.05 mg were both significantly superior to placebo in reducing hot flushes per 24 h after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment (P<0.001). Also, for all other efficacy parameters studied, both dosage strengths of E2 Matrix were statistically significantly superior to placebo at all time points (P<0.001). Local tolerability was good in both groups. A slight increase in estrogen related adverse effects (breast tenderness, leukorrhoea) was seen with the 0.10 mg patch. Adhesion of patches and compliance were good. Overall systemic tolerability was good in both treated groups. However, a 4.8% overall incidence of endometrial hyperplasia was observed in patients with an intact uterus. Conclusions: This new matrix patch offers an effective and well tolerated dosage form for delivery of 0.05 and 0.1 mg estradiol per day. It may be particularly suitable for those women who experience local sensitivity to alcohol-containing systems. In light of the observed hyperplasia after treatment in five patients, estrogen therapy should as yet be supplemented monthly with a progestogen in women with an intact uterus.

Mass spectral classification models were built for carbamates and their substructures using temperature-constrained-cascade correlation networks (TC-CCNs). The carbamate classifier was applied to the mass spectral scans of a GC-MS run. The classification models were built from reference and experimental mass spectra. Different network configurations were compared that used multiple network models with single outputs and single networks with multiple outputs. A major source of variation caused by randomly partitioning the training and prediction sets was reduced by an order of magnitude by using a method of Latin-partitions. This method also furnished a precision measure for comparing classification methods. Multiple networks with single outputs generally predicted better than single networks with multiple outputs. Hierarchical single output networks achieved better than 98% classification accuracy in one study.

        "Absrtact": "Information theory provides a theoretical framework for addressing fundamental questions concerning the nature of neural codes. Harnessing its power is not straightforward, because of the differences between mathematical abstractions and laboratory reality. We describe an approach to the analysis of neural codes that seeks to identify the informative features of neural responses, rather than to estimate the information content of neural responses per se. Our analysis, applied to neurons in primary visual cortex (V1), demonstrates that the informative precision of spike times varies with the stimulus modality being represented. Contrast is represented by spike times on the shortest time scale, and different kinds of pattern information are represented on longer time scales. The interspike interval distribution has a structure that is unanticipated from the firing rate. The significance of this structure is not that it contains additional information, but rather, that it may provide a means for simple synaptic mechanisms to decode the information that is multiplexed within a spike train. Extensions of this analysis to the simultaneous responses of pairs of neurons indicate that neighboring neurons convey largely independent information, if the decoding process is sensitive to the neuron of origin and not just the average firing rate. In summary, stimulus-related information is encoded into the precise times of spikes fired by V1 neurons. Much of this information would be obscured if individual spikes were merely taken to be estimators of the firing rate. Additional information would be lost by averaging across the responses of neurons in a local population. We propose that synaptic mechanisms sensitive to interspike intervals and dendritic processing beyond simple summation exist at least in part to enable the brain to take advantage of this extra information.

        "Absrtact": "Beacon Valley, Antarctica, contains unique remnants of glacier ice underneath a till layer covering the valley floor. To constrain the age and evolution of this important indicator of Antarctic paleoclimate, we analyzed two dolerite erratics from the till surface and one from within the ice for cosmogenic helium and neon. A conservative minimum exposure age of the older surface sample is 2.3 Ma, but taking into account erosion, the true exposure age of this boulder is likely to be considerably higher. The buried sample contains more than 20 times less cosmogenic noble gases than the old surface sample, although its current shielding would imply only a three times lower production rate. This indicates that the ice level has slowly been lowered by sublimation at the rate of a few m/Ma. The high exposure age of the surface sample as well as the very low sublimation rate of the relict ice both support the conclusion that the remnant ice in Beacon Valley was deposited many million years ago [Sugden et al., Nature 376 (1995) 412-414] and has never been thinner than at present. In addition, we found that cosmogenic helium and neon are released quantitatively from pyroxene at temperatures of < 900\u00b0C and > 1000\u00b0C, respectively. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The potential sources of anthropogenic radionuclides to the Ob River system of western Siberia include global stratospheric fallout, tropospheric fallout from atomic weapons tests and releases from production and reprocessing facilities. Samples of water, suspended and bottom sediments collected in 1994 and 1995 have been used to characterize the sources and transport of 137Cs, Pu isotopes, 237Np and 129I through the system. For the radionuclides that associate with particles, isotope ratios provide clues to their sources, providing any geochemical fractionation can be taken into account. Activity ratios of 239.240Pu/137Cs in suspended sediments are lower than the global fallout ratio in the Irtysh River before its confluence with the Ob, comparable to fallout in the central reach of the Ob, and greater than the fallout values in the lower Ob and in the Taz River. This pattern mirrors the downriver decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Laboratory adsorption experiments with Ob River sediment and water show that K(d) values for Am (and presumably other actinides) are depressed by two orders of magnitude in the presence of Ob DOC concentrations, relative to values measured in DOC-free Ob water. Iodine and cesium K(d) values show little or no (less than a factor of 2) dependence on DOC. Mixing plots using plutonium isotope ratios (atom ratios) show that Pu in suspended sediments of the Ob is a mixture of stratospheric global fallout at northern latitudes, tropospheric fallout from the former Soviet Union test site at Semipalatinsk and reprocessing of spent fuel at Tomsk-7. Plutonium from Semipalatinsk is evident in the Irtysh River above its confluence with the Tobal. Suspended sediment samples taken in the Ob above its confluence with the Irtysh indicate the presence of Pu derived from the Tomsk-7 reprocessing facilities. A mixing plot constructed using 237Np/239Pu vs. 240Pu/239Pu shows similar mixtures of stratospheric and tropospheric fallout, with the likely addition of inputs from reprocessing facilities and reactor operations. As with Pu/Cs ratios, Np/Pu ratios could be modified by differential geochemical behaviors of Np and Pu. Dissolved 129I only weakly interacts with particles in the Ob; size-fractionated sampling shows that the colloidal 129I fraction (defined as 1 kDa-0.2 \u03bcm) contains generally < 5% relative to that passing a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. Iodine-129 concentrations decrease from 8.3 X 109 to 0.65 X 109 atoms 1-1 through the Ob system toward the Kara Sea, with highest values in the Tobal River and lowest in the Taz River. The likely source of the elevated 129I in the Tobal is release from the production-reprocessing facilities at Mayak, and decreases downriver are predominantly due to dilution as the various tributaries with low 129I join the system. Fluxes of 129I to the lower Ob at Salekhard are < 1% of the releases of this radionuclide from the nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities at Sellafield, UK and La Hague, France.

The present HGTUB98 gravimetric solution was based on terrestrial gravity data, height data and the EGM96 geopotential model; and was computed with the 1D Spherical FFT method. The gravity data were used in the area 45.5\u00b0\u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 49\u00b0, 16\u00b0\u2264 \u03bb \u2264 23\u00b0, the resolution of the grid was 30\u2033 x 50\u2033. The DTM used had a resolution of 1 km x 1 km. Our solution was evaluated using GPS/levelling data at 340 and 308 points respectively and at 138 vertical deflection points. We have compared our solution to the European EGG97 geoid solution, the gravimetric solution HGR97B developed by A. Kenyeres and the lithospheric geoid solution by G. Papp. We have correlated our recent HGTUB98 solution to the Moho model of Central Europe. The comparison with GPS/levelling yielded respectively an accuracy of \u00b18.7 cm and \u00b14.4 cm (in terms of standard deviation) when a linear trend was removed. The comparison of the 1D planar FFT solution for the deflections of the vertical with 138 astrogeodetic deflections yielded an accuracy (in terms of standard deviation) of \u00b10.62\u2033 and \u00b10.52\u2033 for \u03be and \u03b7, respectively.

The agreement between the model and a cruise carried out in May 1993 is qualitatively good. The model is also able to represent the seasonal cycle in the area as revealed by cruises carried out in November 1993 and July/August 1994. Quantitative agreement between the model and the observations is less good and this is a result of limitations in the data used to force the model at the surface and the boundaries. Features of the circulation which are modeled well include seasonal coastal upwelling, the winter Portugal Coastal Countercurrent and the spreading of Mediterranean Water. Coastal upwelling occurs in summer and is enhanced off Cape Finisterre and Cape Roca. The Portugal Coastal Countercurrent exists in the model as a poleward flow over the upper continental slope which is strongest in winter but persists throughout the year and in summer is seen as a weak sub-surface feature. Mediterranean Water spreads northwards in two cores with a distinct focussing towards the coast to the north of the Tagus Plateau. The particular form of open boundary conditions employed perform well with little evidence of false reflection of outgoing waves. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The biogeography of living calcareous nannoplankton for the southeastern Indian Ocean offshore of Western Australia was studied by analyzing 192 filter samples collected within the upper 200 m of the ocean at 33 stations. The cell density of total nannoplankton decreased significantly in some nearshore stations along the Western Australian coast where the Leeuwin Current flows. A total of 92 taxa were identified by SEM observation from 118 of the samples, i.e. those which had common nannoplankton and allowed the distinction between upper- and lower-photic zone floras. The most abundant taxa were classified into three main groups and two independent species based on their distribution pattern. Of the latter, Umbellosphaera irregularis is common in the shallower samples in the tropics, whilst Gephyrocapsa oceanica occurs in isolated patches. Group U taxa (Discosphaera tubifera, Rhabdosphaera clavigera var. stylifera and Umbellosphaera tenuis) occur in the shallower depths of the subtropical water. Group UL taxa, which include Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericasonii, Syracosphaera spp., Umbilicosphaera hulburtiana and various other taxa whose coccospheres are covered by holococcoliths (holococcolithophores), are common in the subtropics. Group L taxa, which are composed of Florisphaera profunda. Oolithotus antillarum, Gladiolithus flabellatus and Algirosphaera oryza, are most common in the deep water. In order to clarify the mega-trends of floral variations in the upper- and lower-photic zone communities, we obtained the following two rations. The ratio of U. irregularis to groups U + UL in the upper-photic community is positively related to temperature, whereas its relationship with salinity and water density is negative. In the lower-photic community, the ratio of group L to UL varies in the nutrient-poor environments, but is consistently high in eutrophic environments. The occurrence of G. oceanica is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity and lower water density in the upper-photic community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Lesions in estuarine finfish are associated with a variety of organisms including parasites and bacterial, viral, and fungal infectious agents. In addition, trauma, suboptimal water quality, and other abiotic stress factors may result in the loss of homeostasis. We have observed solitary ulcerative lesions on menhaden sampled from the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, the Pamlico River, North Carolina, and the St. Johns River, Florida. Histologically, the lesions demonstrated a marked chronic inflammatory infiltrate and granulomas in response to fungal hyphae throughout large areas of exposed necrotic muscle. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria were also observed in the lesions, a common finding in ulcers of aquatic organisms. Similar observations in menhaden and other species have been described previously in the literature as ulcerative mycosis, mycotic granulomatosis, red spot disease, and epizootic ulcerative syndrome. Despite the many different known causes of fish lesions, the popular press and the scientific literature have recently emphasized Pfiesteria piscicida and other Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates (and their bioactive compounds) as the primary causative agent for finfish lesions, particularly mycotic granulomatous ulcers in Atlantic menhaden. While some laboratory data suggest that Pfiesteria may play a role in field-observed lesions, much more cause-and-effect evidence is needed to determine the importance of other risk factors, both alone or and in combination with Pfiesteria. In order to better understand the etiology of lesion initiation and progression in estuarine finfish, accurate assessments of environmental conditions collected on appropriate temporal and spatial scales, and fish morphological indicators consistent with gross and histological pathologic terminology, should be used for reporting fish lesion observations and kills. Further, this outlook will help to avoid bias and may foster a broader perspective for examining the health of estuarine systems in general. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Pseudorank estimation is a ubiquitous problem in multivariate data analysis. Many pseudorank estimation methods currently in use are based on the size of the eigenvalues calculated in abstract factor analysis (AFA). The basic assumption behind these methods is that the eigenvalues, when ordered according to their size, form two distinct sets, namely the so-called primary eigenvalues, that explain the systematic variation in the data together with embedded error, and the so-called secondary eigenvalues, that consist only of noise. This paper shows that a strict separation of eigenvalues in a primary and secondary set can not be expected a priori if the noise in the data is heteroscedastic. The main conclusion is that proper data pre-treatment is required to facilitate AFA-based pseudorank estimation. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Soil water and nutrients are considered as non limiting in the model. To evaluate the model, results of historical field trials as well as of field trials especially conducted for this evaluation study were used. These data concern growth, yield and sugar content of sugar beets grown on sandy, loess and clay profiles in Belgium and the Netherlands during several growing seasons.

A series of 17 binary mixtures was created using different proportions of the two enantiomeric forms. Sample mixtures were dispersed as a 5% (w/w) mix in KBr, and spectra were measured immediately after mixing.The original spectra were sampled between 650.16 and 3999.40 wavenumbers (cm-1) and reduced to 1738 spectral intensities during the data collection. These spectral data were further processed to smooth the noise in the spectrogram. Reduction and transformation of the input data enhanced the ANN performance. The 1738 reflectances were reduced to 173 averaged spectral values, each from 10 consecutive wavenumbers. Two ANNs models with one or two hidden layers were trained, tested and validated. Both models had 173 averaged spectral values as the inputs and two output neurons, one for the percentage of each ibuprofen enantiomer. The number of hidden layers and hidden neurons was optimized.The ANN model was built by comparing the predictions obtained from several high scoring models. The best results were obtained with two hidden layers having six hidden neurons in each layer.The method is highly sensitive and precise. A working range of 1-100% of the R(-)-enantiomer present as an impurity in S(+)-enantiomer was established with a minimum quantifiable level (MQL) of 1.67% and a limit of detection (LD) of 0.5% (w/w).

It does not require sum-of-squared residuals as fitting criteria and, hence, allows data analysis that is also robust against extraneous data.

The frequency of treatment- associated adverse events (AEs) in the atorvastatin LDL-C \u226480 mg/dl (2.1 mmol/l) subgroup (24%) was comparable to the frequencies observed for all atorvastatin-treated patients (20%) and for patients receiving the other statins (24%). Patient withdrawals due to treatment-associated AEs (constipation, dyspepsia and flatulence being the most common) were consistent and low across treatment groups. No treatment-associated deaths occurred in any group. Safety data for 21 atorvastatin-treated patients with LDL-C \u2264 50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) were also analyzed and found to be similar to all atorvastatin-treated patients and patients treated with the other statins. While recognizing the short-term nature of the data (all patients who received atorvastatin were treated for \u2264 1 year and approximately 30% were treated for \u2264 6 months), this analysis suggests that reducing LDL-C levels below 80 (2.1 mmol/l) or 50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) with atorvastatin does not alter its safety profile, as measured by frequency of AEs, which remains similar to those of other statins.

Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the effects of soil and crop management practices on nitrate leaching, however, there are few studies which examine new technologies to reduce nitrate leaching from agricultural land. In this study, technological advances in water table management are used in combination with conservation tillage and intercropping treatments to determine if nitrate leaching can be effectively reduced in a clay loam soil. There were two water table management treatments and four crop management treatments arranged in a 2 by 4 factorial arrangement with two replicates. The water table management treatments consisted of controlled drainage/subirrigation system (CDS) and a free drainage system (FD). The crop management treatments consisted of moldboard plow tillage with and without an annual ryegrass intercrop (MP, MP + IC) and soil saver (modified chisel plow) with and without an annual ryegrass intercrop (SS, SS + IC). The data was modeled using LEACHM and a mean error difference procedure was used to determine how well the model predicted the field data. The model worked well when the difference between the predicted and measured values approached zero. When the CDS system was modeled, the mean error difference values ranged from -1.67 to 0.33 mg N l-1 for the 4 crop management treatments whereas the values were considerably greater when the FD system was modeled with values ranging between 7.48 and 12.7 mg N l-1. Hence the LEACHM model predicted nitrate leaching better on plots under CDS system than on plots under FD. Both the Leaching Estimation and Chemistry Model (LEACHM) predicted scenarios and field sampled data showed that CDS reduced nitrate leaching substantially. Model calibration by using one full year of field data was found to be acceptable, but for predictions based on shorter calibration periods unsatisfactory results were obtained.",

        "Absrtact": "He, Ne and Ar concentrations, He and Ar isotopic ratios, carbon isotopic ratios and chemical compositions of hydrocarbon gases were measured in natural gas samples from gas-producing wells in the Indus basin, Pakistan, where no oil has ever been found. 3He/4He ratios are in the range 0.01-0.06 Ra (Ra is the atmospheric value of 1.38 X 10-6) indicating the absence of mantle-derived helium despite the Trias extension. 40Ar/36Ar ratios range from 296 to 800, consistent with variable additions of radiogenic argon to atmospheric, groundwater-derived argon. Rare gas concentrations show large variations, from 6 X 10-5 to 1 X 10-3 mol/mol for 4He and from 3 X 10-7 to 3 X 10-5 mol/mol for 36Ar. In general, 36Ar concentrations are high compared to literature data for natural gas. CO2 and N2 concentrations are variable, ranging up to 70 and 20%, respectively. Mantle-derived He is not observed, therefore CO2 and N2 are not mantle-derived either. Hydrocarbon gas maturity is high, but accumulation efficiency is small, suggesting that early-produced hydrocarbons, including oil, were lost as well as mantle helium. This is consistent with the generally late, Pliocene, trap formation, and explains the high N2 concentrations, since N2 is the final species generated at the end of organic matter maturation. Based on \u03b413C data, CO2 originates from carbonate decomposition. Very elevated 20Ne/36Ar ratios are found, reaching a maximum of 1.3 (compared to 0.1-0.2 for air-saturated water and 0.5 for air), and these high values are related to the lowest rare gas concentrations. We suggest that this highly fractionated signature is the trace of the past presence of oil in the basin and appeared in groundwater. We propose a model where oil-water contact is followed by gas-water contact, both with Rayleigh distillation for rare gas abundance ratios, thereby generating the fractionated 20Ne/36Ar signature in groundwater first and transferring it to gas later. Assuming the gas-water contact occurred shallower than present reservoir depths, this model explains the generally high 36Ar concentrations and low CH4/36Ar ratios compared to other studies on younger basins. It thus provides a historical perspective on fluid transfer in a sedimentary basin, where a gas accumulation may have been buried to greater depth since formation. Rare gas and major element data point to mixing between two gas pulses produced successively. The very CO2-N2-rich gases are terminal products of organic matter maturation which have been trapped after important migration. This gas was followed by a more typical thermogenic gas which mixed with it. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Charcoal analysis of six shell mounds showed that no major changes of the mainland vegetation ecosystem have taken place along the southeastern Brazilian coast (22\u00b053'-22\u00b057'S, 42\u00b003'-42\u00b033'W) from 5500 to 1400 14C yr BP. These shell mounds have been occupied by sedentary fisher-gatherer-hunters. Charcoal fragments retrieved from vertical profiles in the archaeological sites were examined; taxonomic determinations were based on a reference collection of charred woods and a program for computer-aided identification. Charcoal assemblages of all the studied sites present taxa from various restinga vegetation types, mangroves, xeromorphic coastal forest, and inland Atlantic Forest. The restinga ecosystem, characteristic of the Brazilian coast, is associated with sandy beach ridges; the restinga forest was much more abundant during the studied period than nowadays. The charcoal assemblages represent mainly the local vegetation; a regional reconstruction depends on the study of numerous sites. In the Cabo Frio region, open restinga taxa are more abundant in the Sambaqui do Forte, while forest elements are more important in the Sambaquis Salinas Peroano and Boca da Barra. The sites studied in the Arraial do Cabo (Sambaqui da Ponta da Cabeca) and in the Saquarema regions (Sambaquis da Pontinha and da Beirada) show that open restinga formations were locally predominant. A comparison of multivariate analysis applied to both charcoal assemblages and to phytosociological data of the extant vegetation showed a good correspondence between the charcoal spectra and the present vegetation. The high taxonomic diversity of archaeological charcoal samples and numerous fragments showing traces of decay before charring suggests that aleatory gathering of dead wood constituted the main source of firewood for fisher-gatherer-hunters populations. Condalia sp. was probably selected for cultural reasons. The only significant fluctuations on the charcoal spectra relate to the mangrove vegetation. Two relatively humid episodes (recorded from ca. 5500 to 4900/4500 and from ca. 2300 to 2000 14C yr BP), intercalated by two episodes of increased dryness with increased lagoon salinity (from ca. 4900/4500 to 2300 and from ca. 2000 to 1400 14C yr BP) were recorded in the Cabo Frio region. The changes in mangrove vegetation cannot be attributed to sea-level variations, for the three regressive and the two transgressive episodes identified for the Brazilian coast during this period are not in phase with the development of mangroves. The stability of the mainland vegetation ecosystem is probably due to the edaphic character of the coastal environments, which makes coastal formations much more resistant to climatic variations and less sensitive to climatic change. We propose that this environmental stability was a decisive factor in the maintenance of the fisher-gatherer-hunter sociocultural system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The Early Devonian Mount Buffalo granite is exposed today as an inselberg at the dissected western margin of the southeastern highlands of Victoria Australia. It dominates a block of deeply incised, Ordovician turbidites that appears structurally isolated from the surrounding highlands. By treating these highlands as an elastic plate subject to flexure or warping, previous workers have proposed that this region of the Lachlan Fold Belt has experienced a relatively simple thermotectonic and landscape evolution history following shallow-level intrusion of the granite. However, results of apatite and zircon fission-track analyses from the granite indicate the occurrence of major, previously unrecognized, episodes of: (1) heating/burial prior to ~246 Ma (Early Triassic), and prior to ~70 Ma (Late Cretaceous); and (2) rapid cooling/denudation at some time between ~246 and 220 Ma (Early to Late Triassic), and between ~70 and 50 Ma (Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary). While previous interpretations of the landscape history of the region suggest the prolonged, subaerial exposure of the granite following shallow crustal residence, our results clearly indicate this region of the Lachlan Fold Belt has experienced a dynamic post-Paleozoic history. Thus this new dataset forces a radical re-interpretation of the landscape evolution of the Mount Buffalo structural block, which has significant implications for our understanding of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic geomorphic and structural development of southeastern Australia. We therefore propose a model incorporating reactivation of wrench faults that may explain the complex thermotectonic history while accommodating the detailed observations of previous workers in this area.

        "Absrtact": "Geographical information systems (GIS) are becoming an increasingly integral component of natural resource management activities worldwide. However, despite some indication that these tools are receiving attention within the aquaculture community, their deployment for spatial decision support in this domain continues to be very slow. This situation is attributable to a number of constraints including a lack of appreciation of the technology, limited understanding of GIS principles and associated methodology, and inadequate organizational commitment to ensure continuity of these spatial decision support tools. This paper analyzes these constraints in depth, and includes reviews of basic GIS terminology, methodology, case studies in aquaculture and future trends. The section on GIS terminology addresses the two fundamental types of GIS (raster and vector), and discusses aspects related to the visualization of outcomes. With regard to GIS methodology, the argument is made for close involvement of end users, subject matter specialists and analysts in all projects. A user-driven framework, which involves seven phases, to support this process is presented together with details of the degree of involvement of each category of personnel, associated activities and analytical procedures. The section on case studies reviews in considerable detail four aquaculture applications which are demonstrative of the extent to which GIS can be deployed, indicate the range in complexity of analytical methods used, provide insight into issues associated with data procurement and handling, and demonstrate the diversity of GIS packages that are available. Finally, the section on the future of GIS examines the direction in which the technology is moving, emerging trends with regard to analytical methods, and challenges that need to be addressed if GIS is to realize its full potential as a spatial decision support tool for aquaculture.

The extent of population stratification pertaining to this database, an issue crucial for its practical forensic application, was assessed through analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of the 20 regional samples included. Despite the notion of some significant haplotype frequency differences, which were found to correlate with known demographic and historic features of Europeans, AMOVA generally revealed a high level of genetic homogeneity among the populations analyzed. Owing to their high diversity, however, accurate frequency estimation is difficult for Y-STR haplotypes when realistic (i.e. moderately sized) datasets are being used. As expected, strong pair-wise and higher order allelic associations were found to exist between all markers studied, implying that haplotype frequencies cannot be estimated as products of allele frequencies. A new extrapolation method was therefore developed which treats haplotype frequencies as random variables and generates estimates of the underlying distribution functions on the basis of closely related haplotypes. This approach, termed frequency 'surveying', is based upon standard population genetics theory and can in principle be applied to any combination of markers located on the Y-chromosome or in the mitochondrial genome. Application of the method to the quality assured reference Y-STR haplotype database described herein will prove very useful for the evaluation of positive trace-donor matches in forensic casework.

These efforts have been recognized and encouraged by bank regulators. Recently, banks have extended these efforts into the field of credit risk modeling. However, an important question for both banks and their regulators is evaluating the accuracy of a model's forecasts of credit losses, especially given the small number of available forecasts due to their typically long planning horizons. Using a panel data approach, we propose evaluation methods for credit risk models based on cross-sectional simulation. Specifically, models are evaluated not only on their forecasts over time, but also on their forecasts at a given point in time for simulated credit portfolios. Once the forecasts corresponding to these portfolios are generated, they can be evaluated using various statistical methods. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Data from one experiment were used to obtain a quantitative relationship between IgG levels and cumulative exposure. That relationship was validated against data from another experimental study and from natural field studies. The latter included different pasture management strategies with or without an anthelmintic treatment. Validation involved 'predicting' cumulative exposure for the groups of calves in the latter two datasets based on observed IgG levels measured with the CoES14.2 ELISA, and subsequently comparing those 'predictions' with observed cumulative exposures. Generally, 'predicted' cumulative exposures correlated well to observed exposures (r values of 0.7-0.9). However, 'predicted' cumulative exposures underestimated observed exposures in the natural field studies. Anthelmintic treatments in some of the groups of the natural field studies reduced the 'prediction' accuracy of the CoES14.2 ELISA. This suggests that cumulative exposure in relation to IgG levels is more accurately defined by the total amount of host-parasite contact than by the cumulative number of larvae ingested. It is concluded that IgG levels measured with the CoES14.2 ELISA allow evaluating how much exposure to infection calves have experienced in the first grazing season.

The model was calibrated on uptake and depuration kinetics datasets obtained for 14 organs/tissues during a 12-week experiment. Organs were classified into three compartments: an input compartment (gills), a distribution/reservoir compartment (muscles, skeleton and skin) and an excretional function compartment (digestive system and liver). For the three compartments, the partition coefficients and the residence time of the pollutant were, respectively: 161 and 4h, 87 and 1.5 days, and 1465 and 14 days. As an indirect validation technique, a steady-state concentration factor was calculated for the whole organism from the partition coefficient values and fractional volumes of the compartment.

        "Absrtact": "An extensive cruise program during 1994, 1995 and 1996 provided observations that describe the seasonal evolution of the three-dimensional density field in the western Irish Sea. A cold, dense pool flanked by strong nearbed density gradients was present from May until October. In spring, salinity had a dominant influence on the density structure but from June until October temperature controlled the density stratification. The trajectories of 55 satellite-tracked Argos drifters demonstrated the existence of the cyclonic circulation pattern that constitutes the western Irish Sea gyre and defined the gyre's spatial extent. Several distinct recirculation paths were observed and the implications for planktonic organisms of the seasonal variability in the recirculation are discussed. Drifter speeds were in good agreement with geostrophic calculations based on the observed density field and with de-tided acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements. The dynamical significance of strong nearbed gradients (bottom fronts) is highlighted. The location of the dynamically significant baroclinicity below the level of wind mixing explains the persistence of the cold pool and cyclonic circulation until late October. The dataset described here is valuable for environmental management purposes and it facilitates testing of the prognostic capabilities of the present generation of density advecting numerical models.

        "Absrtact": "The Ibero-Armorican Arc (IAA) is a huge geological structure of Pre-Cambrian origin, tightened during hercynian times and deeply affected by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the Bay of Biscay. Its remnants now lie in Iberia, north-western France and the Canadian Grand Banks margins. The qualitative correlation between these three blocks has been attempted by several authors (e.g. Lefort, J.P., 1980.

Tectonophysics 177, 293-305) using magnetic anomalies, mainly because they seem to preserve the hercynian zonation, in spite of the strong thermal and mechanical processes that took place during rifting and ocean spreading. In this paper, we present a new contribution to the study of the IAA structure based on the processing of a compilation of magnetic data from Iberia and Grand Banks margins. To interpret the magnetic signature, a Fourier-domain-based inversion technique was applied, considering a layer with a constant thickness of 10 km, and taking into account only the induced field. The digital terrain model was derived from ETOPO5 (ETOPO5, 1986. Relief map of the earth's surface. EOS 67, 121) and TerrainBase (TerrainBase, 1995. In: Row III, L.W., Hastings, D.A., Dunbar, P.K. (Eds.), Worldwide Digital Terrain Data, Documentation Manual, CD-ROM Release 1.0. GEODASNGDC Key to Geophysical Records. Documentation N. 30, April) databases. The pseudo-susceptibility distribution obtained was repositioned for the 156.5 Ma epoch, using the Srivastava and Verhoef [Srivastava, S.P., Verhoef, J., 1992.

(Ed.), Basins on the Atlantic Seaboard: Petroleum Geology Sedimentology and Basin Evolution, Geological Society Special Publication No. 62, pp. 397-420] pole. Using this coherent magnetic framework, we can verify that the continuity between adjacent blocks is quite good, in terms of the amplitude, wavenumber and magnetic susceptibility pattern. If we accept that the magnetic properties can be taken as a marker of the hercynian zonation, as was verified in previous studies (Miranda, J.M., Galdeano, A., Rossignol, J.C., Mendes-Victor, L.A., 1989.

Second, a closer look is taken at theoretically underlying dimensions of social and health consequences and their association with alcohol consumption. Using as empirical material data from the US national survey of males aged 21-59 (N3) conducted in 1969, the following specific questions are discussed: (1) What are the underlying dimensions of alcohol-related social and health consequences? (2) How should the relation between alcohol consumption and consequences best be assessed (in terms of epidemiological traditions or social constructivist traditions)? (3) How can we best incorporate the time perspective into modeling the relationship between alcohol consumption and consequences?

        "Absrtact": "Thioredoxins are small ubiquitous proteins which act as general protein disulfide reductases in living cells. Chloroplasts contain two distinct thioredoxins (f and m) with different phylogenetic origin. Both act as enzyme regulatory proteins but have different specificities towards target enzymes. Thioredoxin f (Trx f), which shares only low sequence identity with thioredoxin m (Trx m) and with all other known thioredoxins, activates enzymes of the Calvin cycle and other photosynthetic processes. Trx m shows high sequence similarity with bacterial thioredoxins and activates other chloroplast enzymes. The here described structural studies of the two chloroplast thioredoxins were carried out in order to gain insight into the structure/function relationships of these proteins. Crystal structures were determined for oxidized, recombinant thioredoxin f (Trx f-L) and at the N terminus truncated form of it (Trx f-S), as well as for oxidized and reduced thioredoxin m (at 2.1 and 2.3 \u00c5 resolution, respectively). Whereas thioredoxin f crystallized as a monomer, both truncated thioredoxin f and thioredoxin m crystallized as non-covalent dimers. The structures of thioredoxins f and m exhibit the typical thioredoxin fold consisting of a central twisted five-stranded \u03b2-sheet surrounded by four \u03b1-helices. Thioredoxin f contains an additional \u03b1-helix at the N terminus and an exposed third cysteine close to the active site. The overall three-dimensional structures of the two chloroplast thioredoxins are quite similar. However, the two proteins have a significantly different surface topology and charge distribution around the active site. An interesting feature which might significantly contribute to the specificity of thioredoxin f is an inherent flexibility of its active site, which has expressed itself crystallographically in two different crystal forms.

        "Absrtact": "Increasing nitrate levels in groundwater have been attributed to inappropriate nitrogen (N) management. The application rates, timing, and methods of both N fertilization and irrigation are important management tools that determine and control the fate and behavior of N in soil-plant systems. For example, multiple applications with small amounts of fertilizer (e.g. split application) usually enhance plant uptake and reduce potential nitrate leaching, although increasing costs. Precision N management requires that the models evaluate so many alternatives that traditional N models are challenged beyond their intended use. The objective of this study was to construct and test a model that searches for optimal N management to: (1) minimize nitrate leaching; (2) maximize production; and (3) maximize profits. Management-oriented modeling (MOM), a dynamic simulation modeling with artificial intelligence optimization techniques, was developed for these purposes. MOM consists of a generator that generates a set of plausible management alternatives, a simulator that evaluates each alternative, and an evaluator that determines which alternative meets the user-weighted multiple criteria. MOM uses 'hill-climbing' as a strategic search method that uses 'best-first' as a tactical search method to find the shortest path from start nodes to goals. In a maize production scenario, MOM found an optimal management solution that would have increased the profit from $570 to $935 ha-1 and reduced the nitrate leaching from 36 to 7 kg N ha-1. Goal-driven simulation of MOM offers new opportunities to balance N and irrigation water management while meeting multiple objectives. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Single-path inversions of 230 Rayleigh waveforms from 140 earthquakes mainly located in the Solomon Trench confirm the presence of an extremely thick crust, with an average depth to the Mohorovicic discontinuity of 33 km. The thickest crusts (38 km) are found in the southcentral part of the plateau, around 2\u00b0S, 157\u00b0E. Lesser values remaining much thicker than average oceanic crust (15-26 km) are found on either side of the main structure, suggesting that the OJP spills over into the Lyra Basin to the west. Such thick crustal structures are consistent with formation of the plateau at the Pacific-Phoenix ridge at 121 Ma, while its easternmost part may have formed later (90 Ma) on more mature lithosphere. Single-path inversions also reveal a strongly developed low-velocity zone at asthenospheric depths in the mantle. A three-dimensional tomographic inversion resolves a low-velocity root of the OJP extending as deep as 300 km, with shear velocity deficiencies of ~5%, suggesting the presence of a keel, dragged along with the plateau as the latter moves as part of the drift of the Pacific plate over the mantle.",

        "Absrtact": "The Western Gneiss Region (WGR) marks the outcrop of a composite terrane consisting of variably re-worked Proterozoic basement and parautochthonous or autochthonous cover units. The WGR exhibits a gross structural, petrographic and thermobarometric zonation from southeast to northwest, reflecting an increasing intensity of Scandian (late Palaeozoic) metamorphic and structural imprint. Scandian-aged eclogites have been widely (though for kinetic reasons not invariably) stabilised in metabasic rocks but have suffered varying degrees of retrogression during exhumation. In the region between the Jostedal mountains and Nordjord, eclogites commonly have distinctively prograde-zoned garnets with amphibolite or epidote-amphibolite facies solid inclusions suites and lack any evidence for stability of coesite (high pressure [HP] eclogites). In the south of this area, in Sunnfjord, eclogites locally contain glaucophane as an inclusion or matrix phase. North of Nordfjord, eclogites mostly lack prograde zoning and evidence for coesite, either as relics as relics or replacive polycrystalline quartz, is present in both eclogites (ultrahigh pressure [UHP] eclogites) and, rarely, gneisses. Coesite or polycrystalline quartz after coesite has now been found in eight new localities, including one close to a microdiamond-bearing gneiss. These new discoveries suggest that, by a conservative estimate, the UHP terrane, in the WGR covers a coastal strip of about 5000 km2 between outer Nordfjord and Moldefjord. A 'mixed HP/UHP zone' containing both HP and UHP eclogites is confirmed by our observations, and is extended a further 40 km east along Nordfjord. Thermobarometry on phengite-bearing eclogites has been used to quantify the regional distribution of pressure (P) and temperature (T) across the WGR. Overall, a scenario emerges where P and T progressively increase from 500\u00b0C and 16 kbar in Sunnfjord to > 800\u00b0C and 32 kbar in outer Moldefjord, respectively, in line with the distribution of eclogite petrographic features. Results are usually consistent with the silica polymorph present or inferred. The P-T conditions define a linear array in the P-T plane with a slope of roughly 5\u00b0C/km, with averages for petrographic groups lying along the trend according to their geographic distribution from SE to NW, hence defining a clear field gradient. This P-T gradient might be used to support the frequently postulated model for northwesterly subduction of the WGC as a coherent body. However, the WGC is clearly a composite edifice built from several tectonic units. Furthermore, the mixed HP/UHP zone seems to mark a step in the regional P gradient, indicating a possible tectonic break and tectonic juxtaposition of the HP and UHP units. Lack of other clear evidence for a tectonic break in the mixed zone dicatates caution in this interpretation, and we cannot discount the possibility that the mixed zone is, at least, partly a result of kinetic operating near the HP-UHP transition. Overall, if the WGC has been subducted during the Scandian orogeny, it has retained its general fown-slab pattern of P and T in spite of any disruption during exhumation. Garnetiferous peridotites derived from subcontinental lithospheric mantle may be restricted to the UHP terrane and appear to decorate basement-cover contacts in many cases. P-T conditions calculated from previously published data for both relict (Proterozoic lithospheric mantle?) porphyroclast assemblages and Scandian (subduction-related?) neoblastic assemblages do not define such a clear field gradient, but probably record a combination of their pre-orogenic P-T record with Scandian re-working during and after subduction entrainment. A crude linear array in the P-T plane defined by peridotite samples may be, in part, an artifact of errors in the geobarometric methods. A spatial association of mantle-derived peridotites with the UHP terrane and with basement-cover contacts is consistent with a hypothesis for entrainment of at least some of them as 'foreign' fragments into a crustal UHP terrane during subduction of the Baltic continental margin to depths of > 100 km, and encourages a more mobilistic view of the assembly of the WGC from its component lithotectonic elements.

A polymerase chain reaction-based differential screening strategy allowed for the isolation of an Atlantic salmon nucleoside diphosphate kinase cDNA (nm23). Structural characterisation showed a high degree of homology with a large number of previously isolated nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NM23s), both prokaryote and eukaryote, though it represents the first teleost nucleoside diphosphate kinase identified. Highest similarities were found with the type 1 and type 2 NM23 isoforms of mammals. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the duplication event that gave rise to these isoforms occurred after the splitting of tetrapods and fish, suggesting that the salmon NM23 represents a more ancestral isoform. The position of the salmon sequence on the phylogenetic tree indicates that the salmon genome is expected to have at least three copies of genes from the nm23 gene family. Northern blot analysis showed a single transcript of approximately 0.7kb in both embryonic and adult tissues. Examination of the temporal pattern of expression of salmon nucleoside diphosphate kinase during embryonic development revealed that this gene is first expressed at the time of gastrulation. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases are thought to have a vital role in regulatory processes such as signal transduction, proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that nucleoside diphosphate kinases have an important role to play in early embryogenic development in vertebrates. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Archaeal histones and the eucaryal (eucaryotic) nucleosome core histones have almost identical histone folds. Here, we show that DNA molecules selectively incorporated by rHMfB (recombinant archaeal histone B from Methanothermus fervidus) into archaeal nucleosomes from a mixture of \u22431014 random sequence molecules contain sequence motifs shown previously to direct eucaryal nucleosome positioning. The dinucleotides GC, AA (=TT) and TA are repeated at \u224310 bp intervals, with the GC harmonic displaced \u22435 bp from the AA and TA harmonics [(GCN3AA or TA)(n)]. AT and CG were not strongly selected, indicating that TA \u2260 AT and GC \u2260 CG in terms of facilitating archaeal nucleosome assembly. The selected molecules have affinities for rHMfB ranging from \u22439 to 18-fold higher than the level of affinity of the starting population, and direct the positioned assembly of archaeal nucleosomes. Fourier-ransform analyses have revealed that AA dinucleotides are much enriched at \u224310.1 bp intervals, the helical repeat of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, in the genomes of Eucarya and the histone-containing Euryarchaeota, but not in the genomes of Bacteria and Crenarchaeota, procaryotes that do not have histones. Facilitating histone packaging of genomic DNA has apparently therefore imposed constraints on genome sequence evolution, and since archaeal histones have no structure in addition to the histone fold, these constraints must result predominantly from histone fold-DNA contacts. Based on the three-domain universal phylogeny, histones and histone-dependent genome sequence evolution most likely evolved after the bacterial-archaeal divergence but before the archaeal-eucaryal divergence, and were subsequently lost in the Crenarchaeota. However, with lateral gene transfer, the first histone fold could alternatively have evolved after the archaeal-eucaryal divergence, early in either the euryarchaeal or eucaryal lineages.

        "Absrtact": "Task-switching paradigms, in which subjects are typically asked to switch between different S-R mappings, can be considered operationalizations of executive control. Such paradigms are therefore potentially useful in investigating the neural bases of control functions. Here, we present the results of an fMRI study intended to examine two separable components of task-switching: preparation, and the residual shift cost identified by Rogers and Monsell [13]. In analyses restricted to functionally identified regions of interest, we found robust evidence of greater activity for switch trials, compared to repeat trials. This pattern was present both at the time of stimulus presentation and prior to the switch trial. In analyses of the entire brain, we were able to identify one area in the superior parietal lobule that was active during switching but was not part of the apparent network of task-related regions. We conclude that switch trials are neurally distinct from repeat trials in eliciting generally greater neural activity both before and during the performance of a trial.

Heritability coefficients were on average 0.40 for individual gaits under rider and 0.23-0.47 for jumping traits at SPTs. Repeatabilities between tests at 6-month intervals were 0.75-0.77 for gaits and 0.38-0.58 for jumping traits. The genetic correlation between the gaits ranged from 0.30 to 0.71. Positive genetic correlations were found between gaits under rider and jumping traits (0.14-0,54), thus breeding for both characteristics is facilitated. Free jumping results were highly correlated (0.93) to results in jumping under rider, and because of their higher heritability the former are Very suitable for selection purposes. Genetic correlation estimates between a trait in SPT and the same trait at 4-year-old offspring field test were unity for gaits under rider and jumping. The genetic correlations between gaits and jumping at the two different tests were 0.26-0.35. It was concluded that the field tests are well suited for early progeny testing of the stallions, and will improve the accuracy in selection of stallions for performance traits.

Field significance was assessed using a bootstrap methodology to account for the observed regional cross-correlation of streamflows. Using a 5% significance level, we found no evidence of trends in flood flows but did find evidence of upward trends in low flows at the larger scale in the Midwest and at the smaller scale in the Ohio, the north central and the upper Midwest regions. A dramatically different interpretation would have been achieved if regional cross-correlation had been ignored. In that case, statistically significant trends would have been found in all but two of the low flow analyses and in two-thirds of the flood flow analyses. We show that the cross-correlation of flow records dramatically reduces the effective number of samples available for trend assessment. We also found that low flow time series exhibit significant temporal persistence. Even when the serial correlation was removed from the time series, significant trends in low flow series were apparent, though the number of significant trends decreased. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Growth of many bubbles is monitored in every experiment. Bubble growth rate increases with temperature and initial total H 2 O. At a given temperature and initial total H 2 O, bubble growth rate also increases slightly with bubble size. The average growth rate for bubbles growing in an infinite rhyolitic melt at a bubble radius of 25 \u03bcm is at 600\u00b0C and 2.0 wt% H 2 O(t,i). Our data show that bubble growth is controlled by both viscous flow and diffusion, with viscous flow playing a dominant role at the initial stage. We used the numerical bubble growth model of Proussevitch and Sahagian [J. Geophys. Res. 103 (1998) 18223-18251] to calculate bubble growth rate. Using recently assessed solubility, diffusivity, and viscosity models, the bubble growth model can reproduce our experimental data to within a factor of about 2. Adjusting the viscosity model by a factor of up to 5 (within the stated 2\u03c3 uncertainty of a factor of 8.3) generates almost perfect fits to our data. (Adjusting other parameters within uncertainty does not help significantly.) Other recent bubble growth data, except those at 0.1 MPa and 375-460\u00b0C with 5.0 wt% initial H 2 O, are also consistent with the calculation. This is the first experimental verification of a bubble growth model in a silicate melt. We suggest that the verified model can be applied with confidence to quantify bubble growth during volcanic eruptions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Several countries within the EU have successfully eradicated bovine herpesvirus type I (BHV1), while others are still making efforts to eradicate the virus. Reintroduction of the virus into BHV1-free areas can lead to major outbreaks - thereby causing severe economic losses. To give decision-makers more insight into the risk and economic consequences of BHV1 reintroduction and into the effectiveness of various control strategies, we developed the simulation model InterIBR. InterIBR is a dynamic model that takes into account risk and uncertainty and the geographic location of individual farms. Simulation of a BHV1-outbreak in the Netherlands starts with introduction of the virus on a predefined farm type, after which both within-farm and between-farm transmission are simulated. Monitoring and control measures are implemented to simulate detection of the infection and subsequent control. Economic consequences included in this study are related to losses due to infection and costs of control. In the simulated basic control strategy, dairy farms are monitored by monthly bulk-milk tests and miscellaneous farms are monitored by half-yearly serological tests. After detection, movement-control measures apply, animal contacts are traced and neighbour farms are put on surveillance. Given current assumptions on transmission dynamics, we conclude that a strategy with either rapid removal or vaccination of infected cattle does not reduce the number of infected farms compared to this basic strategy - but will cost more to control. Farm type with first introduction of BHV1 has a considerable impact on the expected number of secondarily infected farms and total costs. To limit the number of infected farms and total costs due to outbreaks, we suggest intensifying the monitoring program on farms with a high frequency of cattle trade, and monthly bulk-milk testing on dairy farms.

This ESRA model is described and analysed with the main objective of being used to estimate solar radiation at ground level from satellite images with the Heliosat method. Therefore it is compared to clear-sky models that have already been used in the Heliosat method. The diffuse clear-sky irradiation estimated by this ESRA model and by other models has been also checked against ground measurements, for different ranges of the Linke turbidity factor and solar elevation. The results show that the ESRA model is the best one with respect to robustness and accuracy. The r.m.s. error in the estimation of the hourly diffuse irradiation ranges from 11 Wh m-2 to 35 Wh m-2 for diffuse irradiation up to 250 Wh m-2. The good results obtained with such a model are due to the fact that it takes into account the Linke turbidity factor and the elevation of the site, two factors that influence the incoming solar radiation. In return, it implies the knowledge of these factors at each pixel of the satellite image for the application of the Heliosat method. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Records of both Rayleigh and Love waves have been analyzed to determine the pattern of anisotropy in the Australasian region. The approach is based on a two-stage inversion. Starting from a smooth PREM model with transverse isotropy about a vertical symmetry axis, the first step is an inversion of the waveforms of surface waves to produce path specific one-dimensional (1-D) upper mantle models. Under the assumption that the I-D models represent averages along the paths, the results from 1584 Love and Rayleigh wave seismograms are combined in a tomographic inversion to provide a representation of three-dimensional structure for wavespeed heterogeneities and anisotropy. Polarization anisotropy with SH faster than SV is retrieved in the upper 200-250 km of the mantle for most of Precambrian Australia. In this depth interval, significant lateral variations in the level of polarization anisotropy are present. Locally, the anisotropy can be large, reaching an extreme value of 9% that is difficult to reconcile with current mineralogical models. However, the discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of strong lateral heterogeneities along the path, or by effects introduced by the simplifying assumption of transverse isotropy for each path. The consistency between the location of polarization and azimuthal anisotropy in depth suggests that both observations share a common origin. The observation of polarization anisotropy down to at least 200 km supports a two-layered anisotropic model as constrained by the azimuthal anisotropy of SV waves. In the upper layer, 150 km thick, anisotropy would be related to past deformation frozen in the lithosphere while in the lower layer, anisotropy would reflect present day deformation due to plate motion. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "This work explores the dissolution behavior of residual tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in chemically heterogeneous soils. A numerical solute transport simulator, that incorporates rate-limited dissolution and desorption using linear driving force expressions, was developed and applied to analyze soil column dissolution data and to conduct numerical dissolution experiments. Published mass transfer coefficients were unable to accurately predict the observed dissolution of entrapped PCE in fractional wettability porous media (media containing both water- and PCE-wet solid surfaces). A two-parameter power function expression for the lumped mass transfer coefficient was developed and successfully fit to these data. Correlations were then developed for the fitted mass transfer model parameters as a function of wettability and grain size distribution characteristics. The power function model, in conjunction with the parameter correlations, yielded reasonable predictions for long-term dissolution behavior in the more PCE- wetting media. Poorer predictions for the more water-wet materials were attributed to an increased sensitivity of effluent concentration behavior to temporal changes in PCE saturation in these systems. Many of the effluent concentration curves exhibited low and persistent concentration tailing after recovery of the separate phase PCE. This tailing behavior could be adequately modeled by incorporation of rate-limited desorption. Results from numerical experiments indicate that both the magnitude and spatial distribution of wettability can significantly influence PCE dissolution behavior and remediation time.

We have applied the method to partially rigid, C-and D-ring modified lignan natural product derivatives related to podophyllotoxin, and the biological activities of these as measured against HT29, P388 and A549 cell lines. The modified CoMFA produces more robust regressions than 'standard' CoMFA. The results of the modified CoMFA appear reliable enough to suggest that at least some of these compounds act through more than one mechanism, and that the importance of each mechanism appears to depend on the cell line used.

During this period, the volcano exhibited a pattern of cyclic inflation and deflation with an 8-14 h period. We find that SO2 emission rates, measured by COSPEC, correlate with the amplitude of these tilt cycles, and that higher rates of SO2 emission were associated with stronger ground deformation and enhanced hybrid seismicity. Within tilt cycles, degassing peaks coincide with maximum deformation gradients. Increases in the amount of gas in the magma conduit feeding the dome, probably due to increases in volatile content of ascending magma volume can account for the observed increases in tilt amplitude, hybrid seismicity and SO2 emission rate.

Comparison of phylogenetic trees based on 16S rDNA sequences with those based on narH sequences revealed highly similar relationships of both genes from most of the bacteria analysed.

        "Absrtact": "In April and May 1996, a geophysical study of the Cascadia continental margin off Oregon and Washington was carried out aboard the German RV Sonne as a cooperative experiment between GEOMAR, the USGS and COAS. Offshore central Oregon, which is the subject of this study, the experiment involved the collection of wide-angle refraction and reflection data along three profiles across the continental margin using ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and hydrophones (OBH) as well as land recorders. Two-dimensional modelling of the travel times provides a detailed velocity structure beneath these profiles. The subducting oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca plate can be traced from the trench to its position some 10 km landward of the coastline. At the coastline, the Moho has a depth of 30 km. The dip of the plate changes from 1.5\u00b0 westward of the trench to about 6.5\u00b0 below the accretionary complex and to about 16\u00b0 further eastward below the coast. The backstop forming western edge of the Siletz terrane, an oceanic plateau that was accreted to North America about 50 Ma ago, is well defined by the observations. It is located about 60 km to the east of the deformation front and has a seaward dip of 40\u00b0. At its seaward edge, the base of the Siletz terrane seems to be in contact with the subducting oceanic crust implying that sediments are unlikely to be subducted to greater depths. The upper oceanic crust is thinner to the east of this contact than to the west. At depths greater than 18 km, the top of the oceanic crust is the origin of pre-critical reflections observable in several land recordings and in the data of one ocean bottom instrument. These reflections are most likely caused by fluids that are released from the oceanic crust by metamorphic facies transition. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Crop and system performance were examined over a 4.5-year-period (nine growing seasons) commencing in October 1991; failure of the rains caused the loss of one cropping season. A rotation of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) and maize (Zea mays L.) was grown during the first five seasons after planting the trees, while maize was grown continuously during the final four seasons. Sole maize was also grown under spectrally neutral shade netting which reduced incident radiation by 25, 50 or 75% to establish the relative importance of shade and below-ground competition for water and nutrients in determining the performance of understorey crops. The above-ground biomass and grain yield of understorey crops were not significantly affected by the presence of grevillea during the first four seasons, but were greatly reduced in subsequent seasons as the trees became increasingly dominant; maize yields reached 50% of the sole crop values only once during the final four seasons, when rainfall was unusually high. The hypothesis that competition for water was the primary limiting factor for understorey crops was supported by the observation that above-ground biomass and grain yield were greater in the shade net treatments than in agroforestry maize, demonstrating that shade was not solely responsible for the substantial yield losses in the latter treatment. Performance ratios (ratio of values for the agroforestry system relative to sole stands) for total above-ground and trunk biomass in grevillea were initially low, reflecting the impact of competition with associated crops during tree establishment, but increased to unity within 2.5 years. Performance ratios for the understorey crops exhibited the reverse trend, initially being close to unity but approaching zero for three of the final four seasons. Performance ratios were never close to unity for both trees and crops during the same season, indicating that there was always competition for available resources irrespective of crop species or tree size. The implications for agroforestry system design and future research are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Invasion of natural ecosystems by weeds is often associated with increasing levels of disturbance. However, there is substantial evidence that cessation of disturbance can also lead to plant invasions, especially of woody species. In some coastal grasslands in south-eastern Australia, removal of grazing and burning appears to have triggered invasion by the indigenous shrub, Acacia sophorae. To quantify the impacts of such invasions on plant diversity, this study focussed on the coastal grasslands in Eurobodalla National Park, NSW. Analysis of aerial photographs indicated that 96 ha of the 479 ha study area (20%) was invaded by Acacia between 1944 and 1994, with the most rapid expansion from the late 1970s when grazing was removed. Vegetation sampling demonstrated a strong negative correlation between Acacia cover and plant species richness. A linear regression between the species richness of each quadrat and the number of growth rings on the largest Acacia branch showed an average loss of 7.5 species (38% of species) after 10 years of Acacia invasion and 15 species (76%) after 20 years. Long-term invasion favoured just a small group of shade tolerant, rhizomic grasses and sedges. Without active ecosystem management, grassland plant diversity should continue to decline and the nationally threatened herb, Thesium australe, is likely to disappear. An adaptive management program should be implemented promptly to assess the effects of different management regimes on Acacia abundance and plant diversity at ENP. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The core also provides a high-resolution record of geomagnetic paleointensity, that is consistent with, but at higher temporal resolution than previous Labrador Sea records. Correlation to the Greenland Summit ice cores (GRIP/GISP2) is achieved by assuming that Labrador Sea detrital layers correspond to cold stadials in the ice cores. This allows a GISP2 official chronology to be placed on MD95-2024 which is consistent with the inverse correlation between paleointensity and the flux of cosmogenic isotopes (10Be and 36Cl) in Greenland ice cores. Synchronous millennial scale variability observed from the MD95-2024 paleointensity record and a North Atlantic paleointensity stack (NAPIS-75) [C. Laj et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Ser. A 358 (2000) 1009-1025], independently placed on the GISP2 official chronology [C. Kissel et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 171 (1999) 489-502], further support the sediment to ice core correlation. High-resolution paleointensity and oxygen isotope records from the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, Somali Basin, sub-Antarctic South Atlantic and the relative flux of 10Be in Vostok (Antarctic) ice core are used to derive a common chronostratigraphy that neither violates the regional (millennial) or global (orbital) scale environmental stratigraphics. The resulting correlation circuit places the ice core and marine records on a common GISP2 official chronology, which indicates discrepancies as high as 5 kyr between the GISP2 and SPECMAP time scales. It further demonstrates that LIS instabilities in the Hudson Strait area are synchronous with cooling in the Greenland Summit ice cores and warming in the sub-Antarctic South Atlantic and in the Vostok ice core. Geomagnetic field intensity shows common global variance at millennial time scales which, in view of the out-of-phase interhemispheric climate variability, cannot be attributed to climatic contamination of the paleointensity records.

The spatial approach proposed in this study incorporates two novel aspects concerning the derivation of soil data feeding the simulation and the modelling of the crop production process. First, the soil parameters required for crop modelling as well as their imprecision were estimated from the qualitative information of a 1:250,000 scale regional soil database by a possibility theory approach, which combines a set of GIS procedures and a constraint satisfaction solver. Second, the initial process-based crop model was made less complex by deriving simple agrotransfer functions from simulations at representative sites located in the studied region. The resulting system estimated the yield expressed as possibility distributions over the region which can be visualised through decision maps. The proposed spatial approach was tested on a hard wheat yield (Triticum durum spp.) estimation in the Herault-Orb-Libron valley region (Languedoc, France). It proved to provide realistic yet imprecise estimates compared with those obtained for a set of site-crop estimates. The spatial approach allowed the identification of areas in which soil data needed to be improved for obtaining both reliable and informative estimates. These results demonstrated the potential usefulness of the proposed approach for providing reliable soil information for decision making at the regional level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The South Pennines, an area of acid-sensitive geology at the centre of a major industrial region, have undergone perhaps the most severe historic exposure to sulphur and nitrogen deposition in the UK. This study addresses a lack of existing research on the region by presenting the findings of a survey of 62 surface waters sampled during a 1-week period in April 1998. Results indicate that acidification in the region is acute; 27 of the sampled surface waters had a negative acid neutralising capacity (ANC) and 28 had a pH below 5.0. Minimum recorded pH values were below 4.0. Non-marine sulphate levels were extremely high (median 222 \u03bceq/1), and widespread high nitrate concentrations (median 41 \u03bceq/1) suggest that soils in the region as a whole may be at an advanced stage of nitrogen saturation. A consistent relationship was identified between site acidity and the balance between the major weathering-derived cations, calcium and magnesium, and sulphate. This could in turn be linked to catchment soil type and land use, with the most acidic conditions occurring in peat-dominated catchments, where weathering is minimal and the influence of atmospheric deposition most pronounced. Percentage of peat in each catchment was the single best predictor of surface water acidity. Nitrate concentrations, although not a dominant control on acidity, varied significantly according to land use. Elevated concentrations were observed in catchments containing forestry, due to enhanced deposition inputs, and in catchments containing improved land, linked to fertiliser use. Ammonium concentrations, although low at most catchments, were a significant component of the inorganic nitrogen total in a number of surface waters draining waterlogged peat catchments.

Rising trends in pH were identified at seven of the eight reservoirs, generally accompanied by declining aluminium levels. Nitrate concentrations have, however, increased sharply at the two reservoirs for which adequate data were available. Data for a wider range of determinands at the Etherow suggest that pH increases in the region can be attributed to declining sulphate concentrations, as a result of reductions in sulphur deposition. Nitrate concentrations have again increased at this site. Results are significant in a national context in that pH recovery, although widely believed to have taken place in the UK since the 1970s, has rarely been shown to have occurred. For the South Pennine region, which has been severely acidified by historically high acid deposition levels, there have clearly been improvements over the last 18 years, although many surface waters remain acidic. Observed trends for nitrate suggest that some of the pH recovery resulting from reduced sulphur deposition may have been offset by nitrogen saturation in the region, due in part to continued high levels of nitrogen deposition.

In August 1997, April 1998, and September 1998 we recorded seismic and acoustic signals generated at two andesitic volcanoes with 'Strombolian-type' activity. Despite variations in explosion frequency (5-15 h-1 at Karymsky as opposed to 1-3 h-1 at Sangay), the signatures of the explosions are remarkably similar at these two, diverse field sites. In all explosions, gas emission begins rapidly and is correlated with an impulsive acoustic pressure pulse. Seismic waveforms are emergent and begin 1-2 s before the explosion. We classify explosion events at the two volcanoes as either short-duration (less than 1 min) simple impulses or long-duration (up to 5 min) tremor events. Many tremor events have harmonic frequency spectra and correspond to regular 1 s acoustic pulses, often audible, that sound like chugging from a locomotive. Chugging events are intermittent, suggesting that the geometry or geochemistry of the process is variable over short time scales. We attribute the 1 Hz periodic chugs to a resonant phenomenon in the upper section of the conduit. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are direction-specific acoustic filters formed by the head, the pinnae and the ear canals. They can be used to assess acoustical cues available for sound localization and to construct virtual auditory environments. We measured the HRTFs of three anesthetized Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 591 locations in the frontal hemisphere ranging from -90\u00b0(left) to 90\u00b0(right) in azimuth and -60\u00b0(down) to 90\u00b0(up) in elevation for frequencies between 0.5 and 15 kHz. Acoustic validation of the HRTFs shows good agreement between free field and virtual sound sources. Monaural spectra exhibit deep notches at frequencies above 9 kHz, providing putative cues for elevation discrimination. Interaural level differences (ILDs) and interaural time differences (ITDs) generally vary monotonically with azimuth between 0.5 and 8 kHz, suggesting that these two cues can be used to discriminate azimuthal position. Comparison with published subsets of HRTFs from squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) shows good agreement. Comparison with published human HRTFs from the frontal hemisphere demonstrates overall similarity in the patterns of ILD and ITD, suggesting that the Rhesus monkey is a good acoustic model for these two sound localization cues in humans. Finally, the measured ITDs in the horizontal plane agree well between -40\u00b0and 40\u00b0in azimuth with those calculated from a spherical head model with a radius of 52 mm, one-half the interaural distance of the monkey.

        "Absrtact": "A mathematical model is presented that simulates the annually averaged transport of radionuclides, originating from the BNFL reprocessing plant at Sellafield, throughout the Irish Sea. The model, CUMBRIA77, represents the processes of radionuclide transport and dispersion in the marine environment and allows predictions of radionuclide concentration in various environmental media, including biota, to be made throughout the whole of the Irish Sea. In this paper we describe the use of the model to reconstruct the historical activity concentrations of 137Cs and 239+240Pu in a variety of environmental media in the western Irish Sea and along the Irish east coast back to 1950. This reconstruction exercise is of interest because only limited measurements of 137Cs and 239+240Pu activity are available prior to the 1980s. The predictions were compared to the available measured data to validate their accuracy. The results of the reconstruction indicate that activity concentrations of 137Cs in the western Irish Sea follow a similar, though slightly delayed and smoothed, profile to the discharges from the Sellafield site, with concentrations at the time of peak discharge (the mid-1970s) being around an order of magnitude higher than those measured in the 1980s and 1990s. By contrast, the concentrations of 239+240Pu at the time of peak discharges were similar to those presently measured. These differences reflect the distinct marine chemistries of the two nuclides, in particular the higher propensity of plutonium to bind to sediments leading to extended transport times. Despite these differences in behaviour the doses to Irish seafood consumers from 137Cs remain significantly higher than those from 239+240Pu. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

FMSI: a FORTRAN program for inverting fault/slickenside and earthquake focal mechanism data to obtain the regional stress tensor. Comput. Geosci. 16, 953-989) to fault plane solutions of 298 small earthquakes (2.5<M(d)<4.8) recorded by the National seismic network of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica in the period 1988-1995. First, we verified that the stress inversion procedure, generally applied to a large number of focal mechanisms of earthquakes recorded in a local seismic network, could be successfully used in Italy, using background seismicity recorded over large (~ 100-200 km) regions. Then, comparing the stress inversion results with other stress indicators, we find that they are geologically sound for many regions in Italy, even if the misfit values are relatively large. We also find that the largest misfit values are determined by a few earthquakes (only 10-20% of the total number). Excluding these earthquakes from inversion, the average misfit becomes much lower (by ~ 30-40%). The results obtained in this study confirm the large variations of the stress field over a relatively short distance in Italy, but also confirm the existence of regions extending for a few hundred kilometres within which the stress is homogeneous. Among these, most of the Apennines are dominated by extension perpendicular to the trend of the mountain belt. Only in the northern Apennines is there any clear distinction between an area of extension in the inner portion of the belt and an area under horizontal compression along the Adriatic margin of the belt. More rapid variations occur around Calabria and Sicily, as expected because of the complexities linked with the Tyrrhenian subduction and with active volcanism. In the Ionian Calabrian coastal region, there are hints of active NW-SE compression, although constrained by a few data, whereas in the Messina Strait, we observe ~ E-W extension and a vertical \u03c31. In northern and western Sicily, our results indicate N-S to NW-SE compression, roughly consistent with the general convergence between the European and the African plates.

        "Absrtact": "Any change in climate will have implications for climate-sensitive systems such as agriculture, forestry, and some other natural resources. With respect to agriculture, changes in solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation will produce changes in crop yields, crop mix, cropping systems, scheduling of field operations, grain moisture content at harvest, and hence, on the economics of agriculture including changes in farm profitability. Such issues are addressed for 10 representative agricultural areas across the midwestern Great Lakes region, a five-state area including Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This region is one of the most productive and important agricultural regions in the world, with over 61% of the land use devoted to agriculture. Individual crop growth processes are affected differently by climate change. A seasonal rise in temperature will increase the developmental rate of the crop, resulting in an earlier harvest. Heat stress may result in negative effects on crop production. Conversely, increased rainfall in drier areas may allow the photosynthetic rate of the crop to increase, resulting in higher yields. Properly validated crop simulation models can be used to combine the environmental effects on crop physiological processes and to evaluate the consequences of such influences. With existing hybrids, an overall pattern of decreasing crop production under scenarios of climate change was found, due primarily to intense heat during the main growth period. However, the results changed with the hybrid of maize (Zea mays L.) being grown and the specific location in the study region. In general, crops grown in sites in northern states had increased yields under climate change, with those grown in sites in the southern states of the region having decreased yields under climate change. Yields from long-season maize increased significantly in the northern part of the study region under future climate change. Across the study region, long-season maize performed most successfully under future climate scenarios compared to current yields, followed by medium-season and then short-season varieties. This analysis highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to changed environmental conditions. In addition, scenarios of increased climate variability produced diverse yields on a year-to-year basis and had increased risk of a low yield. Results indicate that potential future adaptations to climate change for maize yields would require either increased tolerance of maximum summer temperatures in existing maize varieties or a change in the maize varieties grown.

It has been argued that animals in general might perform Levy flight motion with power law distribution of times between successive changes of the direction of motion. Here we study the temporal behaviour of nesting gilts. The time spent by a gilt in a given form of activity has a power law probability distribution without a finite average. Further analysis reveals intermittent occurrence of certain periodic behavioural sequences which are responsible for the scaling behaviour and indicates the existence of a critical state. This is in close analogy with temporal sequences of velocity found in turbulent flows, where random and regular sequences alternate and form an intermittent sequence. The source of this complex behaviour can come only from the neural system forced by hormonal stimulus due to nesting instincts. This is the first carefully examined case, where complex scaling behaviour of animals is related to the self-organization and possibly to some unstable critical state of the nervous system.",

        "Absrtact": "Thermal imaging from satellites is one methodology used for the monitoring and scientific investigation of volcanoes, including those characterised by active lava domes. To be most effective, the remote sensing techniques employed must allow the cause of any observed thermal anomaly to be identified, ideally using information contained within the remote sensing data itself, whilst using any ancillary field data to guide analysis and the necessary assumptions. This study investigates a method by which such discrimination maybe accomplished for activity at lava domes. For this purpose we use three Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of Unzen Volcano (Japan) to determine the temperature structure of the active lava dome existing during 1991-1993. These data are of particularly high quality since the TM scenes were obtained during night-time overpasses and a large amount of supplementary data are available to parameterise the model used to retrieve the subpixel temperature structure of the dome surface. The results are matched to near-contemporaneous geological sketch maps of the then current situation in order to identify the TM pixel groupings corresponding to the different styles of dome activity, namely fumarolic degassing, exogenous and endogenous dome growth, and collapse deposits resulting from block and ash flows, small scale pyroclastic flows and rockfalls. The spatial and statistical characteristics of the resultant TM-derived temperature distributions are then investigated to determine rule-based criteria that may be used to differentiate the activity styles of lava domes based on their thermal structure within the remote sensing data. Results indicate that fumarolically active locations, regions of active dome growth, and areas of collapse deposition on the Unzen dome can be differentiated using only the statistical distribution of the hotspot temperatures and fractional areas identified via analysis of TM imagery. The statistics derived for hotspots at the fumarolically active areas show them to be, in general, significantly hotter (and smaller) than those found at the areas of active dome growth, whereas hotspots retrieved on the areas of collapse deposition are cooler (and larger). We find that the frequency distributions of hotspot temperatures extracted for the areas of endogenous and exogenous dome growth exhibit statistically inseparable means, but that discrimination between these two dome growth styles is possible using analysis of the spatial arrangement of the retrieved hotspots. Specifically the exogenous lobes are characterised by structures interpreted to be the effusing vent of new magma and the collapsing lobe front. These features are absent at locations showing only endogenous growth. It is hoped that the criteria developed here will prove useful during future quantitative analysis of the extended TM time-series available for Unzen, and for identification of thermal anomalies of uncertain origin at other active domes observed via satellite remote sensing. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Data about the stratigraphical and regional distribution of Cretaceous rudist bivalves in the central-eastern Mediterranean and Middle East from the Barremian to the Maastrichtian have been compiled in a taxonomic databank system. The investigated region comprises northern, central and southern regions of the Cretaceous Tethys. The regionally different quality of taxonomic data is critically discussed. Both species richness and abundance (number of species records) peak in the Early Aptian, Late Cenomanian and Early Campanian. Temporal patterns in species richness are examined in relation to evolutionary innovations of the group. Crises in species richness and abundance during the Early and mid-Cretaceous were coeval with oceanic anoxia associated with platform drowning. Also, regional emergence affected large parts of the Apulian Plate and other central Tethyan carbonate platforms during the mid-Cretaceous period of globally high sea level, so that these crises can be attributed to regional environmental perturbations, induced by either oceanic anoxia or tectonic movements. The Cenomanian-Turonian transition marks an important faunal turnover, as indicated by the demise of taxonomic groups which are characterised by recumbent ecological morphotypes and predominantly aragonitic shells. During the Turonian, they were replaced by associations of largely calcitic Radiolitidae and Hippuritidae, among which elevator morphotypes dominated. The stratigraphy of many post-Turonian deposits in the studied region is too imprecise for a detailed analysis of Late Cretaceous distributional patterns, and the demise of rudists during the Maastrichtian in particular. The regional pattern of species richness and abundance is similar throughout most of the investigated region. A notable exception is the broad north-eastern African shelf from Libya to Lebanon, where rudists were almost completely absent after the Coniacian. This coincided with shallow-water phosphorite and black-shale formation on the extended shelf of this region, indicating the upwelling of nutrient-rich waters and stagnant conditions. During this time (Campanian-Maastrichtian), species-rich associations thrived along the north-eastern Afro-Arabian margin, now exposed in south-eastern Turkey, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. This region forms the single distinct faunal province during the Cretaceous in the studied region, as indicated by an endemism of 40% at the genus level. The low species richness and abundance of Hippuritidae on Turonian-Maastrichtian central Tethyan carbonate platforms, when compared with regions having mixed calcareous-siliciclastic sedimentation, is interpreted to argue against a widespread photosymbiosis in the group. Several aspects of this study highlight the importance of regional tectonic and oceanographic controls of distributional, and perhaps also evolutionary, patterns of rudist bivalves. Their delineation still suffers from the regionally different quality of stratigraphical and taxonomic data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

However, studies evaluating whether polymorphic variation in tau is associated with AD have produced conflicting results.

        "Absrtact": "This paper describes an audio delivery system model called Kendra. We focus on Kendra's adaptive delivery processes and the experimentation carried out to analyze it. The system trades off quality of sound against periods of silence; therefore, adaptation changes the format of the audio data to save bandwidth when bandwidth becomes more scarce. Typically adaptive systems are composed of a monitoring component and a switching component. The Kendra monitoring component has predictive capabilities, which advise the switching component to adapt either to a better quality or to a more bandwidth friendly format when it detects lower bandwidth. The prediction element can vary the amount of data it uses in its prediction, trading-off accuracy with the system's impedance on the performance. Such systems exhibit many other tradeoffs that determine how sensitive and/or optimistic the system is to its environment, and this is explored in our experimentation. We conclude our work by discussing these network conditions and tradeoffs and how they affect the performance of the system.",

        "Absrtact": "Recent research in landscape ecology has sought to define the underlying structure of landscape pattern as quantified by landscape pattern metrics. One method used by researchers to address this question involves statistical data reduction techniques. In this study, principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on 27 landscape pattern metrics derived from a Kansas land cover data base at three spatial resolutions: 30 m, 100 m, and 1 km. A hexagonal sampling grid was used to subset the landscape and FRAGSTATS software was used to calculate landscape pattern metrics. The PCA reduced the number of variables from 27 to 5. A five-component PCA solution explained between 81 and 89% of the variation in the data set. The components were interpreted as overall landscape texture, patch shape and size, cropland and grassland class-specific metrics, patch interspersion, and a nearest neighbor attribute. These five dimensions Were identified at each resolution level. The first component was stable throughout the resolution levels, whereas the Order of importance changed for the latter four components. That most components consistently appeared at each resolution level supports the use of the same subset of pattern metrics for landscape monitoring in the region at different resolutions. The individual metrics emerging as most important were similar to those noted in other research and include the modified Simpson's diversity index, the area-weighted mean patch fractal dimension, the interspersion and juxtaposition index, and the largest patch index for grasslands.

We show that these parameters have remained close to the present day values over the last 25 million years. The best fitting astronomical solution we obtained gives rise to a value of 0.9999 times the current day dynamical ellipticity, and 1.004 times the current day tidal dissipation value as used in the algorithm of Laskar (1993). Our range of uncertainty is 0.9996-1.0001 for the dynamical ellipticity of the Earth and 0.945-1.025 for the tidal dissipation. Our model does not require changes in these parameters over the last 25 Ma and we show that using the solution of Laskar (1993) with present day values for dynamical ellipticity and tidal dissipation as a tuning target does not introduce large errors during astronomical tuning. Our results indicate that the Earth has not crossed into resonance with Saturn and Jupiter during the last few million years. Our conclusions depend on the assumption of a correct initial tuning of the ODP Leg 154 data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Mutations in certain MADS-box genes are known to cause homeotic alterations in floral organ identity, and the establishment of floral organ identity is the most well-studied developmental process in which MADS-box genes are known to function. Our interest is in the potential connection between the duplication history of this gene family and the evolutionary origin of the structures that the different MADS-box genes developmentally regulate in plants. Previous studies have demonstrated that the origin of the MADS-box genes that control floral organ identity predate the evolutionary origin of the flower itself, since gymnosperms have genes that are orthologous to angiosperm floral homeotic MADS-box genes, whereas ferns appear to lack such genes. Here we report on the isolation of a MADS-box gene from Lycopodium annotinum, which belongs to the clubmosses, the phylogenetic sister group to other vascular plants. The gene, LAMB1, in the sporophyte is expressed exclusively in the reproductive structure, the strobilus, during sporogenesis. LAMB1 is similar to other plant MADS-box genes in that it contains a MADS-box as well as a second conserved element, a K-box. However, it differs in length and in exon/intron structure in the region between the MADS- and K-box, and also in the length and structure of the C-terminal region. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that LAMB1 is not closely related to other plant-type MADS-box genes, and may represent one of the basal branches in the phylogenetic tree of plant MADS-box genes.

This paper briefly reviews new and existing technologies in the areas of data collection methods with some emphasis on remote sensing methods. An example for a conceptual data base management system adapted by the US Department of Agriculture is presented as a framework for the acquisition, maintenance and distribution of climate and agrometeorological data for the 21st century. The access of data to the national and international community can be resolved with the standardization of data base management and electronic accessibility. Databases in the US have been upgraded for access through the World Wide Web, and include data archived from other countries that have co-operative programs with US institutions. The operational needs of national agricultural producers, researchers, and agricultural weather and crop forecasters are the focus of this paper although it also serves some of the needs of the international research community.

Both sites show strong geochemical and geologic evidences of hydrothermal activity. The geophysical methods consist of two microgravimetric surveys, two 2D geoelectric profiles, a seismic reflection profile and a five seismic refraction profiles. The seismic methods allowed us to locate the main subsurface seismic discontinuities and to evaluate their geometrical relationships. The gravity field was used to constraint the seismic discontinuities, while the electric prospecting let discriminate more conductive areas, which could correspond to an increase in thermal fluid circulation in the investigated sites. The results obtained by the different geophysical methods are in good agreement and permit the definition of a reliable geostructural model of the subsurface setting of the two investigated areas. A low-enthalpy geothermal reservoir constituted by a permeable pyroclastic and lava sequence underlying two shallow impermeable formations was found at Fossa del Fuardo. The reservoir is intersected by some sub-vertical faults/fractures that probably play an important role in convoying the thermal water up to the surface. At the other site, Terme di S. Calogero, the geophysical surveys showed that an intense circulation of fluids affects the subsurface of the area. This circulation concentrates along a ENE-trending fault located at a little distance from the thermal resort. The hot fluids may upraise along the fault if the width of the ascent area is smaller than 20 m. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

For this purpose, a broad version of multidimensional symmetry is introduced, namely \"halfspace symmetry\", generalizing the well-known notions of \"central\" and \"angular\" symmetry. Characterizations of these symmetry notions are established, permitting their properties and interrelations to be illuminated. The particular location measures considered consist of several nonparametric notions of multidimensional median: The \"L2\" (or \"spatial\"), \"Tukey/Donoho halfspace\", \"projection\", and \"Liu simplicial\" medians, all of which are robust in the sense of nonzero breakdown point. It is established that the first three of these in general do identify the point of symmetry when it exists, whereas the latter, however, fails to do so in some circumstances. Combining this finding with consideration of other criteria such as affine equivariance, stochastic order preserving, and degree of robustness, we conclude that among these choices, the \"halfspace\" and \"projection\" medians, both of which are based on projection pursuit methodology, are the most attractive overall. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",

However, robotics travel routing should be based on a relative coordinate to obtain a better solution because the robotics, board and magazine are simultaneously moved at different speeds during assembly. To resolve such a dynamically combinatorial problem, this study presents the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Tabu Search (TS) based algorithms.

First, the necessity of standardization, to make comparisons between world cities' relations credible, is advanced. Secondly, three different measurement methodologies (of increasing power, but with specific functions) are advanced (surrogate, labour and organizational), and illustrated through three pieces of research, to specify a world city's external relations. Thirdly, both practical ways of organizing research to obtain relational data, and a World Wide Web initiative designed to store and make available data across the globe, are outlined.

        "Absrtact": "This paper is devoted to a new approach to the problem of estimating the free core nutation (FCN) parameters from tidal gravity data. We first review different models of the FCN resonance parameters (period, damping, strength), as well as different inversion techniques used in gravimetry (analytical, linearised least squares, non-linear generalised inverse, stochastic). We propose then a new Bayesian inversion method since such a probabilistic view allows the most complete and reliable information on the FCN resonance to be obtained. We show the consequences of introducing the positivity of the quality factor Q and, even more important, we show that the null information criterion on this factor allows us to better understand why Q is often underestimated in gravity studies (or even found to be negative) with standard least squares techniques. We apply the Bayesian estimation method to a set of gravity data originating from a 3000-day record (1988-1996) of the superconducting gravimeter (SG T005) near Strasbourg (France), after correction for pressure effects and ocean loading with the help of a recent model derived from satellite altimetry. The marginal distribution found for the eigenperiod is nearly Gaussian and leads to a most probable value of 428 days, in agreement with previous gravity studies. The Q distribution is found to be highly asymmetrical with a flat maximum probability that Q exceeds 105, in agreement with the high values derived from very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) studies. The joint probability laws of the parameters show that strong correlations exist between some couples of parameters. Finally, the important impact of inaccurate ocean loading corrections on the determination of the damping of the eigenmode is pointed out; it appears that wrong ocean corrections may lead to underestimation of Q or, even worse, to generation of negative Q when using standard least squares retrieval techniques applied to gravity data.",

        "Absrtact": "Plant communities (ground and field layer species) within a wide range of coniferous forest stands across Britain were classified using the National Vegetation Classification, and community composition and diversity related to stand structure and site characteristics. Data were collected from 12 plantation forest sites, encompassing a range of climatic conditions (uplands, foothills, and lowlands), crop types (Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Corsican pine), and crop ages (pre-thicket, mid-rotation, mature and over-mature). Vegetation communities in lowland sites were poorly correlated with semi-natural woodland analogues, with 'goodness-of-fit' coefficients less than 40%. The highest coefficients were obtained for mature and over-mature pine and spruce stands in the uplands and foothills climatic zones. These stands were matched most closely to semi-natural pinewoods and oakwood communities. Principal components analysis produced four summary soil vectors and four habitat structure vectors, that described 84 and 79% of the variability in the site and stand structure data, respectively. These vectors were related to plant community composition, species richness and diversity using canonical correspondence analysis and correlation analysis. Variation in community composition was related principally to a soil fertility gradient, defined by increasing pH, exchangeable Ca, and available N in NO3- form, coupled with decreases in soil organic matter and N in NH4+ form. Vascular plant and bryophyte species diversity was inversely related to available N. Uplands and foothills Scots pine and Sitka spruce sites had plant communities typical of acid, infertile soils, whereas lowland Norway spruce sites had communities associated with high soil fertility. Plant community composition and diversity was also significantly related to measures of vertical stand structure. Pre-thicket plots, with high values for field layer vertical cover; had distinctive communities and were more diverse than mid-rotation and mature plots; which had high canopy cover values, and low shrub and field layer cover. A positive relationship was recorded between deadwood volume and bryophyte species diversity, with over-mature Sitka spruce stands in the uplands having particularly high volumes of deadwood due to windthrow. This influence of stand structure suggests that plant community diversity can be enhanced in commercial conifer forests by extending rotation lengths, introducing alternative silvicultural systems such as shelterwood, and increasing deadwood volumes.

A limitation of this rule is basically the number of parameters of the one-fluid EoS considered, which cannot exceed 2 or 3.By integrating an improved Teja corresponding states EoS (T), which requires the same individual parameters as a cubic equation, in a gE-EoS mixing rule framework, a new technique is obtained with two modes, one correlative and one predictive.In the correlative mode, the liquid phase \u03b3 is generated from input VLE data using the improved T model and the historical Wong-Sandler-Teja mixing rules for the pseudocritical functions, except for Tcmix. In the predictive mode, the same general procedure is followed, but with the liquid phase \u03b3 coming from a UNIFAC gLE model, which makes the mixing rule predictive.The Tcmix values are locally generated from these new rules and are correlated as an individual function, which in both cases presents a very smooth trend for the systems studied. The two proposed rules are applied to systems of halogenated alkanes, which are known to be polar and deviating, and are compared with the dedicated EoS available for these mixtures. The results for both modes show an interesting level of accuracy in representing the whole thermodynamic behaviour of a mixture. Copyright \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "We have used wide-angle seismic data to constrain the internal structure of Tenerife, Canary Islands. The experiment was designed as a seismic fan profile to detect azimuthal variations in the seismic structure of the volcanic edifice and its flanks. Seismic energy was generated using a 75-1 airgun-array on board the RRS Charles Darwin fired every 40 s along a quasi-circular profile around the island of Tenerife, centered on Teide volcano. We present the results obtained from the data recorded by five portable land stations distributed on the island. The travel-times indicate that the averaged P-wave velocity within the volcanic edifice is greater than 6 km/s. The observed travel-times were reduced to residual travel-times by removing the effects of variations in the bathymetry along the profile, variations in the shot-receiver distance, and from local heterogeneities. Negative residual travel-times up to 0.8 s in amplitude indicate that the southwestern part of Tenerife is characterized by a high P-wave velocity zone, coincident with a gravity maximum that was previously modeled as a high-density body forming the core of an old, large mafic volcano. We estimate velocities greater than 7.3 km/s within the anomalous body, suggesting that it represents an intrusive plutonic complex. This high-velocity, high-density body may have played an important role in the evolution of Tenerife, buttressing Las Ca\u00f1adas edifice and preventing the occurrence of landslides in the southern and western areas of Tenerife. The bathymetric high between Tenerife and La Gomera is associated with travel-time delays up to 0.4 s, suggesting that it may be composed of large deposits of lava flows and volcaniclastic materials, probably erupted from the shield massifs of Teno, Roque del Conde, and La Gomera. The post-shield volcanic zones of Santiago and Dorsal rifts also seem to be characterized by moderate high P-wave velocities. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.",

We considered Rayleigh waves from available records of all events which occurred during years 1991-1995, with latitude lower than 40\u00b0S and magnitude M \u2265 5.0. We performed classic single-station dispersion analysis on the surface wave train to measure group velocity of the Rayleigh fundamental mode in the period range between 30 and 120 s. We iteratively applied two different techniques of filter analysis: a multiple-filter [Dziewonski et al.. 1969] and a phase-matched filter algorithm [Herrin, and Goforth. 1977]. We used such dispersion measurements to compute two-dimensional maps of velocity anomalies in the region. We parameterized group velocity with linear splines, and inverted the linear system by means of singular value decomposition. Results are in significant agreement with earlier studies, but reach a considerably higher detail. Our model differentiates well among geologically different regions, such as the old East Antarctica craton, the accreted terranes of West Antarctica, and the oceanic lithosphere surrounded by the ring of mid-ocean ridges. We image slow areas corresponding to hot-spot regions, including a broad anomaly corresponding to recent volcanism in the Ross Sea, where the existence of a mantle plume has been proposed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Samples of both surface and subsurface soils were collected on various surfaces in three badland areas of differing ages (Tabernas, Vera and Mocatan), in Almeria province, southern Spain. Data were explored with the aim of identifying any diagnostic geochemical relationships between site EC, pH, sediment size and SAR, which might constitute typical 'signatures' for site materials, with some success. Data for the three sites are further used to explore the hypothesis that changes in site geochemistry through time are involved in badland stabilisation. It was found that: (1) the physico-chemical properties of the three sites can be differentiated by the functional relationship between EC and SAR, and this may represent a useful tool in characterising sites where piping predominates; (2) there is some (equivocal) evidence that sediment size distribution may play an additional role in site diagnosis and evolution; and (3) surfaces appear to lose sodium over time, the suggestion being that sodium is either progressively buffered by calcium during leaching, or exchanges with hydrogen on the cation exchange sites under a vegetation cover. Since other research suggests that smectite can also relocate down the profile on some marl sites, reducing hydraulic conductivity and suppressing pipes, we argue that the surface at Tabernas may be capable of long-term autostabilisation in which piping intensity progressively reduces. However, this possibility really applies only to fine-grained, densely structured materials, and evidence from the silty Triassic-rich unit in the Mocatan basin suggests that without a high clay content, piping may be expected to increase through time. From this standpoint, contemporary badland morphology at Mocatan does not represent an early stage of the forms seen in Vera and Tabernas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we discuss the philosophy of design, functional modules and application areas of POND, a decision tool that has been developed to allow analysis of pond aquaculture facilities by the use of a combination of simulation models and enterprise budgeting. We focus less on the details of POND's internal models, and more on the experiences we have gained from going through the process of the designing, developing and using the POND software. POND was designed and implemented using object-oriented programming principles. The software makes use of a simulation framework to provide much of the generic simulation, data handling, time flow synchronization and communication features necessary for complex model-based DSSs. Additionally, an architecture suitable for representing and manipulating pond aquaculture facilities was developed in order to meet the design specifications of POND. This architecture includes a series of mini-databases, a number of knowledge-based components ('experts'), models of the pond ecosystem, and various decision support features (e.g. assembling alternate management scenarios, economic analysis, and data visualization). A typical POND simulation consists of assembling a number of appropriate objects or entities (e.g. multiple ponds and fish lots), their management settings together with appropriate experts (e.g. an aquaculture engineer, an aquatic biologist, an economist, etc.), and projecting changes in the facility over time. Our experience with the development of POND and other simulation-based tools indicates that the object-based approach provides a robust foundation for developing tools which allow code reusability, facilitate maintenance of complex software, and enable partition of program development among multiple programmers. Experience gained with POND users suggests that there are largely two groups of aquaculture personnel interested in such applications, namely commercial growers and educators. These two groups have substantially different interests and needs. Consequently, a single tool such as POND may not optimally meet the requirements of both groups. Recent development work on POND, and the need to involve users in the design process of such tools are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Episodes of enhanced ice rafted detritus (IRD) input were accompanied by discrete temperature minima, representing coolings of between 4 and 8\u00b0C, and reductions in surface salinity of up to 2.5-3.5\u2030. Several additional cooling episodes of a similar magnitude were documented during intervals of low IRD input that appear to be synchronous, within the limits of dating, with ice rafting events spatially confined to higher latitudes. Accelerator mass spectrometer 14C dates for Heinrich events (HI - 14.2 ka, H2 - 21.4 ka, H3 - 26.7 ka, H4 - 34.8 ka, H5 - 47.2 ka) obtained from core SU90-03 agree well with other published age estimates and suggest a contemporaneous pattern of climate change throughout the North Atlantic during the last glacial period. This interpretation is supported by a comparison of IRD and palaeotemperature records from DSDP site 609 and core SU90-03, which clearly shows that the major climatic fluctuations identified at high latitudes were transmitted toward the subtropics. However, 14C dates suggest that ice rafting episodes may be diachronous to some extent. The northward migration of the polar front after the H1 event at 40\u00b0N in the mid-Atlantic occurred at 14 ka, approximately 500 years earlier than along the Portuguese margin, where the southerly advection of polar waters persisted within eastern boundary current system.

The observed changes in the \u03b413C record provide a useful tool for high-resolution stratigraphic correlation, and are used here to create a composite Cenomanian-Turonian \u03b413C curve in a time-related framework. A best fit curve to 673 carbon isotope data is provided using the LOWESS regression scatterplot smoother. The long-term trend of the smoothed composite \u03b413C profile varies on time scales of 106 years, and shows stable \u03b413C values through the Lower Cenomanian, an increase in the Middle and Upper Cenomanian, with a major positive excursion around the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary, and a decrease through the Lower and Middle Turonian. Short-term fluctuations vary on time scales of 105 years, and dominated the \u03b413C signal in the higher Middle and Upper Turonian. Changes of the Cenomanian-Turonian \u03b413C record have commonly been explained by variations in the organic carbon flux to the sedimentary reservoir, in response to eustatic sea-level change. However, mass balance consideration suggests also an influence of carbonate production and burial rate on the \u03b413C signal. Enhanced inorganic carbon burial increased the ratio of the inorganic to organic carbon fluxes and shifted the 13C/12C ratio to more negative values. This pattern may be observed in the Early and Middle Turonian \u03b413C long-term record, and correlates with the spatial expansion of pelagic carbonate deposits in epicontinental seas. Short-term \u03b413C variations could be either a directly response to short-term sea-level changes, reflecting local conditions in the European epicontinental sea, or could represent changes in oceanic 12C storage in response to the varying intensity of thermohaline circulation.

        "Absrtact": "The length distribution of normal faults and grabens in the Valles Marineris region of Mars reveals the importance of fault linkage on fault-length data sets. Fault-length data for the normal-fault segments produce a continuously curving distribution on a cumulative-length vs. frequency plot, assuming that the faults all slip independently, with an approximate slope of -2 for lengths 30 < L < 200 km. When the Martian fault lengths are modified to account for their interaction and linkage, a more shallowly sloping (approximately -1) distribution is produced for fault lengths 30 < L < 300 km, reflecting the greater importance of large linked faults in accommodating the regional strains. Incremental-frequency and R-plots of fault lengths demonstrate variations in fault density with linkage and the importance of considering grabens as single structures. Unlike some terrestrial earthquake data, the Martian fault population does not reveal persuasive evidence for a small-to-large fault transition associated with lithospheric thickness or rheology, or with long-term strain. However, the decoupling of maximum fault displacement and length over the full range of the data is consistent with the dependence of displacement-size scaling on fault segment aspect ratio, rather than on the total fault length. The important inverse dependence of population power-law exponent and natural inhomogeneous fault strain, obtained previously from terrestrial fault sets and fault-growth simulations, is supported by using this Martian fault array.

The new age data allow a precise chronological framework to be established for the pre-evaporitic sequence of Melilla basin demonstrating that diatomitic deposits are coeval with both prograding bioclastic and reefal units. The prograding bioclastic carbonate unit related to boreal influences in coeval basinal diatomites, began at least at 6.73 \u00b1 0.02 Ma and ended at 6.46 \u00b1 0.03 Ma. The oligospecific prograding Porites coral-reefs and Halimeda beds and coeval warm-water diatomites began at least at 6.46 \u00b1 0.03 Ma. Previous 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages indicate that they ended prior to 6.0 \u00b1 0.1 Ma. Both biosedimentological similarities and chronological accordance within several platforms and adjacent basins all around the Alboran Sea show that these main bioevents, dated in Melilla, are synchronous over the Alboran realm. This accurate time scale for these pre-evaporitic biosedimentary events (6.9-6.0 Ma) is in accordance with the most recent work on the latter period corresponding to the Messinian Salinity Crisis.

        "Absrtact": "The New Jersey passive continental margin records the interaction of sequences and sea-level, although previous studies linking seismically defined sequences, borehole control, and global \u03b418O records were hindered by a seismic data gap on the inner-shelf. We describe new seismic data from the innermost New Jersey shelf that tie offshore seismic stratigraphy directly to onshore boreholes. These data link the onshore boreholes to existing seismic grids across the outer margin and to boreholes on the continental slope. Surfaces defined by age; facies, and log signature in the onshore boreholes at the base of sequences Kw2b, Kw2a, Kw1c, and Kw0 are now tied to seismic sequence boundaries m5s, m5.2s, m5.4s, and m6s, respectively, defined beneath the inner shelf. Sequence boundaries recognized in onshore boreholes and inner shelf seismic profiles apparently correlate with reflections m5, m5.2, m5.4, and m6, respectively, that were dated at slope boreholes during ODP Leg 150. We now recognize an additional sequence boundary beneath the shelf that we name m5.5s and correlate to the base of the onshore sequence Kw1b. The new seismic data image prograding Oligocene clinoforms beneath the inner shelf, consistent with the results from onshore boreholes. A land-based seismic profile crossing the Island Beach borehole reveals reflector geometries that we tie to Lower Miocene litho- and bio-facies in this borehole. These land-based seismic profiles image well-defined sequence boundaries, onlap and downlap truncations that correlate to Transgressive Systems Tracts (TST) and Highstand Systems Tracts (HST) identified in boreholes. Preliminary analysis of CH0698 data continues these system tract delineations across the inner shelf The CH0698 seismic profiles tie seismically defined sequence boundaries with sequences identified by lithiologic and paleontologic criteria. Both can now be related to global \u03b418O increases and attendant glacioeustatic lowerings. This integration of core, log, and seismic character of mid-Tertiary sediments across the width of the New Jersey margin is a major step in the long-standing effort to evaluate the impact of glaciouestasy on siliciclastic sediments of a passive continental margin.

The activity concentrations of 134Cs and 137Cs in soil samples from 16 sites distributed in a grid pattern over the investigated area have been measured and the depositions from the nuclear weapons tests and from the Chernobyl accident have been separated. These pre- and post-Chernobyl activities have been compared with depositions calculated from measurements of the activity concentrations of 134Cs and 137Cs in precipitation at two places and from measurements of the precipitation from a network of between 113 and 143 precipitation stations. Comparisons with in situ measurements and with aerial survey measurements have also been made. The agreement is good gain and it has been possible to gain a good and detailed knowledge in retrospect of the deposition from measurements of the deposition per mm of precipitation from just a few stations, and of the precipitation from a network of stations.

Simulated annealing is applied for solving this reconfiguration problem. The supply network is comprised of distribution centers that are geographically distributed and have differing operating and maintenance cost structures on distribution-related resources. The distribution planning methodology employed in the heuristics has two phases: Phase one incorporates a strategic-based decision making step in which the `best' set of distribution centers are selected open; Phase two incorporates an operationally-based decision making step in which the heuristics perturb the customer assignments and resource assignments. The heuristics are tested on a set of 450 problems of various sizes and structures. Computational results suggest that the simulated annealing heuristics generate near optimal solutions quickly and are well suited for evaluating supply network reconfiguration. Computational results also suggest that enhanced annealing heuristics proposed in this paper are better than the standard annealing approach. The supply network problem structure was exploited to achieve very good solution results.",

We hypothesize the existence of two separate markets for top management in state-owned and comparable publicly traded firms from 1970 to 1981 and the subsequent merging of these markets after privatization from 1982 to 1994. Consistent with our hypotheses, we document that prior to privatization, top management in state-owned enterprises received half the compensation of their publicly traded counterparts, and the determinants of the level of pay were more bureaucratic: there was no pay for performance, little variation across executives and firms, and systematic age-related pay increases. After privatization, we find a convergence in the level of executive compensation, the intensity of pay for performance, and the variation and determinants of pay across executives and firms.

Muriwai is a high-energy meso-tidal beach characterised by modal breaker wave heights of 2.5 m and incident wave periods of 10-15 s. The monitored rip system was characterised by a 400 m long, 75 m wide longshore feeder channel and a 150 m wide rip-neck channel oriented obliquely to the shore and extending over a distance of almost 400 m. During the experiment, the beach evolved from a longshore bar-trough and rip state to a transverse bar and rip configuration. Mean eulerian flow velocities obtained from ducted flowmeters deployed on the margin of the feeder channel and rip-neck were on the order of 1 m s-1 and instantaneous flows were commonly in excess of 2 m s-1. Mean lagrangian surface flow velocities extending from the base of the feeder through to the rip-head were obtained by tracking rip floaters and were on the order of 0.7 m s-1, with maximums in the rip-neck region of 1.4 m s-1. A distinct tidal modulation of rip current flow existed with maximum velocities occurring at low tide and minimum velocities at high tide. Comparison with other rip studies suggests that although the magnitude of the morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes occurring within large-scale rip systems is extreme, the behaviour of these rip systems is very similar to low-energy rips with much smaller spatial scales. There is evidence to suggest that distinct morphodynamic scaling relationships exist between these environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The abundance of nematodes, the species and trophic types present, as well as their distribution in relation to plant community and soil characteristics are analyzed and discussed. The abundance of nematodes from the 36 grasslands studied ranged between 0.41 x 106 and 8.57 x 106 individuals/m2, and a total of 121 genera and 145 species of nematodes were found. The highest diversity was found in grasslands developed on brown earth soil (65-67 genera and 74-76 species), with least diversity in those evolving on podzol and lithosol (33-36 genera with 25-28 identified species). Most of the dominant taxa were found in specific soil layers; some obligate plant parasitic genera (e.g., Paratylenchus, Rotylenchus, Criconema) showed preference for deeper soil layers. The nematode diversity index (H'), with values ranging between 2.38 and 3.47, did not differ significantly between the different types of grasslands. Plant feeding, bacterial feeding, hyphal feeding and omnivorous nematodes were the main groups in mountainous grasslands developed on different soil types. Plant feeding and bacterial feeding nematodes dominated the trophic structure and more plant feeders (62-69%) were found in communities of subalpine and alpine grasslands developed on podzol and alpine meadow soil, than in those developed on rendzina and lithosol (27-33%). The ratio of hyphal feeding to bacterial feeding nematodes (Hf/Bf) is constantly in favour of the bacterial feeding group, the values being an indicator of good soil fertility for most studied grasslands. The nematode communities of grasslands are grouped into six main clusters according to their genera affinity and distinguished by different grassland and soil types. Communities from subalpine grasslands developed on rendzina, acid brown and lithosol have the greatest similarities. An ordination of nematode communities in relation to important environmental variables is presented. Environmental variables relevant in explaining the patterns of nematode composition in grasslands, using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), are: humus, pH, total nitrogen, exchangeable bases and soil type. No single factor could be selected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The two-blade model was operated at tip speed ratios in the range \u03bb = 3.8, and chord Reynolds numbers Re = 6400-16000. The blades were untwisted, with flat-plate aerofoil profile. Measurements of wake velocity and vorticity were obtained for a two-dimensional flow field representing an axial cross-section of the wake, extending 2.9 rotor diameters downstream of the rotor. The vorticity maps were compared with calculations made using the Rotor Vortex Lattice Method (ROVLM), an inviscid free-wake code recently developed at the University of Stuttgart. The PIV and ROVLM data show qualitative agreement in terms of the shape of the wake boundary, including downstream wake contraction, and quantitative agreement in terms of the tip vortex pitch. It appears that the fundamental behaviour of the helical vortex wake may be relatively insensitive to blade chord Reynolds number, so long as similarity of tip speed ratio is observed. An experimental investigation into the properties of the vortex wake behind a wind turbine rotor has been carried out at model scale, using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The two-blade model was operated at tip speed ratios in the range \u03bb = 3-8, and chord Reynolds numbers Re = 6400-16000. The blades were untwisted, with flat-plate aerofoil profile. Measurements of wake velocity and vorticity were obtained for a two-dimensional flow field representing an axial cross-section of the wake, extending 2.9 rotor diameters downstream of the rotor.

The objective of this study was to describe ambulatory visits and practices of CNMs, and compare them with those of obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/ GYNs). Sources of population-based data used to compare characteristics of provider visits were three national surveys of CNMs and two National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys of physicians. When a subset of 4,305 visits to CNMs in 1991 and 1992 were compared to 5,473 visits to OB/GYNs in similar office-based ambulatory care settings in 1989 and 1990, it was found that a larger proportion of CNM visits were made by women who were publicly insured and below age 25. The majority of visits to CNMs were for maternity care; the majority of visits to OB/GYNs were for gynecologic and/or family planning concerns. Face-to-face visit time was longer for CNMs, and involved more client education or counseling. This population-based comparison suggests that CNMs and OB/GYNs provide ambulatory care for women with diverse demographic characteristics and differing clinical service needs. Enhancing collaborative practice could improve health care access for women, which would be especially beneficial for those who are underserved and vulnerable.

The results may be summed up as follows: (i) GC-poor genes, that did not undergo the compositional transition, showed only minor differences in orthologous sets from Xenopus, human and chicken; this is remarkable in view of the very many nucleotide substitutions that occurred over the long evolutionary times separating these species; (ii) GC-rich genes, that underwent the compositional transition, showed large differences between Xenopus and warm-blooded vertebrates, but not between chicken and human. In other words, the independent changes that occurred in avian and mammalian genes, on the average, were the same. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In non-central collisions, the K- and K+ rapidity distributions are broader than expected for a single thermal source. In this case, the polar angle distributions are strongly forward-backward peaked and the nonisotropic contribution to the total yield is about one third both for K+ and K- mesons. The K-/K+ ratio is found to be about 0.03 independent of the centrality of the reaction. This value is significantly larger than predicted by microscopic transport calculations if in-Medium modifications of K mesons are neglected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The recordings, from four soil and one rock stations, represent 23 earthquakes (ML 4.9-7.0): PGA varies between 20-260 cm/s2. For each station, mean HVSR curves are calculated for two PGA ranges: <75 cm/s2 and >100 cm/s2 (weak and strong motion). At the soil station, the \"weak\" (linear) and \"strong\" (nonlinear) responses are significantly different. Below 1-1.8 Hz, the nonlinear response exceeds the linear one. Above 2 Hz, the nonlinear response drops below the linear one and above 4-6 Hz below unity (deamplification). From 10 to 16 Hz, the two responses converge. One soil site shows significant negative correlation between resonance frequency and ground acceleration. Such behaviour agrees with other empirical studies and theoretical predictions. Our results imply that the HVSR technique is sensitive to ground-motion intensity and can be used to detect and study nonlinear site response. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Historical time-series of recruitment to plaice stocks around the United Kingdom were examined for evidence of synchrony. Correlations were significant for most pair-wise comparisons and a meta-analysis test over all the stocks was highly significant. Previous studies on plaice recruitment in the North Sea have suggested that a negative relationship exists between sea temperature, during the first few months of the year, and subsequent year-class strength. When we examined the correlations between sea surface temperature and plaice recruitment, we found statistically significant negative relationships for most areas. These were strongest for the period February-June. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the temperature effect on recruitment of North Sea plaice is due to changes in predation pressure on the planktonic stages. However, western (North Sea and Channel) and eastern (Irish Sea and Celtic Sea) stocks appeared to respond to different time-scales of temperature variability which may imply that different mechanisms could be operating in these stocks. Management of plaice is based upon projections of future stock dynamics. Compared with fisheries on some other species, those on plaice are less dependent on the in-coming year-class. Therefore, the incorporation of sea temperature data into plaice stock dynamic models will probably not have a large impact on short-term projections. However, incorporation of a temperature relationship will allow medium to long-term forecasts to be made under varying environmental scenarios. These may provide a more realistic range of projections of future stock trends than is currently achieved. Crown Copyright \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The presence of erosive canyons on high latitude passive margins is unusual. Such margins are more normally dominated by subsidence and glacially influenced deposition. However, ten canyons are identified at the edge of the narrow shelf on the North Norwegian margin off the Lofoten Islands, between the Traenadjupet and Andoya slides, on the basis of GLORIA long-range side-scan sonar and contemporaneous 3.5 kHz profiler data, combined with a detailed bathymetry. The canyons are located down-stream of sediments transported through the Lofoten Drift, and the margin is characterized by an absence of cross-shelf troughs. Canyons are up to 420 m deep, U-shaped, display steep gradients in their upper parts, and sediments derived from them have short runout distances onto the continental rise. The canyons are estimated to be 20-30 Ma old, being incised into only thinly covered, lithified, pre-Miocene sediments as a response to Cenozoic uplift. Late Quaternary sedimentation processes associated with the canyons are inferred to occur during both glacials and interglacials. Glacial sedimentation is probably in the form of direct subglacial-debris input, in addition to turbid subglacial meltwater plumes. Interglacial sedimentation processes are probably dominated by the along-shelf transport of sediments by strong ocean currents; canyon heads 'capture' sediment from the shelf. The remobilization of this coarse material and erosion of the canyons occurs through debris flows and turbidity currents. Canyon preservation and continued development can be attributed directly to the comparatively low sedimentation rates during full-glacial conditions, as ice streams, located to the north and south, produce regional depocentres away from this area of relatively slow-flowing ice.

The one is a correlative concept which is characterized by all the advantages and disadvantages of statistical regression methods. It is strongly dependent on data quality.

MRA using MW, \u03b1 and \u03b2 is unsatisfactory because of collinearity amongst predictors. The best predictor was the product MW*charge.

The mean total bird density in the secondary forest (44.5 ha-1) was much higher than in the plantation (12.4 ha-1). The Great Tit Parus major, Light-vented Bulbul Pycnonotus chinensis and Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonica were the three most abundant species at both the sites but their mean annual densities were all much higher in the secondary forest. There were relatively more granivores and insectivores and fewer insectivore-frugivores in the plantation. Twelve species were confirmed breeding in the secondary forest and none in the plantation.

We use the papers published from the 4-m, and papers published from the non-queue WIYN time as controls, requiring only that the data be obtained after 1996 August 1, at which time the WIYN queue was in its third full semester of operation, and the WIYN instruments functional and stable. The number of papers published from the queue data is actually 1.5 times smaller (on a per night basis) than from the 4-m, and roughly comparable to (but lower than) the number published from non-queue WIYN time. Thus neither comparison offers any support for the hypothesis that queue leads to a higher scientific throughput. The number of papers is relatively small, but the statistics are sufficiently robust to reject the possibility that queue observing at WIYN leads to a factor of 1.5 enhancement in publication rate with a 99.3% confidence in comparison to the 4-m, and with an 89.9% confidence in comparison with non-queue WIYN time. We consider several explanations, and urge that other observatories planning to employ the queue mode include some controls to provide an objective evaluation of its success. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

However, an individual's speech signal does not exhibit, even over a long time, the entire range of characteristics of the population. With the advent of personal communication systems, personal information might become available and hence may be exploited to improve the rate-distortion performance of speech coders. In this paper, we experimentally assess the potential gain of personal speech coding by designing codebooks for individual speakers. Experiments are performed using linear prediction based analysis-by-synthesis (LPAS) speech coders. The spectral envelope, excitation, and pitch lag quantization codebooks of LPAS coders are redesigned. The gains appear to be modest, suggesting the need to use a coding framework that models personal characteristics more explicitly, e.g. by using prosodic features. Amongst the coder components, the spectral quantizer is found to be most amenable to personalization.",

Geothermobarometric evaluation for matrix assemblages reveals peak metamorphic condition between 14 and 21 kbar at 500 to 600\u00b0C. Prograde growth zoning and mineral inclusions in garnet are evidence for a clockwise P-T path. The presence of intimate eclogite/metabasic blueschist interlayering and the high P-T estimates suggest that the eclogite-facies rocks from the southern Tianshan high-pressure belt formed in a tectonic regime similar to the Franciscan type.

        "Absrtact": "Orogenic gold deposits are a widespread coherent group of epigenetic ore deposits that are sited in accretionary or collisional orogens. They formed over a large crustal-depth range from deep-seated low-salinity H2O-CO2 + CH4 + N2 ore fluids and with Au transported as thio-complexes. Regional structures provide the main control on deposit distribution. In many terranes, first-order faults or shear zones appear to have controlled regional fluid flow, with greatest ore-fluid fluxes in, and adjacent to, lower-order faults, shear zones and/or large folds. Highly competent and/or chemically reactive rocks are the most common hosts to the larger deposits. Focusing of supralithostatic ore fluids into dilatant zones appears to occur late during the evolutionary history of the host terranes, normally within D3 or D4 in a D1-D4 deformation sequence. Reactivation of suitably oriented pre-existing structures during a change in far-field stress orientation is a factor common to many deposits, and repeated reactivation may account for multiple mineralization episodes in some larger deposits. Absolute robust ages of mineralization support their late-kinematic timing, and, in general, suggest that deposits formed diachronously towards the end of the 100 to 200 m.y. long evolutionary history of hosting orogens. For example, in the Yilgarn Block, a region specifically emphasised in this study, orogenic gold deposits formed in the time interval between 40 and 90 m.y., with most about 60 to 70 m.y., after the youngest widespread basic-ultrabasic volcanism and towards the end of felsic magmatism. The late timing of orogenic gold deposits is pivotal to geologically-based exploration methodologies. This is because the present structural geometries of: (i) the deposits, (ii) the hosting goldfields, and (iii) the enclosing terranes are all essentially similar to those during gold mineralization, at least in their relative position to each other. Thus, interpretation of geological maps and cross-sections and three-dimensional models can be used to accurately simulate the physical conditions that existed at the time of ore deposition. It is particularly significant that the deposits are commonly related to repetitive and predictable geometries, such as structural heterogeneities within or adjacent to first-order structures, around rigid granitoid bodies, or in specific \"locked-up\" fold-thrust structures. Importantly, the two giant greenstone-hosted goldfields, Kalgoorlie and Timmins, show a remarkably similar geometry at the regional scale. Computer-based stress mapping and GIS-based prospectivity mapping are two computer-based quantitative methodologies that can utilize and take advantage of the late timing aspect of this deposit type to provide important geological aids in exploration, both in broad regions and more localized goldfields. Both require an accurate and consistent solid geology map, stress mapping requires knowledge of the far-field stresses during mineralization, and the empirical prospectivity mapping requires data from a significant number of known deposits in the terrane. The Kalgoorlie Terrane, in the Yilgarn Block, meets these criteria, and illustrates the potential of these methodologies in the exploration for orogenic gold deposits. Low minimum stress anomalies, interpreted to represent dilational zones during gold-related deformation, coincide well with the positions of known goldfields rather than individual gold deposits in the terrane, and there are additional as-yet unexplained anomalies. The prospectivity analysis confirms that predictable and repetitive factors controlling the siting of deposits are: (i) proximity to, and orientation and curvature of, granitoid-greenstone contacts, (ii) proximity to segments of crustal faults which strike in a preferred direction, (iii) proximity to specific lithological contacts which have similar preferred strike, (iv) proximity to anticlinal structures, and (v) the presence of preferred reactive host rocks (e.g., dolerite). The prospectivity map defines a series of anomalous areas, which broadly conform to those of the stress map (> 78% correspondence). The most prospective category on this map covers less than 0.3% of the greenstone belts and yet hosts 16% of the known deposits, which have produced > 80% of known gold. Thus, it discriminates in favour of the larger economically more-attractive deposits in the terrane. The successful application of stress mapping and prospectivity mapping to geology-based exploration for orogenic gold deposits indicates that more quantitative analysis of geological map data is a profitable line of research. The computer-based nature of these methodologies is ideal for the production of an ultimate, integrated, deposit target map, which can be compared to other, more conventional, targeting parameters such as geophysical and geochemical anomalies. Such an integrated strategy appears the way forward in the increasingly difficult task of cost-effective global exploration for orogenic gold deposits in poorly exposed terranes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The purpose of this study is deriving a 3D tomographic image of the shear-wave velocity structure of the lithosphere asthenosphere system of the Mediterranean region from Rayleigh wave fundamental mode dispersion data. The database consists of almost 200 wavetrains corresponding to regional events recorded at the MedNet very-broad-band stations placed in the Mediterranean area. On the basis of the path-averaged group velocities derived for each epicentre-station trajectory, local group velocities over the area covered by the seismic paths have been obtained for the 10-90s period range by means of Yanovskaya's formulation for laterally heterogeneous media. According to the resolution of these local velocities, a grid of 1\u00b0 of latitude per 1\u00b0 of longitude has been defined over the Mediterranean area and a local group velocity dispersion curve has been then assigned to each gridpoint. The stochastic inversion of almost 450 local dispersion curves permits deriving the respective ID shear-velocity structures, from which the elaboration of a 3D tomographic image of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system of the Mediterranean region is straightforward. As expected, taking into account the complexity of this area, the shear-velocity model reveals significant lateral changes in the crust and uppermost mantle elastic structure. As a main feature, low shear-velocities are deduced for most part of the central and eastern Mediterranean basin at shallow depths, down to 35-40 km. whereas significantly higher velocities are obtained for the basins of the western Mediterranean at this depth range. This velocity pattern suggests a thicker crust in the centraleastern part, with a greater thickness of sedimentary layers on account of the lower velocities deduced for the uppermost levels. On the contrary, for depths>80 km., low shear-velocities are obtained towards the west, while the highest shear-velocities are derived for the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Aegean Sea. Greece, the centre and the south of the Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea, Sicily and Tunisia. The velocity pattern at this depth range suggests a deeper beginning of the asthenosphere (varying between 100 and 150 km) under these areas, while a shallower top (around 70 km depth) is found beneath the western Mediterranean Sea. The areas where a thicker lithosphere has been deduced depict the main contact between the Eurasian and African plates, this feature being related to the collision and subduction processes linked to the convergence of both lithospheric plates. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Improved estimates of the variability in air-sea CO2 fluxes on seasonal and interannual time scales are necessary to help constrain the net partitioning of CO2 between the atmosphere, oceans and terrestrial biosphere. Few direct measurements of the carbon system have been made in the main Indian Ocean basin. In the mid 1990s, several global carbon measurement programs focused on the Indian Ocean, greatly increasing the existing carbon database for this basin. This study examines the combined surface CO2 measurements from three major US programs in the Indian Ocean: the global carbon survey cruises, conducted in conjunction with the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the NOAA Ocean-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange Study (OACES) Indian Ocean survey and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Arabian Sea Process Study. These data are fit with multiparameter linear regressions as a function of commonly measured hydrographic parameters. These fits are then used with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and Levitus 94 gridded values to evaluate the seasonal variability of surface seawater CO2 in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean and to estimate the magnitude of the Indian Ocean as a net sink for atmospheric CO2. The net annual flux for the Indian Ocean (north of 36\u00b0S) was - 12.4 \u00b1 0.5 x 1012 mol of carbon (equivalent to -0.15 Pg C) in 1995. The relatively small net flux results from the very different surface water pCO2 distributions and seasonal variations in the northern and southern Indian Ocean. The equatorial and northern hemisphere regions have values that are generally above atmospheric values. During the S-W monsoon, pCO2 values in the Arabian Sea coastal upwelling region are among the highest observed in the oceans. The upwelling is seasonal in nature, however, and only affects a relatively small area. The Indian Ocean equatorial region generally has values slightly above atmospheric. Unlike the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, however, no clear equatorial upwelling signature was observed in 1995. The Southern Hemisphere Indian Ocean, which represents the largest region by area, generally has values below atmospheric. The strongest undersaturations are observed in the austral winter, with summer values reaching near or slightly above atmospheric. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Nautile submersible investigations of mud volcanoes and brine seep areas of the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the MEDINAUT cruise in November 1998 discovered extensive areas of authigenic carbonate crusts associated with methane emissions. Carbonate crusts form pavements, round slabs and circular mounds on the central, most active parts of mud volcanoes and in a fault-related valley where brines have accumulated to form a submarine brine lake. Authigenic carbonate nodules have been recovered from the same areas during the MEDINETH cruise in July 1999. Large 13C depletions of authigenic calcite, aragonite and dolomite indicate methane as a major carbon source for the carbonate. Crust pavements are formed when methane from a freshly emplaced, methane-charged mud flow is oxidised at the seafloor. In this environment, where bottom waters provide the sulphate and magnesium, aragonite is favoured versus calcite and accounts for the majority of the methane-related authigenic carbonates. Calcite, when present, contains significant amounts of Mg2+ (high-Mg calcite), and possibly other divalent ions in its crystal lattice. In areas of brine seep and accumulation, dolomitic nodules are present at shallow depth in the sediment. The 18O enrichment of the authigenic carbonates (up to 4 \u2030 greater than calculated values for carbonates precipitating from modern eastern Mediterranean bottom waters) is interpreted as due to precipitation from 18O-rich fluids rather than as a temperature effect. The source of the 18O-rich fluids may be multiple and possibly includes the destabilisation of gas hydrates present at shallow subbottom depth, and the seepage of relic Messinian brines. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Sediment cores from two lakes in the outer coastal region of East Greenland were investigated for chronology, lithology, palynology, and biogeochemistry. A 10 m long sequence recovered in Basaltso comprises the entire lake history following the last glaciation of the area, probably during the Preboreal oscillation. This is indicated by a succession from glacial via glaciolimnic to limnic sediments. Deglaciation of the area was associated with a high sedimentation rate, mirrored also in the basal part of a 2.6 m long core from a smaller lake (BI) about 1 km south of Basaltso. Limnic sedimentation without glacial influence commenced about 10 000 cal. yr BP according to radiocarbon-dated terrestrial plant remains. Biogeochemical and palynological data indicate an earl Holocene climatic optimum from 9000 to 6500 cal. yr BP A climatic deterioration began at 6500 cal. yr BP with an increase in snow accumulation, documented by a change in the pollen assemblage and a coinciding change in the grain-size distribution. At least since 5000 cal. yr BP, a decrease in the biogeochemical parameters in both lake sediment successions indicates a temperature decline. This deterioration culminated at about 3000-1000 cal. yr BP, when the climate was cold and dry. A slight warming is indicated in the pollen assemblage between ca. 1000 and 800 cal. yr BP. Following a subsequent rise in precipitation, cooling during the Little Ice Age is mirrored in lowest dwarf shrub pollen percentages and in low contents of organic components.

We found that \u03b418O(mw) values decrease with increasing altitude for both transects. \u03b418O(mw) vs. altitude along the Kali Gandaki in west-central Nepal fit a second order polynomial curve, consistent with increasing depletion of 18O with increasing elevation, as predicted by a Rayleigh-type fractionation process. This modern \u03b418O(mw) vs. altitude relationship can be used to constrain paleoelevation from the \u03b418O values of Miocene-Pliocene carbonate (\u03b418O(c)) deposited in the Thakkhola graben in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Paleoelevations of 3800\u00b1480 m to 5900\u00b1350 are predicted for the older Tetang Formation and 4500\u00b1430 m to 6300\u00b1330 m for the younger Thakkhola Formation. These paleoelevation estimates suggest that by ~ 11 Ma the southern Tibetan Plateau was at a similar elevation to modern. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

In a recent survey study, Raupach et al. [Raupach, M.R., Finnigan, J.J., Brunet, Y., 1996. Bound.-Layer Meteorol. 78, 351-382] reviewed the current state of knowledge about air flow under ideal conditions (neutral to slightly unstable conditions, homogeneous and extensive canopy, flat terrain). This paper extends the knowledge by employing advances in our understanding of the flow in 'non-ideal' situations. The paper is divided into four topic areas: canopy flow under stable stratification, disturbed flow (forest edge, forest clearing, sparse canopy), canopy flow over complex terrain, and extreme wind events. Discussion of the latter two topics is of limited scope because of the scanty literature. A detailed account is given to the nighttime canopy wave phenomenon, broad patterns of the transitional flow across forest edges, and models of various complexities of the disturbed flows. Both observational and modeling aspects are discussed wherever possible. This synthesis study has identified a number of important questions in need of further research.

        "Absrtact": "Antarctic subglacial lakes were first identified by Robin et al. (1970) after airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) investigations of the ice-sheet interior. Recently, satellite altimetry was used to measure anomalous near-flat regions on the ice-sheet surface that represent a manifestation of the subglacial lake beneath. Using RES and satellite altimetry, the location and extent of Antarctic subglacial lakes can be identified. The largest subglacial lake exists beneath Vostok Station, and is 14,000 km2 in area. The combined area of additional subglacial lakes beneath Dome C is 15,000 km2 and at least 15,000 km2 of lake surface lies beneath the remainder of the ice sheet. The water depth of subglacial lakes can be estimated through seismic investigations (although data exist only for Lake Vostok) and consideration of the bedrock slopes that border subglacial lakes. The depths of many subglacial lakes are of the order of 10's-100's of metres. The total volume of water held beneath the ice sheet is estimated between 4000 and 12,000 km3. To date, there are six known examples of radio-echo reflections from the lake floors (at a depth of no more than 20 m). Since e/m attenuation through water is related to the salinity, these data indicate that subglacial water is very pure and fresh. Some near-flat surface regions that usually occur over lakes have been observed where no lakes exist. Such features are may be caused by water-saturated basal sediments rather than subglacial lakes. Finally, the spatial variation in geothermal heat flux around the central regions of Antarctica can be established estimated by employing a simple thermal model of the ice sheet under an assumption that the basal ice temperature above subglacial lakes is equal to the pressure melting value. Calculations indicate that the geothermal heat flux varies spatially over the Antarctic Plate between 37 and 65 mW m-2. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

A detailed description of the ForestGALES wind risk model is used to demonstrate the deterministic/probabilistic approach to risk assessment. The importance of quantitative risk estimation is illustrated by model output comparing a range of silvicultural strategies and site characteristics. The results illustrate how difficult it is to make general statements about risk and how management response has to be 'context sensitive'. Any response must be appropriate to the level of risk, the options for risk reduction and the implications of damage. Mathematical models provide an opportunity for objectively calculating the risks to forests and will in the future allow forest managers to make informed decisions about how best to manage forests in order to minimise these risks.

By viewing the interaction parameters as a matrix and performing a singular value decomposition, one arrives at the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model which is commonly used in agriculture. By using only those interaction components with the largest singular values, one can produce an estimate of interaction that requires far fewer than mn parameters while retaining most of the explanatory power of standard methods. The central inference problems of estimating the parameters and determining the number of interaction components has been difficult except in \"ideal\" situations (equal cell sizes, equal variance, etc.). The Bayesian methodology developed in this paper applies for unequal sample sizes and heteroscedastic data, and may be easily generalized to more complicated data structures.

        "Absrtact": "Since the early days of geochemical isotope ratio mass spectrometry there has always been the problem of cross contamination, i.e. the contamination of the sample gas with traces of reference gas (and vice versa) in a dual inlet system and the analyzer itself. This was attributable to valve leakages and could be corrected for. In modern leak-free machines this problem still influences the measurements by scale contraction. It limits the interlaboratory comparability to values unacceptable for, e.g. global carbon cycle investigations on atmospheric \u03b413CO2, with the need to integrate global datasets at a 0.01%, precision level. No matter what the reason of apparent cross contamination (physical leakage, low pump efficiency, gas-wall interactions), we present a method to measure the actual cross contamination as well as algorithms to correct for it. By using isotopically enriched sample gas the effect on the reference gas is directly shown. Especially for biomedical applications, employing highly enriched materials, the nonlinear correction has to be applied. A long-time record of two machines shows the influence of vacuum breakage and the inlet system setup. We present a survey of cross contamination in some of the frequently used machines. The relatively poor raw results of two recent interlaboratory comparison experiments are explained in terms of cross contamination. Whereas the linear two-point normalization procedure considered by itself may be appropriate for some routine applications at natural isotope abundances, it always relies on relative \u03b4 values of two reference materials. There is an urgent need to establish absolute values for all scale-determining reference materials. We recommend the use of cross contamination measurements to at least determine the isotopic composition of all normalization materials as long as absolute measurements are not available. In principle, the cross contamination measurements should be used as a diagnostic tool on a regular basis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Objective: To investigate delays in TB isolation and suspicion among HIV-infected inpatients discharged with TB or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), common HIV-related pneumonias. Design: Cohort study during 1995 to 1997. Setting: For PCP, 1,227 persons who received care at 44 New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles hospitals. For TB, 89 patients who received care at five Chicago hospitals. Measurements: Two-day rates of TB isolation/suspicion. Results: For HIV-related PCP, Los Angeles hospitals had the lowest 2-day rates of isolation/suspicion of TB (24.3%/26.6% vs 65.5%/66.4% for New York City and 62.8%/58.3% for Chicago, respectively; p < 0.001 for overall comparison by X2 test for each outcome measure). Within cities, hospital isolation/suspicion rates varied from < 35 to > 70% (p < 0.001 for interhospital comparisons in each city). The Chicago hospital with a nosocomial outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB from 1994 to 1995 isolated 60% of HIV-infected individuals who were discharged with a diagnosis of HIV- related TB and 52% discharged with HIV-related PCP, rates that were among the lowest of all Chicago hospitals in both data sets. Conclusion: Low 2-day rates of TB isolation/suspicion among HIV-related PCP patients were frequent. One Chicago hospital with low 2-day rates of TB isolation/suspicion among persons with HIV-related PCP also had low 2-day rates of isolation/suspicion among confirmed TB patients. Thai hospital experienced a nosocomial multidrug-resistant TB outbreak. Educational efforts on the benefits of early TB suspicion/isolation among HIV-infected pneumonia patients are needed.",

After initial elimination of tracer from the readily exchangeable calcium pools subsequent skeletal calcium turnover maintains and modulates the urine 41Ca content. Uniquely, bone calcium metabolism may then be studied with tracer in near equilibrium with the body's calcium and resorbing calcium directly measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of excreta. Our experiments with 25 41Ca labeled subjects demonstrate excellent diurnal stability and remarkable response to intervention of the urine signal. Thus the tracer method may prove a competitive means of measuring the effects of antiresorptive osteoporosis treatments, for therapy development or even clinical monitoring. Novel studies of long-term skeletal evolution are also possible. We realize that routinely administered short-lived calcium radiotracers contain 41Ca impurities and that thousands of experimental participants have been historically inadvertently 41Ca labeled. The 41Ca urine index might now rapidly further be characterized by contemporary measurements of these one-time subjects, and with their by now thoroughly skeleton-equilibrated tracer they might be ideal participants in other new experiments. We are also investigating 45Ca AMS. It may prove preferable to label the skeleton with this radiotracer already familiar to bioscientists, but new to AMS. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In contrast, the Sr displacement towards the SrO surface of 0.22\u00b10.07 angstrom is in good agreement with theory.",

        "Absrtact": "Foresters have always relied on a knowledge of chemical and physical properties of soils to assess capacity of sites to support productive forests. Recently, the need for assessing soil properties has expanded because of growing public interest in determining consequences of management practices on the quality of soil relative to sustainability of forest ecosystem functions in addition to plant productivity. The concept of soil quality includes assessment of soil properties and processes as they relate to ability of soil to function effectively as a component of a healthy ecosystem. Specific functions and subsequent values provided by forest ecosystems are variable and rely on numerous soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes, which can differ across spatial and temporal scales. Choice of a standard set of specific properties as indicators of soil quality can be complex and will vary among forest systems and management objectives. Indices of forest soil quality which incorporate soil chemical, physical, and biological properties will be most readily adopted if they are sensitive to management-induced changes, easily measured, relevant across sites or over time, inexpensive, closely linked to measurement of desired values, and adaptable for specific ecosystems. This paper traces development of the concept of soil quality, explores use of soil chemical and physical properties as determinants of forest soil quality, and presents challenges and opportunities for forest soil scientists to play a relevant role in assessment and advancement of sustainable forest management by developing the concept of soil quality as an indicator of sustainability. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Methods: 1250 subjects, from 18 to 64 years old, were randomly selected from the Santander (Spain) municipal census. A two-stage method was used: in the first stage, all individuals selected completed the BDI; in the second, 'probable cases' (BDI cut-off\u226513) and a random 5% sample of the total sample with a BDI score less than 13 were interviewed by psychiatrists using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), which generates diagnoses of depressive disorders. Results: Our data confirm the predictive value of the selected cut-off point (12/13): 100% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 0.72 PPV, 1 NPV, and 98% overall diagnostic value. The area under ROC (AUC) was found to be 0.99. There were no statistical differences in terms of sex or age. We conclude that the BDI is a good instrument for screening depressive disorders in community surveys. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "This paper presents a multisector dynamic general equilibrium model of business cycles with a distinctive feature: aggregate fluctuations are driven by independent sectoral shocks. The model hypothesizes that trade among sectors provides a strong synchronization mechanism for these shocks due to the limited, but locally intense, interaction that is characteristic of such input trade flows. Limited interaction, characterized by a sparse intermediate input-use matrix, reduces substitution possibilities among intermediate inputs which strengthens comovement in sectoral value-added and leads to a postponement of the law of large numbers in the variance of aggregate value-added. The chief virtue of this model is that reliance on implausible aggregate shocks is not necessary to capture the qualitative features of macroeconomic fluctuations. Building on Horvath, 1998, Review of Economic Dynamics 1, 781-808, which establishes the theoretical foundation for the relevance of limited interaction in the context of a stylized multisector model, this paper specifies a more general multisector model calibrated to the US 2-digit Standard Industrial Code economy. Simulations prove the model is able to match empirical reality as closely as standard one-sector business cycle models without relying on aggregate shocks. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) primarily infects two different populations in which the virus is transmitted in very diverse ways. In endemically infected populations, the virus is propagated through sexual contact, and by mother to child transmission via breast-feeding, among intravenous drug users (IDUs), spread is mainly due to blood-borne transmission via needle sharing. The phylogeny of HTLV-II strains isolated from American Indian and Pygmy tribes and strains from IDUs, reveal that the virus originated on the African continent as a result of a simian to human transmission at least 400,000 years ago. HTLV-II was very likely introduced into the American continent during one or more migrations of HTLV-II infected Asian populations over the Bering land bridge, some 15,000-35,000 years ago. During the last few decades, HTLV-II has been transmitted from native American Indians to IDUs at least twice, followed by a rapid spread of the virus in the drug users population world-wide due to the practice of needle sharing. Molecular clock analysis showed that HTLV-II has two different evolutionary rates, with the molecular clock for the virus in IDUs ticking 150-350 times faster than the one in endemically infected tribes: 2.7 \u00d7 10-4 compared to 1.7/7.3 \u00d7 10-7 nucleotide substitutions per site per year in the LTR region. Although many of the HTLV-II infected drug users are co-infected with HIV, the dramatic acceleration of the evolutionary rate seems to be mainly related to the different modes of transmission in the two populations. These contrasting evolutionary rates correlate with an endemic spread of HTLV-II in infected tribes compared to an epidemic spread in IDUs. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The HM samples were isolated with two different chromatographic methods: (1) non-ionic sorbing solid (standard XAD technique) with preacidification of a water sample to pH 2; and (2) weakly basic anion exchanger (DEAE, diethylaminoethyl cellulose) without any preacidification. A detailed structural analysis of degradation products was performed and compositional differences between different HM samples were evaluated. The main degradation products, in addition to varying proportions of different nitrogen and sulphur compounds, were methyl derivatives of different phenols, alkylphenols, phenolic acids and aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, which speak for the importance of ester linkages between the different structural subunits of aquatic HM. Despite all HM samples yielded qualitatively quite similar organic compounds, some fundamental quantitative differences existed. As a general rule, the DEAE isolate and two main XAD fractions: conventional fulvic (FA) and humic (HA) acids, seem to consist of almost similar organic matter dominating by different phenols and aliphatic acids. The other two special XAD fractions appear to belong to different structural categories yielding more alkylbenzenes/styrenes, alkanes and aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. The structural analyses and statistical calculations on the different HM samples support the postulation that the structural composition of the DEAE isolate corresponds to a certain average of the four different acidic XAD fractions.

Two offshore spawning areas were identified in the central North Sea - central-northern and central-southern. A general linear model (GLM) showed plaice sexual maturation was influenced by body weight, age and geographical location and was subject to annual and seasonal variation. Few three year old female place appeared to spawn in the central North Sea, similar to the situation early in the 20th century. The condition factor of plaice peaked at the start of spawning and declined sharply during spawning, with older females investing the most heavily in reproduction, both in absolute and relative terms. The loss of older females through fishing is, therefore, likely to compromise the overall reproductive fitness of the remaining population, comprising of young females. The reproductive fitness of the males was also compromised, since young males tended to be in running condition for about a month less than older males. Reproductive investment in females was about twice the level found in males. There was evidence that plaice in the northern North Sea matured at a slower rate than fish in the south. From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s there was an increase in the proportion of young plaice reaching sexual maturity, following an earlier decline from the late 1970s. Problems with using maturity ogives derived from market sampling data in order to assess the proportion of spawning plaice in the North Sea are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The best condition for electrochemical response was obtained with 0.05 mol l-1 Tris-HCl buffer at pH 6.0 and T-800 sized carbon fibre electrode. Initially the voltammograms were processed using Fourier transform filter and principal component analysis (PCA) to noise reduction and data compression, respectively. The scores of these principal components were the input into the neural network and the optimal brain surgeon (OBS) was the procedure employed for pruning the neural network. The results obtained with pruning procedure were slightly better in relation to hydroquinone in comparison to the PLS1 and PLS2. However, the similar errors were obtained to catechol when using PLS or neural networks models. Using neural networks with pruning was possible to determine catechol and hydroquinone by DPV using carbon fibre electrode, in concentration range of 1.0 x 10-4 up to 6.0 x 10-4 mol l- 1 with root mean square errors of predictions (%RMSEP) of 7.42 and 8.02, respectively.

The smoothing capabilities of these two techniques were tested using both experimental and artificial data. We found a very peculiar and unexpected behavior. Although Ratzlaff-Johnoson's smoothing method fails completely to smooth an individual 2D set of data, something, which can be done effectively by Kuo's approach, it may give better results than Kuo's approach if it is used with the moving window technique.

A comparison of borehole temperature data obtained in the trench, at the toe of the deformed sedimentary wedge, and at a midslope location indicates that the thermal regimes are perturbed by appreciable advective flux at ~ 1 km oceanward (19 mm yr-1) and ~ 1.4 km landward (5-7 mm yr-1) of the deformation front. This observation is loosely consistent with models that predict the most rapid dewatering and highest rates of fluid expulsion within a few kilometers of the deformation front. Using data that constrain the thickness of the GHZ at three sites on the forearc, we estimate methane and fluid flux rates through application of a one-dimensional analytical model that constrains the nature of the plumbing system for the gas hydrate reservoir. Our results indicate a two-fold decrease in methane flux between a site located ~ 400 m from the toe of the wedge and a site 12 km from the toe. An intermediate site located 1.4 km from the toe of the wedge has a thick GHZ (extends to at least 340-365 m below seafloor) that requires a very high methane supply rate (> 345 mol m-2 kyr-1 for a mass flux of 5 mm yr-1). We conclude that this site has the most two-dimensional fluid flux regime, with fluids being fed into the zone laterally by conduits and fractures and vertically by expulsion during compaction of underthrusting sediments.

The groups included control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats treated with or without DL-\u03b1-lipoic acid (100 mg kg-1 day-1, i.p., for 6 weeks). All parameters were measured in individual retinae. 4-Hydroxyalkenal concentration was increased in diabetic rats (2.63 \u00b1 0.60 vs. 1.44 \u00b1 0.30 nmol/mg soluble protein in controls, P < 0.01), and this increase was prevented by DL-\u03b1-lipoic acid (1.20 \u00b1 0.88, P < 0.01 vs. untreated diabetic group). Malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations were similar among the groups. Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), glutathione reductase (GSSGRed) and glutathione transferase (GSHTrans) activities were decreased in diabetic rats vs. controls. Quinone reductase was upregulated in diabetic rats, whereas catalase and cytoplasmic NADH oxidase activities were unchanged. DL-\u03b1-Lipoic acid prevented changes in superoxide dismutase and quinone reductase activities induced by diabetes without affecting the enzymes of glutathione metabolism. In conclusion, accumulation of 4- hydroxyalkenals is an early marker of oxidative stress in the diabetic retina. Increased lipid peroxidation occurs in the absence of GSH depletion, and is prevented by DL-\u03b1-lipoic acid. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A holistic approach (a study of ecosystems as complete entities) was carried out for a paleoecological reconstruction of the mires. Huminite, liptinite and inertinite were traced by means of their chemical and morphological differences together with the morphogenic and taphonomic affinities. The problem of combining independent information from different approaches in a multivariate calibration setup has been considered. Linear regression, non-metric multidimensional scaling and one-way analysis of variance tested the occurrence of palynological and petrological proxies. Although the lignite formation and deposition are less related to humid periods than expected, the resulting differences occurring in the reconstructed development stages appear to be related to astronomically forced climate fluctuations.

On this time interval, the VADM shows ample fluctuations from a minimum of 2.3 X 1022 Am2 to a maximum of 11.5 X 1022 Am2, about an average value of 7.0 \u00b1 2.3 X 1022 Am2, suggesting that fluctuations of the geomagnetic field strength comparable in amplitude to the time-averaged value may be a characteristic of the field.

        "Absrtact": "The eastern margin of the East European Craton (EEC), adjacent to the Middle and Southern Urals, is characterised by broad, large amplitude magnetic anomalies due to magnetic rocks within the crystalline basement. These anomalies most commonly have east to north-east trends and contrast markedly with the north-trending, shorter wavelength anomalies over the Uralide orogen to the east. The trace of a line drawn along the truncation of the characteristic EEC anomalies is offset to the west of the Main Uralian Fault in the Southern Urals, crossing Precambrian units which were subject to relatively modest westward-directed thrusting during the Palaeozoic Uralian orogeny. In contrast, the magnetic models require either a major down-to-the-east displacement of an underlying magnetic basement or juxtaposition of dissimilar basement units. Integration of magnetic modelling of the EEC basement with structural mapping and seismic interpretation confirms that the truncation of the magnetic basement is difficult to explain in terms of structures developed during the Uralian orogeny. There is a correlation between the edge of the magnetic basement and the western limit of deformation associated with an earlier (Late Vendian) orogeny. The feature truncating the crystalline basement may have been initiated during the Vendian event, but our preferred interpretation is that it is an earlier structure, perhaps formed by rifting in Riphean times. The edge of the crystalline basement block subsequently acted as a buttress, significantly influencing later deformation. This margin of the EEC thus appears to have been the focus for rifting and orogenic episodes spanning a time interval of more than 1 Ga. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

A significant calcareous nannofossil composition change has been recognized within the Serpentinus Zone, and a useful succession of nannofossil events has been calibrated to the ammonite biostratigraphy. This succession includes: FO of Lotharingius sigillatus (Mirabile Subzone); LO of Mitrolithus jansae (Semicelatum Subzone); FO of Carinolithus cantaluppii (Strangewaysi Subzone); LOs of Biscutum grande and Biscutum finchii (lower part of the Serpentinus Zone); FO of Carinolithus superbus (Strangewaysi-Falciferum boundary); FO of Lotharingius velatus (Falciferum Subzone); FOs of Discorhabdus striatus and Discorhabdus ignotus (Serpentinus-Bifrons boundary) and 'acme end' of Lotharingius hauffii (Variabilis-Illustris boundary). In the studied sections, the composition changes, the biohorizons recognized and their succession are closely comparable with other early-middle Toarcian Boreal sections.

        "Absrtact": "The Rodinia reconstruction of the Neoproterozoic Supercontinent has dominated discussion of the late Precambrian Earth for the past decade and originated from correlation of sedimentary successions between western North America and eastern Australia. Subsequent developments have sited other blocks according to a distribution of ~ 1100 Ma orogenic belts with break-up involving a putative breakout of Laurentia and rapid reassembly of continent crust to produce Gondwana by early Phanerozoic times. The Rodinia reconstruction poses several serious difficulties, including: (a) absence of palaeomagnetic correlation after ~ 730 Ma which requires early fragmentation of continental crust although geological evidence for this event is concentrated more than 150 Ma later near the Cambrian boundary, and (b) the familiar reconstruction of Gondwana is only achieved by exceptional continental motions largely unsupported by evidence for ocean consumption. Since the geological evidence used to derive Rodinia is non-unique, palaeomagnetic data must be used to evaluate its geometrical predictions. Data for the interval ~ 1150-500 Ma are used here to test the Rodinia model and compare it with an alternative model yielding a symmetrical crescent-shaped analogue of Pangaea (Palaeopangaea). Rodinia critically fails the test by requiring Antarctica to occupy the location of a quasi-integral Africa, whilst Australia and South America were much closer to their Gondwana configurations around Africa than implied by Rodinia. Palaeopangaea appears to satisfy palaeomagnetic constraints whilst surmounting geological difficulties posed by Rodinia. The relative motions needed to produce Gondwana are then relatively small, achieved largely by sinistral transpression, and consistent with features of Pan-African orogenesis; continental dispersal did not occur until the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian boundary. Analogies between Palaeopangaea and (Neo)pangaea imply that supercontinents are not chaotic agglomerations of continental crust but form by episodic coupling of upper and lower mantle convection leading to conformity with the geoid.

The benthic foraminifera prove to be excellent indicators of variations in the oxygen contents of the bottom waters, even more so than the stable isotopes. Our data indicate a step-wise restriction of the Mediterranean-Atlantic water exchange resulting in increasing sluggishness of deep-water circulation. The first indication of restricted circulation is seen at 8.5 Ma, which may correspond to a severe restriction of the external zone of the Betic Strait. A second event, which had a very serious influence on the fauna in the deeper Mediterranean, occurred at 7.16 Ma. This event was presumably linked to the partial closure of the Rifian Corridor. The restricted Mediterranean-Atlantic connection also seems to have led to a gradual salinity increase and possibly to the formation of a brine in the deepest basins, thus marking the first development towards the Messinian Salinity Crisis.

The resulting electron densities exceed the ones expected due to solar control alone; the D-region part of these excess densities is responsible for the absorption measured by a riometer. Hence riometer absorption is a good parameter to describe the disturbed ionosphere. An approach is presented in which a huge number of lower ionosphere electron densities from EISCAT and in-situ measurements from sounding rockets are analysed jointly. The much smaller number of rocket borne measurements constitutes an important extension to lower altitudes and densities. The undisturbed ionosphere deduced from these data sets is compared to a model of the non-auroral D-region extrapolated to high latitudes. Typical profiles for disturbed conditions are given separately for day and night as a function of riometer absorption. \u00a9 1999 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The first level of visualization was at the single station or grouped stations using the box-and-whisker plot as a graphical/statistical tool. This plot was used to compare intra-annual variability and correlation between total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (chl a) at a site in Florida Bay. Secondly, time was added as a dimension to produce a 9-year, monthly time series plot of declining salinity at a site in NE Florida Bay. It was shown how a centred moving average could be used to smooth out the noise and disclose inter-annual oscillations. Time series of anomalies from long term means were discussed as a means of displaying correspondence and coupling among variables. Thirdly, the utility of 2-D contour maps of variables was demonstrated in showing sources and mixing of fresh water across the hydroscape as well as nutrient loading to the South Florida ecosystem. From this expanded spatial view, it was observed that the water quality of different bays and coastal areas are differentially affected both by external and internal processes and how management of pump operations and canal conductance can overwhelm the natural hydrological cycle and have far reaching impacts in Florida Bay and the SW Florida Shelf. We also showed that contouring was useful for elucidating causal relationships among variables over the spatial domain. Time step animations of monthly salinity contours in Florida Bay showed the importance of mixing with western boundary waters to alleviation of hypersaline conditions. These animations also showed that it is the shifting lags between TP concentration and chl a which make it so difficult to derive a simple regression model. Finally, a 3-D volumetric rendering of the area between Key West and the Tortugas was used to describe a strong density stratification event during July 1998 and to visualize the source of water masses and general circulation patterns in this region. It is concluded that visualization techniques are useful not only to show patterns in the data but in developing new hypotheses for future research and monitoring activities.

Although well established in the biostatistics literature, applications of these techniques are almost nonexistent in the field of epidemiology. The authors applied four different regression approaches for recurrent events (logistic, Poisson, and two different Cox proportional hazards regressions) to derive rate ratios of hospitalizations for various prognostic factors in a cohort of 2424 frail elderly. Over a median follow-up of 670 days, 3299 hospitalizations were observed in 1564 persons. Estimated rate ratios were similar in all four approaches and virtually identical in three. With all methods, confidence intervals of the rate ratios were considerably wider than with naive Poisson regression neglecting intraindividual dependence of events. Appropriate analysis of recurrent events is feasible with minor modifications of multivariable models familiar to epidemiologists and should no longer be neglected in epidemiologic research. In our setting, Poisson regression was the most convenient approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

The method is based on shrinking noisy discrete wavelet transform coefficients via thresholding, and it can be used for any MRI data-set with no need for high power computers. Unlike previous wavelet application to MR images, the denoising algorithm is applied, separately, to the two orthogonal sets of the complex MR image. The norm of the combined data are used to construct the image. With this method, signal- noise decoupling and Gaussian white noise assumptions used in the wavelet noise suppression scheme, are better fulfilled. The performance of the method is tested by carrying out a qualitative and quantitative comparison of a single-average image, complex-denoised image, multiple-average images, and a magnitude-denoised image, of a standard phantom. The comparison shows that the complex-denoising scheme improves the signal-to-noise and contrast-to- noise ratios more than the magnitude-denoising scheme, particularly in low SNR regions. To demonstrate the method strength, it is applied to fMRI data of somatosensory rat stimulation. It is shown that the activation area in a cross-correlation analysis is \u02dc63% larger in the complex-denoised versus original data sets when equal threshold value is used. Application of the method of Principal Component Analysis to the complex-denoised, magnitude- denoised, and original data sets results in a similar but higher variance of the first few principal components obtained from the former data set as compared to those obtained from the later two sets.",

Commonly utilised disability outcome measures are problematic both in usefulness and clinical interpretation when applied to MS subjects with fluctuating and variable disease courses. An alternative technique is to use the summary measure 'area under the disability/time curve' (AUC) to index the total in-trial morbidity experienced by patients. In this study, we applied AUC analyses to the serial Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores from the U.S. multicentre, Phase III, two-year core study of glatiramer acetate in 251 RRMS patients. When all available EDSS evaluations were analysed with AUC(CHANGE) ('combined data', including relapse-related assessments), active treatment was significantly superior to placebo (P=0.018). The benefits of glatiramer acetate persisted when transient relapse effects were reduced by using 'scheduled visit data' only (P=0.021). With the more conservative AUC(SUM) measure, significant active treatment effects remained (P=0.029 and 0.046, for both 'combined' and 'scheduled visit' data, respectively). Subgroup calculations performed with baseline disability stratified at EDSS 3.5 also showed benefits of treatment over placebo, but statistical significance was not reached. This analysis of data from a Phase III treatment trial illustrates the AUC summary measure technique and provides further evidence of the efficacy of glatiramer acetate in RRMS.

In this review, options to optimise the LC analysis of basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, i.e. eluent optimisation (pH, silanol blockers) and stationary phase optimisation (development of new columns with minimised ionic interactions). The applicability of empirical based, thermodynamically based and test methods based on a retention model to characterise silica-based reversed phase stationary phases, as well as the influence of the eluent composition on the LC analysis of basic substances is described. Finally, the applicability of chemometrical techniques in column classification is shown. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "This study was done to evaluate the impact of pure Norway spruce stands on physical soil properties of top soil in comparison to mixed species stands on comparable sites. It was hypothesized that the flat root system of spruce causes soil compaction, which would have a negative impact on the soil aeration and hydraulic properties and consequently on seedbed quality, as well as early tree growth and seedling establishment. Hence, this topic is important for forest restoration, especially converting secondary pure spruce stands to mixed species stands. Forty-eight sites (24 pairs pure spruce stand/mixed species stand) of different stand development stages (mature stage, pole stage) were selected on two different bedrock materials (Molasse, Flysch). Undisturbed soil cores were taken from 0-4 and 4-8 cm soil depth and the following soil parameters were determined: (total) bulk density, remaining fine soil bulk density, dry masses of coarse fragments, roots and forest floor, organic carbon content, total soil pore volume as well as macropore volumes (after free drainage for 24 h and after water desorption at 10 kPa). The remaining fine soil bulk density was a useful parameter for characterization of the state of compactness. Pure spruce stands caused a lower bulk density of the upper mineral soil due to lifting and loosening of the soil above the root system. Results of calculated macropore volumes after water desorption at 10 kPa were exactly conform with those obtained for the remaining fine soil bulk density, indicating significant differences for the grouping variables bedrock material and species composition. It is concluded from this study that changes of soil physical properties of the upper mineral soil (0-8 cm soil depth) by Norway spruce will not reduce germination and growth of mixed species trees. However, chemical and nutritional changes were not subject of this study, which are expected to limit the success of forest restoration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Using recent time-series techniques for the case of imported automobiles in Switzerland, the results show that prices are strategic complements and that the degree of pass-through is lower in the long run than in the short run. This is due to the fact that, although some rivals match long-term price changes, others do not, inducing the producer who faces a change in exchange rate to absorb a greater proportion of the variation. The degrees of pass-through are also low with respect to other studies which do not endogenize pricing behavior. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Whilst the interplay between tectonics, glaciation and oceanography is reasonably well understood on some high-latitude margins, relatively little is known about the nature of Quaternary processes affecting the continental margin north of the Faeroe Islands. We therefore present side-scan sonar (GLORIA and TOBI) and 3.5 kHz data in combination with a new regional bathymetry in order to characterise and analyse the margin's physiography and the sedimentary processes that have occurred in the area during the Late Quaternary. Seven acoustic facies are identified and interpreted, in combination with published core records. The margin is subject to differing sedimentation regimes over glacial/interglacial cycles, relating to the changing importance of contouritic, hemipelagic, glacimarine and mass-movement processes. Mass movement is much more extensive than previously thought, with a total sediment volume of >2000 km3, similar to that of the Storegga Slide (5500 km3) and may occur primarily at glacial terminations. The downslope limit of instabilities is associated with a series of channels, focusing the deposition of distal, turbiditic sediments into the regional deep beyond. Together with glacigenic debris flows from the western margin of the North Sea Fan, mass-movement processes are identified to have affected 52-70% of the North Faeroes margin area. In contrast, distal glacimarine sedimentation, alternating with hemipelagic and contouritic development, is found on the remaining 30-48% of the margin during glacials, and hemipelagic and contouritic Sedimentation are active across 90% of the margin in interglacial conditions. Despite a lack of any local, direct glacial influence, these observations on the relative importance of sedimentation processes are comparable with other glacially influenced passive margins.

Electrical stimulation of the paralemniscal midbrain and local delivery of VIP were conducted in conjunction with occipital nerve recordings that reflect the patterned output of hindbrain vocal circuitry. Consistent with our hypothesis, VIP significantly reduced the duration and number of rhythmic vocal-motor bursts obtained in a dose-dependent manner; vocalization latency was concomitantly increased. These results provide the first evidence for VIP modulation of midbrain vocal function. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Time series of suspended-silt concentration (measured by an optical backscatter sensor) and suspended-sand concentration (measured by an acoustic backscatter sensor) in a deep channel (14 m MSL) of a large New Zealand estuary (Manukau Harbour) are analysed. Suspended-sand concentration varied in phase with the current speed and bed shear stress on a ~ 6.2-h cycle, but suspended-silt concentration varied on a semidiurnal (~ 12.4-h) cycle such that the channel was clear of silt at high tide and maximum silt concentration occurred at low tide. Threshold for initiation of sand motion was found to be related to local skin friction, sand concentration profiles were consistent with settling flux balanced by gradient diffusion with a two-layer sediment diffusivity dependent on local friction velocity, suspended-sand reference concentration was explainable in terms of local skin friction, and changes in the channel-bed sediment were correlated with the suspended-sand load. Therefore, sand suspension in the channel is a 'local' process and the channel bed is the source of the suspended-sand load. Suspended-sand flux was found to be a highly nonlinear function of the tidal current speed in the channel. In that case, tidal-current velocity asymmetry is the principal determinant of direction of net sand transport and the ebb/flood-dominance concept is valid. The relative phase of the M2 and M4 constituents of the tidal-current velocity, which quantifies tidal-current asymmetry, was calculated from a tide model of the estuary and results were mapped. The harbour was found to be broadly ebb dominant and therefore self-flushing of sand. Silt suspension in the channel was not related to the local boundary-layer dynamics, but was explainable in terms of the movement up and down the channel of a horizontal gradient in silt concentration, which implies the existence of a turbid water mass that is perched on the surrounding intertidal flats at high tide and that drains into the channel during ebb tide. Silt concentration in the channel increased during a short storm, which corresponded to the passage through the measurement site of a 'turbid fringe' that was formed on the surrounding intertidal flats during the previous high tide under the action of breaking waves. Wave activity on the surrounding intertidal flats is therefore the principal determinant of suspended-silt load in the channel and an approach that treats waves and sediment pathways between intertidal flats and channels is needed for modelling silt transport.

In order to select the best out of a large diversity of available nitrogen sources, the yeast has developed molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms consist of a sensing mechanism and a regulatory mechanism which includes induction of needed systems, and repression of systems that are not beneficial. The first step in use of most nitrogen sources is its uptake via more or less specific permeases. Hence the first level of regulation is encountered at this level. The next step is the degradation of the nitrogen source to useful building blocks via the nitrogen metabolic pathways. These pathways can be divided into routes that lead to the degradation of the nitrogen source to ammonia and glutamate, and routes that lead to the synthesis of nitrogen containing compounds in which glutamate and glutamine are used as nitrogen donor. Glutamine is synthesized out of ammonia and glutamate. The expression of the specific degradation routes is also regulated depending on the availability of a particular nitrogen source. Ammonia plays a central role as intermediate between degradative and biosynthetic pathways. It not only functions as a metabolite in metabolic reactions but is also involved in regulation of metabolic pathways at several levels. This review describes the central role of ammonia in nitrogen metabolism. This role is illustrated at the level of enzyme activity, translation and transcription.",

We have previously shown that the major classes of animal homeodomains originated early in the evolution of metazoans. Here, I investigate the evolutionary relationships of homeodomain sequences in plants. Using distance matrix approaches with unweighted or weighted character state transitions, the overall results support the same conclusion: in plants, as in animals, multiple independent classes of divergent homeodomains can be distinguished, again suggesting an early evolutionary origin. These studies advance the hypothesis that the homeodomain represents a fundamental motif of gene regulation in multicellular organisms. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The recent fusion of genome-scale experimental tools, a more comprehensive gene catalog, and concomitant advances in computational methodology, has extended the range of questions being posed. The potential to further our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and to accelerate the delineation of regulatory control regions in the human genome is enormous.",

        "Absrtact": "Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) in the diagnosis of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and to compare its performance to that of a traditional linear regression model. Materials and Methods: 1903 LUTS patients referred to the University Hospital Nijmegen between 1992 and 1998 received routine investigation, consisting of transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate, serum PSA measurement, assessment of symptoms and quality of life by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), urinary flowmetry with determination of maximum flow rate (Qmax), voided volume and post-void residual urine and full pressure flow studies (PFS). Using a three-layered backpropagation ANN with three hidden nodes, the outcome of PFS, quantified by the Abrams-Griffiths number (AG-number), was estimated based on all available non-invasive diagnostic test results plus patient age. The performance of the network was quantified using sensitivity, specificity and the area under the ROC-curve (AUC). The results of the neural network approach were compared to those of a linear regression analysis. Results: Prostate volume, Qmax, voided volume and post void residual urine showed substantial predictive value concerning the outcome of PFS. Patient age, PSA- level, IPSS and Quality of life did not add to that prediction. Using a cut- off value in predicted and true AG-numbers of 40 cm. H2O, the neural network approach yielded sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 69%, respectively. The AUC of the network was 0.75 (standard error = 0.01). A linear regression model produced identical results. Conclusions: This study shows that at an individual level, the outcome of PFS cannot be predicted accurately by the available non-invasive tests. The use of ANNs, which are better able than traditional regression models to identify non-linear relations and complex interactions between variables, did not improve the prediction of BOO. Thus, if precise urodynamic information is considered important in the diagnosis of men with LUTS, PFS must be carried out. Both neural networks and regression analysis appear promising to identify patients who should undergo PFS, and those in whom PFS can safely be omitted. Furthermore, the ability of ANNs and regression models to predict treatment result should be evaluated.",

Mantle xenoliths found in the potassic rocks are mainly spinel peridotite (some phlogopite-bearing) associated with minor Fe-rich peridotite (some phlogopite-bearing) and pyroxenite. Clinopyroxene in the spinel peridotite xenoliths is generally low in Al2O3, Sc, Y and heavy rare earth elements and along with orthopyroxene and spinel has high Cr/ (Cr + Al). The bulk rock has low basaltic components (Al2O3, CaO and TiO2), demonstrating their refractory nature. However, the relatively low forsterite contents (<0.915) of olivine and high bulk rock Ca/Al (1.3-4.1) and Mg/Si (1.2-1.6) ratios at given Mg/(Mg + Fe) distinguish them from either Archaean lithospheric mantle or the residue of melt extraction from Phanerozoic oceanic mantle. Clinopyroxenes from all the xenoliths are enriched in light rare earth elements, Th and Pb and depleted in high field strength elements, with similar incompatible element and rare earth element patterns. Clinopyroxenes from the spinel peridotite xenoliths have 87Sr/86Sr (0.70480-0.70516) higher than primitive mantle, but variable ENd values (+6.9 to -2.0). Petrological and geochemical evidence from the xenoliths supports a common two-stage evolution model for the upper part of the lithospheric mantle in the region. The mantle protolith was stabilised after moderate to high degrees of melt extraction (e.g. 8-13% for fractional melting) and then metasomatised extensively by SiO2-undersaturated potassic magma that was likely generated from low-degree partial melting of either deep asthenosphere or metasomatised lower part of lithospheric mantle. Both the melt extraction and metasomatic event(s) may have occurred during the Proterozoic. Geochemical signatures of the spinel peridotite xenoliths and the inferred garnet peridotites at the base of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle from chemistry of the host potassic rocks (Zhang et al., J. Petrol., 36 (1995) 1275; Zhang et al., AGU Geodynamic Series, 27 (1998) 197) indicates the preservation of a Proterozoic lithospheric mantle section within the Phanerozoic Central Asian Fold Belt. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AquaFarm provides: (1) simulation of physical, chemical, and biological unit processes; (2) simulation of facility and fish culture management; (3) compilation of facility resource and enterprise budgets; and (4) a graphical user interface and data management capabilities. These analytical tools are combined into an interactive, decision support system for the simulation, analysis, and evaluation of alternative design and management strategies. The quantitative methods and models used in AquaFarm are primarily adapted from the aquaculture science and engineering literature and mechanistic in nature. In addition, new methods have been developed and empirically based simplifications implemented as required to construct a comprehensive, practically oriented, system level, aquaculture simulator. In the use of AquaFarm, aquaculture production facilities can be of any design and management intensity, for purposes of broodfish maturation, egg incubation, and/or growout of finfish or crustaceans in cage, single pass, serial reuse, water recirculation, or solar-algae pond systems. The user has total control over all facility and management specifications, including site climate and water supplies, components and configurations of fish culture systems, fish and facility management strategies, unit costs of budget items, and production species and objectives (target fish weights/states and numbers at given future dates). In addition, parameters of unit process models are accessible to the user, including species-specific parameters of fish performance models. Based on these given specifications, aquaculture facilities are simulated, resource requirements and enterprise budgets compiled, and operation and management schedules determined so that fish production objectives are achieved. When facility requirements or production objectives are found to be operationally or economically unacceptable, desired results are obtained through iterative design refinement. Facility performance is reported to the user as management schedules, summary reports, enterprise budgets, and tabular and graphical compilations of time-series data for unit process, fish, and water quality variables. Application of AquaFarm to various types of aquaculture systems is demonstrated. AquaFarm is applicable to a range of aquaculture interests, including education, development, and production.

Increases in household income lead to greater investments in girls' schooling but have no significant impact on schooling of boys. Improvements in father's education raises the schooling of both sons and daughters (favoring the latter) but mother's education has significant impact only on daughters' schooling; these estimates are suggestive of differences in maternal and paternal preferences for schooling daughters relative to sons. Domestic responsibilities, represented for example by the number of very young siblings, impinge strongly on girls' education but not on boys'. Policies such as subsidized childcare that reduce the opportunity cost of girls' time in the home may therefore increase their ability to get an education.This study investigates gender differences in the determinants of several schooling indicators in Conakry, Guinea, using ordered and binary probit models incorporating household-level random effects. Such indicators include grade attainment, current enrollment, and withdrawal from school. The survey, which was conducted on 1725 households, contains detailed information on a wide range of socioeconomic factors such as education, labor force activity and earnings, assets and health. Results indicate that increases in household income lead to greater investments in the schooling of girls than in the schooling of boys. Meanwhile, improvements in the education of fathers raise the schooling of both sons and daughters, while the education of mothers only has a significant impact on the schooling of daughters. These estimates show differences in maternal and paternal preferences for schooling daughters relative to sons. Therefore, the importance of gender, parental education, and household income and composition affect the education of children. However, findings also show that education for girls is unnecessary since they only need to work at home. Moreover, policies that raise household incomes will increase gender equity in schooling, which will also depend on whether and how these policies change the opportunity costs of girls and boys and the labor market returns to female and male schooling.",

        "Absrtact": "During the Holocene, the eastern Sahara underwent a drastic climatic change: in less than 6000 years, the climate changed from hyperaridity to semiaridity and back to its current hyperarid state. The West Nubian Palaeolake Basin in NW Sudan (ca 18.5\u00b0N/25.5\u00b0E) contains widespread lake carbonates, which indicate development of a freshwater lake between approximately 9500 and 4000 years BP. The size of the lake has been estimated as between 1100 and 7000 km2. Water balance calculations and a dense drainage net surrounding the terminal lake indicate predominance of superficial and minor importance of groundwater inflow. A lake with an area of 1100 km2 would require an annual precipitation of approximately 500 mm to balance the respective aerial evaporation. Similar precipitation values are currently observed at a latitude of 12\u00b0N, some 600 km farther south, while the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin receives an annual rainfall of less than 15 mm/year. A lake size of 7000 km2 would have required 900 mm of annual rainfall, an amount characteristic of sub-tropical conditions. This value could indicate inhomogenities in the wet phase climate, which could strongly influence the water level of a terminal lake located in a flat terrain. The highly depleted oxygen isotope values of the lake carbonates indicate that the Holocene wet phase was characterized by intense tropical summer (monsoonal) rainfall with heavy thunderstorms. Thus, an intensified southwest palaeomonsoon apparently transported large quantities of moisture to the eastern Sahara, producing the necessary conditions for the persisting existence of freshwater in the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin. The reconstructed palaeoclimate implies high groundwater levels and corresponds to precipitation rates from other sites in North Africa. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The spatial extent of input parameter aggregation has previously been shown to have a substantial impact on model output. This study investigates this problem using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a distributed-parameter agricultural nonpoint source pollution model. The primary question addressed here is: how does the size or number of subwatersheds used to partition the watershed affect model output, and what are the processes responsible for model behavior? SWAT was run on the Pheasant Branch watershed in Dane County, WI, using eight watershed delineations, each with a different number of subwatersheds. Model runs were conducted for the period 1990-1996. Streamflow and outlet sediment predictions were not seriously affected by changes in subwatershed size. The lack of change in outlet sediment is due to the transport-limited nature of the Pheasant Branch watershed and the stable transport capacity of the lower part of the channel network. This research identifies the importance of channel parameters in determining the behavior of SWAT's outlet sediment predictions. Sediment generation estimates do change substantially, dropping by 44% between the coarsest and the finest watershed delineations. This change is primarily due to the sensitivity of the runoff term in the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation to the area of hydrologic response units (HRUs). This sensitivity likely occurs because SWAT was implemented in this study with a very detailed set of HRUs. In order to provide some insight on the scaling behavior of the model two indexes were derived using the mathematics of the model. The indexes predicted SWAT scaling behavior from the data inputs without a need for running the model. Such indexes could be useful for model users by providing a direct way to evaluate alternative models directly within a geographic information systems framework.

This sensitivity likely occurs because SWAT was implemented in this study with a very detailed set of HRUs. In order to provide some insight on the scaling behavior of the model two indexes were derived using the mathematics of the model. The indexes predicted SWAT scaling behavior from the data inputs without a need for running the model. Such indexes could be useful for model users by providing a direct way to evaluate alternative models directly within a geographic information systems framework.Agricultural nonpoint source pollution model accuracy may be affected by the spatial extent of input parameter aggregation. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to examine this problem, with attention to the effect on model output of size or number of subwatersheds used, and the processes contributing to model behavior. SWAT was applied to a small watershed in south central Wisconsin using eight different watershed delineations, each with different numbers of subwatersheds, over the time period 1990-96. Model predictions for streamflow and outlet sediment were not strongly affected by changes in subwatershed size, probably because of the transport-limiting nature of this watershed and the stable transport capacity of the lower part of the channel. Sediment generation estimates do change greatly, however, dropping by 44% between the coarsest and finest watershed delineations, mainly because a runoff term in the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation is very sensitive to the area of the hydrologic response unit. Two indexes were derived to better understand SWAT scaling behavior. Such indices can help evaluate alternative models directly within a geographic information system framework.",

        "Absrtact": "We describe the mineralogical and chemical composition of the Northern Slave mantle as deduced from xenoliths of peridotite within the Jericho kimberlite, Northwest Territories. Our data set includes modal, major, trace and rare earth element compositions of bulk samples of spinel peridotite, low-T and high-T garnet peridotite and minor pyroxenite. Compared to primitive upper mantle, Jericho peridotite shows depletion in the major elements and enrichment in incompatible elements (except for HREE). The Slave mantle is also uniquely stratified. Older, depleted spinel peridotite extends to a depth of 80-100 km and is underlain by garnet peridotite which shows a gradual decrease in Mg with depth to 200 km. The youngest layer of fertile garnet peridotite, enriched in clinopyroxene and garnet, is underlain by a pyroxenite-rich horizon at the base of the petrological lithosphere. The Northern Slave is further distinguished from the Kaapvaal and Siberian upper mantle by a marked vertical stratification in Mg, lower abundances of orthopyroxene and higher abundances of clinopyroxene. In addition, a deeper layer of garnet peridotite below Jericho shows less depletion than low-T peridotite from other cratons. The Northern Slave peridotite results from a series of chemical events that include: (i) high-degree melting of pyrolite at P>3 Gpa for low-T peridotite and lower pressure melting for high-T peridotite, (ii) enrichment of low-T spinel peridotite in orthopyroxene, and (iii) pervasive metasomatic enrichment in alkali and LREE's by kimberlite-related fluids. The chemical stratification described for two of the three lithospheric domains of the Slave craton makes this craton an exception among cratons with commonly unstratified lithospheres. The gradual increase in fertility with depth below the Slave craton is related to age stratification and may have formed by incremental downward growth of mantle lithosphere with time, and/or later re-fertilization of deeper mantle horizons.

        "Absrtact": "We examined structural features of montane ash stands that varied from 15 to 300+ years of age in the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Extensive field data were gathered for our investigation and were drawn from >3700 survey plots on >625 sites located throughout the study region. Much of our study focussed on understorey features because extensive past studies in these forests have highlighted their importance as key habitat components for wildlife. A wide range of stand features, including the abundance of shrubs, the prevalence of tree ferns, the presence of Acacia spp., the presence of Myrtle Beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii), and the number of vegetation strata (a measure of vertical heterogeneity) varied considerably between age classes; most attributes were significantly (p < 0.001) less likely to occur or were significantly less abundant in young logged forests. Highly significant differences in these structural features also were found in stands dominated by different tree species (Mountain Ash [Eucalyptus regnans] and Alpine Ash [E. delegatensis]). The traditional view of disturbance in montane ash forests is that of high-intensity stand-replacing wildfires which produce even-aged regrowth forests. However, our data suggest that low-intensity, non-stand-replacing fires or only partial stand-replacing fires, have occurred in many old-growth montane ash stands, both to create multi-aged stands and to re-juvenate components of the understorey - a process leading to asynchrony in the ages of understorey and some elements of the overstorey. Thus, the structural variability, and the patterns of natural disturbance leading to such conditions, appears to be more complex than often previously recognised. This has important implications for both nature conservation strategies and timber harvesting practices in montane ash forests. Existing high-intensity clearfell logging operations produce an even-aged dominant overstorey as well as understorey and overstorey plants of the same age. If logging effects are to more closely resemble natural disturbance regimes and promote structural complexity in stands of harvested forest to enhance wildlife habitat values, then a wider range of types of harvesting methods (in addition to clearfelling) need to be employed.

        "Absrtact": "Cooked meat products are often post-contaminated because of a packaging and/or slicing step after the pasteurisation process. The shelf life is therefore limited and can be extended by adding Na-lactate. A previously developed model for the spoilage of gas packed cooked meat products, including temperature, water activity and dissolved CO2 as independent variables, was extended with a fourth factor: the Na-lactate concentration in the aqueous phase of the meat product. Models were developed for the maximum specific growth rate \u03bc(max) and the lag phase \u03bb of the specific spoilage organism Lactobacillus sake subsp. carnosum. Quadratic response surface equations were compared with extended Ratkowsky models. In general, response surface equations fitted the experimental data best but in the case of \u03bc(max), the response surface model predicted illogical growth behaviour at low water activities and high Na-lactate concentrations. A extensive product validation of the mathematical models was performed by means of inoculated as well as naturally contaminated industrially prepared cooked meat products. The deviations of the experimentally determined versus predicted growth parameters in inoculated cooked meat products were in general small. Both types of models were also able to predict the shelf life of naturally contaminated cooked meat products, except for pate where an under-estimation of the shelf life was predicted by the response surface equations. The validation studies revealed higher accuracy of the extended Ratkowsky models in comparison to the response surface equations. A significant shelf life extending effect of Na-lactate was predicted, which was more pronounced at low refrigerated temperatures. A synergistic effect has also been noticed between Na-lactate and carbon dioxide which, at least partly, could be explained by the pH-decreasing effect of CO2.

A technique extensively used in marketing research, conjoint (CJ) analysis, is used in conjunction with a random utility model (RUM) to establish shadow valuations for various combinations of stream quality improvements in two streams. The technique shows promise in the valuation of ecosystems, which provide a complex variety of services. Several variations on respondent choice, binary choice (BC) and intensity of preference (IP) were used, where the latter allowed for an expression of degree of preference between status quo and alternative conditions. The sample constituted a panel data set from which user and non-user valuations were distinguished. In addition, sample respondents were identified by the distances of their residences to the stream sites, permitting the analysis of effects of distance on quality improvement valuations. These valuations suggested that persons living within roughly 50 miles of the evaluated stream segments place some positive value on stream improvements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

This paper reviews the potential to estimate marine primary production from satellite images. The procedures involved in retrieving estimates of phytoplankton biomass, as pigment concentrations, are discussed. Algorithms are applied to SeaWiFS ocean colour data to indicate seasonal variations in phytoplankton biomass in the Celtic Sea, on the continental shelf to the south west of the UK. Algorithms to estimate primary production rates from chlorophyll concentration are compared and the advantages and disadvantage discussed. The simplest algorithms utilise correlations between chlorophyll concentration and production rate and one equation is used to estimate daily primary production rates for the western English Channel and Celtic Sea; these estimates compare favourably with published values. Primary production for the central Celtic Sea in the period April to September inclusive is estimated from SeaWiFS data to be 102 gC m-2 in 1998 and 93 gC m-2 in 1999; published estimates, based on in situ incubations, are ca. 80 gC m-2. The satellite data demonstrate large variations in primary production between 1998 and 1999, with a significant increase in late summer in 1998 which did not occur in 1999. Errors are quantified for the estimation of primary production from simple algorithms based on satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration. These data show the potential to obtain better estimates of marine primary production than are possible with ship-based methods, with the ability to detect short-lived phytoplankton blooms. In addition, the potential to estimate new production from satellite data is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The Oman ophiolite exposes a large and well-preserved mantle section beneath a palaeo-spreading centre. The mantle section is mainly composed of extremely refractory harzburgites with relatively homogeneous modal and major element compositions. Nevertheless, our trace element data exhibit variations connected with the main mantle structures, which allow us to define three geochemical and structural domains. The main harzburgitic mantle section, mainly constituted of strongly refractory harzburgites characterised by chondrite-normalised REE patterns that are steadily depleted from HREE to LREE. These rocks are interpreted as mantle residues after >15% melt extraction. Their REE signature can be explained by melt transport associated with partial melting. The diapir areas (mainly the Maqsad diapir), defined by plunging lineations. They are constituted of harzburgites with roughly the same modal composition as the main mantle section but distinct, concave-upward REE patterns. The regions of most active upwelling (characterised by sub-vertical lineations) are further distinguished by higher Al2O3/CaO ratios and TiO2 contents. This character is ascribed to focused partial melt upwelling. The diapirs are interpreted as local instabilities in upwelling mantle, possibly triggered by feedback mechanisms between deformation and melt percolation. The Maqsad diapir is topped by a thick, dunitic, mantle-crust transition zone (MTZ) that displays the same trace-element signature as the diapir. However, the dunites are distinguishedby low MG values and Ni contents. Together with structural evidence, this allows us to interpret the MTZ dunites as diapir harzburgites that were strongly modified by olivine-forming melt-rock reactions at high melt/rock ratios. The MTZ is thought to act as a major collecting zone for mantle melts. The cpx-harzburgites from the base of the mantle section. These rocks are distinguished by high clinopyroxene contents (>5%), low AL2O3/CaO and 'spoon-shaped' REE patterns. They were individualised from the rest of the harzburgite mantle section by a cpx-forming melt-rock reaction at decreasing malt mass. This reaction probably occurred at near-solidus conditions along the lithospere-asthenospere boundary. The formation of these three domains may be integrated in a geodynamic scenario involving the reactivation of an oceanic lithospere, a process that would be related to the ridge propagator identified in the Oman ophiolite.

        "Absrtact": "Results from doped, hydrous experiments on natural mafic-to intermediate-composition lavas at 2-5 kbar pressure were combined with existing 1 atm data to evaluate the effects of composition and temperature on the partitioning behavior of the high field strength elements (HFSE), Zr, Nb, Ta and Hf between magnetite and natural silicate melts. Magnetite composition was found to be the strongest controlling factor on partitioning behavior. The partition coefficients (D) for Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta correlate with D(Ti), Ti and Al content of the magnetite, temperature and pressure. The partition coefficients for the HFSE are similar to one another for any given magnetite-melt pair, but range from <0.02 in Cr, Al-rich magnetites and chromites to >2 in titanomagnetite. In addition, the relationship between Ti and the HFSE changes as a function of pressure and temperature, with the HFSE becoming more incompatible relative to Ti at lower temperatures and/or higher pressures. This change in the relationship between D(Ti) and D(HFSE) with temperature and pressure means that the expressions presented in Nielsen et al. (1994) [Nielsen, R.L., Forsythe, L.M., Gallaghan, W.E., Fisk, M.R., 1994. Major and trace element magnetite-melt partitioning. Chem. Geol. 117, 167-191.] are not valid for hydrous, aluminous systems. Expressions were derived to describe the relationship between D(HFSE) and temperature, pressure, Fe2+/Mg exchange, Ti/Al ratio of the magnetite, and D(Ti). These expressions reproduce the input data within 35-50% (1 \u03c3) over a range extending from highly incompatible to compatible (<0.02-3.0). This internal precision represents ~3-4% of the observed range of partition coefficients. These patterns of behavior are consistent with the observed miscibility gap between the Al, Cr spinel group end members and ulvospinel and magnetite. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "If, as many climate change analysts* speculate, industrial and other emissions of CO2 can be offset by substitution of biofuels, large areas of land, including agricultural land, may be converted to the production of biomass feedstocks. This paper explores the feasibility for the Missouri-Iowa-Nebraska-Kansas (MINK) region of the US of converting some agricultural land to the production of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial warm season grass, as a biomass energy crop. The erosion productivity impact calculator (EPIC) crop growth model simulated production of corn (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), soybean (Glycine max L,), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and switchgrass at 302 sites within the MINK region. The analysis is done for both current climatic conditions and a regional climate model-based scenario of possible climate change. Daily climate records from 1983 to 1993 served as baseline and the NCAR-RegCM2 model (RegCM hereafter) nested within the CSIRO general circulation model (GCM) provided the climate change scenario. Crop production was simulated at two atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) at 365 and 560 ppm to consider the CO2-fertilization effect. Simulated yields of the perennial switchgrass increased at all sites with a mean yield increase of 5.0 Mg ha-1 under the RegCM climate change scenario. Switchgrass yields benefited from temperature increases of 3.0-8.0\u00b0C, which extended the growing season and reduced the incidence of cold stress. Conversely, the higher temperatures under the RegCM scenario decreased yields of corn, soybean, sorghum and winter wheat due to increased heat stress and a speeding of crop maturity. With no CO2-fertilization effect, EPIC simulated maximum decreases from baseline of 1.5 Mg ha-1 for corn, 1.0 Mg ha-1 for sorghum, 0.8 Mg ha-1 for soybean and 0.5 Mg ha-1 for winter wheat. Simulated yields increased for all crops under the RegCM scenario with CO2 set to 560 ppm. Yields increased above baseline for 34% of the soybean and 37% of the winter wheat farms under RegCM/[CO2] = 560 ppm scenario. Water use increased for all crops under the higher temperatures of the CSIRO scenario. Precipitation increases resulted in greater runoff from the traditional crops but not from switchgrass due to the crop's increased growth and longer growing season. Simulated soil erosion rates under switchgrass and wheat cultivation were less severe than under corn management. However, simulated erosion under switchgrass was considerable in eastern Iowa during the period of crop establishment because of strong winds at that time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Allometric approaches based only on tree diameter at breast height (DBH) have been used to estimate leaf biomass and leaf area index (LAI) in coniferous forests. This approach has been suggested to sometimes produce unrealistically high LAI estimates, notably in old-growth stands in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Leaf area to sapwood area relationships offer an alternative basis for estimating LAI and a number of empirical and modeling approaches have been used for generating treelevel sapwood area and leaf area estimates. To evaluate effects of the alternative assumptions among these approaches, we compared five algorithms for estimating leaf area per tree and stand-level LAI in stands dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var menziesii). Initially, 383 trees representing the major species and the complete range of tree sizes in the study area were examined for species, DBH, crown ratio, and sapwood area. There were significant species-specific relationships between sapwood and DBH for these trees. Neither crown ratio nor the ratio of observed tree height to expected tree height were effective in predicting the sign and magnitude of the residuals in the sapwood area/DBH relationships. Nine stands (three young, three mature, and three old-growth) in and near the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western central Oregon Cascades were then studied with species, DBH, and crown ratio recorded for all trees in a set of subplots. At the stand level, the LAI algorithms based on sapwood area at breast height produced significantly lower LAI estimates than the DBH-alone algorithm in mature and old-growth stands. The algorithm relying on estimated sapwood area at the base of the crown further reduced LAI estimates relative to those based on sapwood area at breast height. Although the differences between the DBH-based and sapwood area-based approaches tended to be greatest in the older stands, estimated LAI was higher in the older stands than in the younger stands for all algorithms. Comparative studies using allometric, litterfall, and optical approaches to LAI estimation are needed to resolve issues such as trends in LAI with succession and maximum possible LAI in Douglas-fir forests.",

The first structure of a mammalian microsomal P450 suggests that the association of P450s with the endoplasmic reticulum involves a hydrophobic surface of the protein formed by noncontiguous portions of the polypeptide chain. This interaction places the entrance of the putative substrate access channel in or near the membrane and orients the face of the protein proximal to the heme cofactor perpendicular to the plane of the membrane for interaction with the P450 reductase. This structure offers a template for modeling other mammalian P450s and should aid drug discovery and the prediction of drug-drug interactions.",

        "Absrtact": "High-resolution, three-dimensional, compressional and shear wave velocity models, derived from microearthquake traveltimes, are used to map the distribution of Poisson's ratio and porosity at Coso Geothermal Area, Inyo County, California. Spatial resolution of the three-dimensional Poisson's ratio and porosity distributions is estimated to be 0.5 km horizontally and 0.8 km vertically. Model uncertainties, \u00b11% in the interior and \u00b12.3% around the edge of the model, are estimated by a jackknife method. We use perturbations of r = V(p)/V(s) ratio and \u03a8 = V(p) \u00b7 V(s) product to derive distributions of Poisson's ratio, \u03c3, and porosity, which are then used to constrain and delineate possible zones of intense heat, fracture accumulation and fluid saturation. Poisson's ratio at Coso ranges from 0.15 to 0.35 with an average of 0.224, lower than the crustal average of 0.25. High Poisson's ratios are more extensive in shallower depths (<1.5 km) while lower Poisson's ratios are found in the deeper section (1.5-3.0 km) of the target area. Two major features with low Poisson's ratio are identified at geothermal production depth (1-3 km) around stations S2-S6 and S1-S3-S4. The two low-\u03c3 features are separated by a northwest-southeast-trending high-\u03c3 belt with variable width of 1-3 km. A high-\u03a8 body is found around S2 and S6, and extends down in depth. A circular, low-\u03a8 belt corresponding to the high-\u03c3 belt, is located around S2-S6 and is linked to a previously reported structure in V(s) tomography. This low-\u03a8 (highly porous) belt is probably a horizontal conduit/reservoir of geothermal fluid. A vertical, low-\u03c3 and high-\u03a8 channel beneath triangle S1-S3-S4 corresponds to a high-attenuation, dome-like feature. We propose an upwell-and-spread magma intrusion model for the last major magmatism in the Coso region. The magmatic upwelling is centered in the S1-S3-S4 area. The model predicts potential geothermal resources to the south and west of triangle S1-S3-S4 based on local faulting patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The present study investigates the sensitivity of distinct brain regions to the syntactic processing of running speech. Experimental conditions varied the grammaticality of sentence types (correct vs. incorrect). Moreover, two different groups of subjects listened to the same sentence material, but followed two different task instructions. All participants were asked to listen to the auditory stimuli and to perform in a grammaticality judgment-task, whereas only half of the subjects were instructed to additionally repair incorrect sentences covertly. Significantly increased brain responses occurred in several left temporal areas as a function of sentences' grammaticality, particularly, in the 'pure' judgment-group. Spatial extent as well as the strength of focal brain activation changed as a function of grammaticality and task demand. A generally enhanced pattern of local blood supply to the right peri-sylvian cortex could be observed when individuals additionally realized the repair-task. In particular, the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis and pars triangularis) and the right temporal transverse gyrus (Heschl's gyrus) were more strongly affected by the repair-task demand. In contrast, an anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (planum polare) displayed increased activation bilaterally. Although left hemisphere activation varied clearly as a function of a sentence's grammaticality, the present findings demonstrate an involvement of the right peri-sylvian cortex, in particular, when task demands explicitly require an on-line repair. The results as a whole suggest a reconsideration of the notion that auditory language comprehension is restricted to the left hemisphere. The underlying mechanisms and the respective roles of both the left and the right hemisphere during speech processing are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "During late September 1996, a major eruption took place at the NW part of the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in central Iceland. The eruption was preceded by intense seismic activity, which began with a Mw = 5.6 earthquake two days previously. Two very active volcanic systems, B\u00e1rdarbunga and Grimsv\u00f6tn, are situated in that area underneath the permanent ice cap. The volcanoseismic phenomena associated with the eruption were recorded on both temporary (HOTSPOT) and permanent (SIL) seismic networks, covering most parts of the country. The recorded events were categorised, according to their waveform shape and frequency content, into three groups: (1) low-frequency events; (2) mixed-frequency events; and (3) volcanic tremor. The large earthquake at B\u00e1rdarbunga volcano, which initiated the seismic activity before the eruption, was located inside the caldera and had the characteristics of a non-double couple event. The epicentres of the earthquake swarm that followed it initially delineated the caldera rim and then migrated towards Grimsv\u00f6tn, possibly indicating lateral movements of magma from a shallow chamber beneath B\u00e1rdarbunga. The eruption affected an area much larger than that between these two volcanoes, since seismic activity was also observed at distances 20 km away, at the Tindafjallaj\u00f6kull volcanic system. The spectral analysis of tremor, recorded at the nearest station to the eruption site, revealed its existence before the onset of the eruption in five narrow frequency bands (0.5-0.7, 1.6, 2.2, 2.8, 3.2 Hz) representing fundamental frequencies with their half- and quarter-subharmonics. This pattern continued until the last day of the eruption. It is believed that the eruption was caused by a dyke injection that had been going on beneath the Vatnaj\u00f6kull area for a period of 10 years. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model uses settling velocities calculated for three dominant silt modes (23, 28 and 41 \u03bcm) and measured tidal current data to predict the headward transport of silt by a large flood tide. Modelling was aided by the use of Wind and Currents 2000 (WC2000) freeware, a visualisation and analysis tool for vectorial data. The model predicts the 23, 28 and 41 \u03bcm modes will be transported minimum headward distances of 1250, 950 and 500 m, respectively and compares well with the observed silt distribution on the bed. The results indicate that under fair-weather conditions flood-tides control the distribution of silt. Consistent grain size trends of bulk and siliciclastic silt implies that siliciclastic and carbonate silt-sized grains may exhibit similar hydraulic behaviour during transport by flood tides in Nara Inlet. The model may be applied to embayments where fine sediment transport is dominated by flood tides. It may also have application in identifying the controls on dispersal and accumulation of particle-associated contaminants in embayments characterised by mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sediments.

The existence of such an angle between the crestline of megaripples and sand waves indicates that changes of the (tidal) current direction across sand waves can be expected. Direct evidence that such (tidal) current direction changes occur above sand waves is derived from measurements of the Air-Sea Interaction Drift Buoy (ASIB) system at the sea surface and from side-scan sonar records of the sea bed. Both systems were operated from on board research vessels during two C-STAR field experiments in the Hoek van Holland study area off the Dutch coast in April 1996 and in April 1997. Measurements performed by electrical resistance wires on board the ASIB system indicate that variations of the short and moderate wave direction and the wave directional spread are associated with changes of the (tidal) current direction at the sea surface. According to the results of the measurements derived from the ASIB system and the side-scan sonar records it can be summarised that the variation of the direction of short and moderate period water waves as well as changes of the (tidal) current speed and direction across large sand waves must be considered for correct modelling of the wave-current interaction mechanism.

Abiotic damage (wind, snow, frost or edaphic factors) was present on 8.4% of forest land, on 1.68 million hectares during 1986-1994. It decreased the silvicultural quality of the stand in 5.2% of forest land. Abiotic damage was more frequent in northern than in southern Finland. Especially snow damage was important in northern Finland in Scots pine stands. The defoliation of conifers and various damage forms showed significant co-occurrence. Temporal and spatial patterns were evident in the occurrence and importance of different causal agents. Abiotic damage increased the defoliation in Picea abies more than in Pinus sylvestris, but in the latter species the damage was locally more severe. Sudden changes in defoliation were related to abiotic and biotic damage, and the effect of these injuries can be so remarkable that they mask the possible trend in defoliation. The analysis of these injuries may aid monitoring of forest condition by simplifying interpretation of national and regional patterns of forest damage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

There was also no significant between-group difference when the ~7% smaller forebrain volume among children with DLD was accounted for by relating CC measures to forebrain volume. Only a tendency towards a larger anterior and middle CC in relation to forebrain volume was found in DLD children. In our DLD children we found the same relationship between CC midsagittal size and forebrain volume as recently reported for normal adults, namely, that the CC area increases to the two-third power of forebrain volume.

        "Absrtact": "Global epicentre maps show that the majority of earthquakes are inter-plate, although moderate to large earthquakes do occur intra-plate, i.e. within the plates. The seismicity of the Australian continent is typical of intra-plate environments and a magnitude ML 6 earthquake has an average return period of about 5 years. Recordings of Australian intra-plate earthquakes are investigated here to characterise their frequency content, peak acceleration and duration. Due to lack of quality strong motion records of large intra-plate earthquakes at short distances, synthetic seismograms are commonly used for testing structural behaviour. An empirical Green's Function method (Geophys. Res. Lett. 5 (1978), 1-4: Proceedings of the Third International Microzonation Conference, Seattle, USA. vol. 1. (1982). pp. 447-458.) is chosen to simulate a large earthquake by summation in time of a number of smaller earthquakes or sub-events, each given a slightly different origin time to represent more realistically the propagation of a rupture along an assumed fault plane. In the first instance, recordings on rock of the magnitude ML 2.3 aftershock of the 29 December 1989 Newcastle earthquake were used as sub-events to simulate the main shock of magnitude ML 5.6. Validation studies for events recorded elsewhere in Australia are also considered. The response spectra of such synthetic events will be compared with the recommended spectra developed empirically from a statistical analysis of strong motion data for magnitude 5.4-6.5 intra-plate earthquakes recorded in other parts of the world and normalised to a peak ground velocity of 50 mm/s which is typical for a return period of 500 years in Australia (Australasian Structural Engineering Conference, Auckland. New Zealand. (1998). pp. 439-444.). Preliminary results from this comparison with the response spectra recommended for the Building Code of Australia show that the synthetic waveforms produced by this method are realistic and can be used to represent ground motion during typical Australian intra-plate earthquakes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The descriptor consists of two parts: a perceptual browsing component (PBC) and a similarity retrieval component (SRC). The extraction methods of both PBC and SRC are based on a multiresolution decomposition using Gabor wavelets. PBC provides a quantitative characterization of the texture's structuredness and directionality for browsing application, and the SRC characterizes the distribution of texture energy in different subbands, and supports similarity retrieval. This representation is quite robust to illumination variations and compares favorably with other texture descriptors for similarity retrieval. Experimental results are provided.",

The structure shows an invariant globular core from which a 25 \u00c5 long protrusion emanates, composed of an elongated \u03b1-helix (H10) and a long extended stretch consisting of residues GluB245-ThrB253. A comparison with previous apical domain structures reveals a large segmental displacement of the protruding part of helix H10 via the hinge GluB276-ValB278. The region comprising residues GluB245-ThrB253 adopts an extended \u03b2-like conformation rather than the \u03b1-helix seen in the \u03b1-apical domain. Consequently, it appears that the protrusions of the apical domains from group II chaperonins might assume a variety of context-dependent conformations during an open, substrate-accepting state of the chaperonin. Sequence variations in the protrusion regions that are found in the eukaryotic TRiC/CCT subunits may provide different structural propensities and hence serve different roles in substrate recognition.

        "Absrtact": "Crop performance in rainfed cropping systems generally is dependent on rainfall amount and distribution. The objective of this study was to analyze the long-term consequences of rainfall expressed as a standardized precipitation index (SPI) and fertilizer nitrogen (N) on yields and risk probabilities of maize in the udic-ustic moisture regimes in the Great Plains in Nebraska. The SPI is a precipitation index for classifying drought stress conditions. The study was conducted on a Kennebec silt loam (Cumulic Hapludoll) over an 11-year period, 1986-1996, using monoculture maize (Zea mays L.) and maize in rotation with soybean (Glycine max.(L.) Merr.) in combination with N fertilizer levels between 0 and 160 kg ha-1. Maize yields in monoculture ranged from 4.8 to 5.7 Mg ha-1, and from 6.4 to 6.8 Mg ha-1 in rotation. The differences in yields between monoculture and rotation were larger at low N rates and decreased as N fertilizer increased above 40 kg ha-1. Current year's maize yields either exhibited a weak or no response to N fertilizer in years when the preceding preseason (October-April) and the previous growing season (May-August) were dry (negative SPI value). Regression of yield as the dependent variable and the 12-month April SPI as the independent variable explained up to 64% of yield variability in a curvilinear relationship. Optimum SPI values were in the range of -1.0 to 1.0, substantiating the adaptability and performance of crops under mild stress as proposed by other scientists. Prediction of subsequent yields using past SPI data was relatively better in rotations (R2=41-50%) than in monoculture (R2=15-40%). Risk, calculated as the lower confidence limit of maize returns over variable cost of fertilizer, was less in rotations than in monoculture, and in both cropping systems returns were maximized with the application of N fertilizer at 40 kg ha-1. Used with other criteria, the SPI can be a practical guide to choice of crops, N levels, and management decisions to conserve water in rainfed systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Methods: An inception cohort design was used to analyze Medicaid maternal and infant-linked records and vital records for 41,090 pregnancies from 1995-1998. Results: The relative risk (RR) for mental retardation or developmental delay among infants of mothers with diagnosed urinary tract infections but no antibiotic claims was 1.31 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.12, 1.54 compared with the group without urinary tract infections. The RR for infants of mothers with urinary tract infections without antibiotic claims was 1.22 (95% CI 1.02, 1.46) compared with infants of mothers with urinary tract infections and antibiotic claims. The RR was significant in the first trimester (1.46, 95% CI 1.07, 1.99) and third trimester (1.41, 95% CI 1.11, 1.79) after controlling for race and gestational age at birth. Conclusion: There was a statistically significant association between maternal urinary tract infections without evidence of antibiotics and mental retardation or developmental delay in infants. The relationship persisted when we assumed that over 30% of women who had antibiotic claims filled but did not take the medicine, and 40% of the women who did not have antibiotic claims did take the medication.

Work to enhance the computational infrastructure at DIII-D has included a significant effort to aid the remote collaborator since the DIII-D National Team consists of scientists from nine national laboratories, 19 foreign laboratories, 16 universities, and five industrial partnerships. As a result of this work, DIII-D data is available on a 24\u00d77 basis from a set of viewing and analysis tools that can be run on either the collaborators' or DIII-D's computer systems.

One such etchant class contains chromium trioxide, usually in combination with HF and HNO3. While several ion-chromatographic columns can be used to analyze most mineral acids, chromium(VI) presents a problem. This latter species is highly retained by many separators and may also degrade the resins. This paper compares two columns that showed potential for success with these assays: the AS11 and the AS16 separators (both from Dionex). These columns permit elution of chromium(VI) as chromate in 25 min or less. A representative mixture of HF, HNO3 and CrO3 was used in the research. Simultaneous calibration studies were conducted and the data sets analyzed statistically. Also investigated was the effect on the columns of repeated exposure to chromate.

We studied the relative predictive value for cardiac death of 3 commonly applied noninvasive strategies, clinical assessment, stress electrocardiography, and myocardial perfusion tomography, in a large, multicenter population of stable angina patients. The multicenter observational series comprised 7 community and academic medical centers and 8,411 stable chest pain patients. All patients underwent pretest clinical screening followed by stress (exercise 84% or pharmacologic 16%) electrocardiography and myocardial perfusion tomography. Risk-adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were developed to predict cardiac death. Kaplan-Meier rates of time to cardiac catheterization were also computed. Cardiac mortality was 3% during the 2.5 \u00b1 1.5 years of follow-up. The number of infarcted vascular territories and pretest clinical risk factors were strong predictors of cardiac mortality, whereas the number of ischemic vascular territories gained increasing importance when determining post-test resource use requirements (i.e., the decision to perform cardiac catheterization). Exertional ST-segment depression in a population with a high frequency of electrocardiographic abnormalities at rest was not a significant differentiator of cardiac death risk. Stable chest pain patients are accurately identified as being at high risk for near-term cardiac events by both physicians' screening clinical evaluation and by the results of stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Disease management strategies for stable chest pain patients aimed at risk reduction should incorporate knowledge of relevant end points in treatment and guideline development.

        "Absrtact": "The fossil diatom record from Elk Lake (Grant County, Minnesota) was used to reconstruct salinity and brine type between 2640 and 4645 14 C yr BP. This lake was selected for a brine-type reconstruction because a previous study using fossil-ostracode assemblages indicated a shift in anion composition during the mid-Holocene (Smith et al., 1997). Salinity was reconstructed using a transfer function developed for the Northern Great Plains (NGP) of North America; the reconstruction revealed that salinity was higher (1.5-6.2 g l -1 ) between ~4000 and 4645 14 C yr BP and dropped to 0.35-1.2 g l -1 after 4000 14 C yr BP. The anion composition of the system was investigated by passively plotting fossil diatom assemblages onto a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) biplot of the NGP modern samples to determine where core assemblages fell with respect to brine type. The biplot suggests that Elk Lake was mainly a bicarbonate system, but temporarily shifted to sulfate domination at 4080 14 C yr BP. Both the salinity and brine-type reconstructions essentially agree with results from Smith et al. (1997), but the diatom record provides less-definitive information on anion proportions as compared to anion concentrations. Because shifts in the relative abundances of anion-associated diatom taxa generally tracked the ostracode-inferred changes in brine type, we conclude that fossil diatom assemblages can reveal information on shifts in brine type over time and provide insight into brine evolution and groundwater behavior in a lake system.

Interactions of tomato cutin with water were examined by solid-state 2H and 13C NMR, showing that water films enhance rapid segmental motions of the acyl chains and are associated with a fivefold increase in surface elasticity upon cutin hydration. The suberization of wounded potato tissues was studied by solid-state 13C NMR, revealing the likely phenylpropanoid structures that permit dense cross-linking of the suberin structure and their proximity to the cell-wall polysaccharides. Finally, two new approaches were developed to elucidate the molecular structures of these biopolymers: partial depolymerization followed by spectroscopic analysis of the soluble oligomers; and swelling of the intact materials followed by magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR analysis. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Paper birch, which formed the dominant overstory following the 1961 fire, had normal distributions of height and diameter classes. Subalpine fir, which dominated the understory, had the reverse J-shaped height and diameter distributions that are expected of a shade tolerant, climax species. Paper birch grew more than three times the height of subalpine fir. Growing in the summer shade of the birch, subalpine fir had slow but steady height growth during the first 10-15 years, after which height growth declined somewhat. Allometric equations, relating dry weight of foliage, branches, stemwood, stembark, roots, and total biomass to diameter at breast height (DBH), were developed to estimate above- and below-ground biomass. Total biomass of paper birch reached 83.2 t ha-1, while subalpine fir biomass was 26.7 t ha-1. Subalpine fir allocated more biomass to foliage and branches compared to paper birch. Foliage of paper birch had higher nutrient concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg than subalpine fir foliage. Branches and stembark of subalpine fir had higher P, and Ca concentrations than paper birch. Subalpine fir branches contained more of all examined nutrients than paper birch branches. This is a significant component in nutrient cycling of the mixed-species forest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We determined the crystal structures of rat heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-heme and selenomethionyl HO-1-heme complexes. Heme is sandwiched between two helices with the \u03b4-meso edge of the heme being exposed to the surface. Gly143N forms a hydrogen bond to the distal ligand of heme, OH-. The distance between Gly143N and the ligand is shorter than that in the human HO-1-heme complex. This difference may be related to a pH-dependent change of the distal ligand of heme. Flexibility of the distal helix may control the stability of the coordination of the distal ligand to heme iron. The possible role of Gly143 in the heme oxygenase reaction is discussed.

Thirty three (38%) houses had at least one contaminated sample and were classified as Salmonella-contaminated houses in the logistic regression. The absence of a terminal disinfection and a disinfection procedure performed by the farm staff rather than a contractor were positively related to the Salmonella contamination of the house after cleansing and disinfection. The risk for Salmonella persistence after decontamination was increased if rodents were observed by the farmer, if a large part of the access area to the house was accessible to trucks, and if a disease leading to a treatment occurred in the previous flock.

The intergenomic coevolution of interacting gene products has been previously suggested based on interspecific comparisons of cytochrome c (encoded by the nuclear CYC gene) and cytochrome c oxidase (partly encoded in the mitochondrial DNA by the COX1, COX2 and COX3 genes). In the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus californicus, non-synonymous substitutions in the COX1 gene have previously been found in interpopulation comparisons. In order to determine if CYC also shows interpopulation variation, this gene was isolated from a cDNA library using a degenerate primer/polymerase chain reaction approach. Characterization of a cDNA sequence and 25 genomic DNA sequences derived from four T. californicus populations yielded the following results: (1) the T. californicus CYC gene is interrupted by an intron that occurs at the same position as the intron found in vertebrate CYC genes; (2) there is extensive sequence variation within both the coding region and intron of this gene and the vast majority of this variation occurs between sequences drawn from geographically distinct populations; (3) the coding sequence variation includes a minimum of five amino acid replacement substitutions; (4) segregation of length variants among offspring in an interpopulation cross revealed genotypic ratios consistent with the proposed allelic nature of the CYC variants. These results demonstrate that the requisite genetic variation required for intergenomic coevolution exists in the CYC-COX system in T. californicus. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although the TRISS methodology, a logistic regression modelling technique, is still the de facto standard, it is known that neural network models perform better. A key issue when applying neural network models is the selection of input variables. This paper proposes a novel form of sensitivity analysis, which is simpler to apply than existing techniques, and can be used for both numeric and nominal input variables. The technique is applied to the audit survival problem, and used to analyse the TRISS variables. The conclusions discuss the implications for the design of further improved scoring schemes and predictive models. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

The comparison of the four possible models of the stacked disk with the data shows that there is a better correlation of the data with the left-handed model built from the A-A ring pair coordinates than with the two models involving the A-B ring pair, or with the right-handed model of the A-A ring pair. This establishes that the packing of the protein subunits in the stacked disk is different from that previously believed. We also note some differences between the observed structure and A-A ring pair model in the region of the flexible loop at small radius that might be an indication of conformational differences that give rise to the stability of the aggregate.

Growing human populations are placing increasing demands for new lands for agricultural production. At the same time, there is a need to maintain or increase our forest cover for biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Unfortunately, our land base is limited. Consequently, there is strong competition between those lands will be used for forestry and those that will be used for agriculture. Current assessments of agriculture and forested lands are often carried out by separate entities. Often, there is duplication of data collection, information gaps, etc. The bottom line is that we do not really know how much land currently serves the needs of agriculture and forestry, which lands are best suited for conversion to alternate use, and where they are located. In order for decision makers to make more informed decisions, we need complete and up-to-date geo-referenced inventories.

In the present study, 180 pregnant women and 178 newborn babies were studied, amounting to 36% of the total number of births in the Disko Bay area during 1994-1996. The pesticides found in the highest concentrations in maternal blood were DDE (4.8 \u03bcg/l wet wt.), trans-nonachlor (1.6 \u03bcg/l) and hexachlorobenzene (1.2 \u03bcg/l) while the total concentration of PCB (Aroclor 1260) was 19.1 \u03bcg/l. Calculated on a lipid basis, concentrations were slightly higher in maternal than in cord blood. The mercury concentrations were 16.8 \u03bcg/l in maternal blood and 35.6 \u03bcg/l in cord blood. In a linear regression analysis, the concentrations of organochlorines, mercury and selenium increased with maternal age. Concentrations of mercury and cadmium increased with the consumption of marine mammals, and cadmium was associated with smoking. The contaminants are potentially toxic for several organ systems but the high concentrations of pollutants have so far not been shown to influence health in Greenland.

The other investigated compounds have the same structure. Magnetization was measured in the temperature range 1.5-300 K, and, except for the Dy compound, the resistivity was studied between 4 and 300 K. Moreover, the specific heat of the Er and Lu compounds was studied between 1.2 and 30 K. All compounds with magnetic rare earths order antiferromagnetically below their Neel temperature, which ranges from 3 K (R = Tm) to 27 K (R = Gd). Below TN, metamagnetic transitions are observed. In the compound with Er, the specific heat reveals that, immediately below TN = 8.8 K, there is a second transition at 8.5 K. The intermediate phase is likely a modulated structure.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: When we view static scenes that imply motion - such as an object dropping off a shelf - recognition memory for the position of the object is extrapolated forward. It is as if the object in our mind's eye comes alive and continues on its course. This phenomenon is known as representational momentum and results in a distortion of recognition memory in the implied direction of motion. Representational momentum is modifiable; simply labelling a drawing of a pointed object as 'rocket' will facilitate the effect, whereas the label 'steeple' will impede it. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural substrate for representational momentum. Results: Subjects participated in two experiments. In the first, they were presented with video excerpts of objects in motion (versus the same objects in a resting position). This identified brain areas responsible for motion perception. In the second experiment, they were presented with still photographs of the same target items, only some of which implied motion (representational momentum stimuli). When viewing still photographs of scenes implying motion, activity was revealed in secondary visual cortical regions that overlap with areas responsible for the perception of actual motion. Additional bilateral activity was revealed within a posterior satellite of V5 for the representational momentum stimuli. Activation was also engendered in the anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: Considering the implicit nature of representational momentum and its modifiability, the findings suggest that higher-order semantic information can act on secondary visual cortex to alter perception without explicit awareness.",

Hypofrontality in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during higher order motor control: a study using fMRI. Am J Psychiatry 1999;156(6):891-896] could be attributed to delayed maturation of frontal cortex. Brain activation of 17 healthy subjects, 9 adolescents and 8 young adults, during performance of a motor response inhibition task and a motor timing task was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The effect of age on brain activation was estimated, using the analysis of variance and regression, at both voxel and regional levels. In the delay task, superior performance in adults was paralleled by a significantly increased power of response in a network comprising prefrontal and parietal cortical regions and putamen. In the stop task, alternative neuronal routes - left hemispheric prefrontal regions in adults and right hemispheric opercular frontal cortex and caudate in adolescents - seem to have been recruited by the two groups for achieving comparable performances. A significant age effect was found for the prefrontal activation in both task, confirming the hypothesis of a dysmaturational pathogenesis for the hypofrontality in ADHD.

Two-hundred and thirty eight cases and 491 hospitalized controls were frequency matched on age, sex, residence and urban/rural status. Both series were submitted to a detailed questionnaire, including tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and queries on 64 food items. These data were analyzed by unconditional logistic regression, after adjusting by total energy intake. Tomato intake was associated with a reduction in risk of 0.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.51), whereas tomato sauce-rich foods displayed a protective effect of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.33-0.96 for the highest quartile of intake). The food group composed of raw tomato and tomato-rich foods showed a strong inverse association with UADC (odds ratio [OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.13-0.39 for the highest quartile of intake). Lycopene was also strongly associated with a reduced risk of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.13-0.37). Adjustment of tomato intake for several phytochemicals explained almost completely its protective effect, which disappears in this model. Finally, the joint effect of lycopene and total phytosterols was associated with a significant reduction in risk (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05-0.23). Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The specimens were assessed for the ability to grow in vitro (colony forming efficiency, CFE) and inherent radiosensitivity measured as the surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) using a soft-agar clonogenic assay. Patients were treated mainly with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy usually as a combination of accelerated external beam and interstitial radiotherapy. The probabilities of local control and survival were analyzed by univariate, bivariate and Cox multivariate analyses.Results: Successful growth was achieved in 110/156 specimens and SF2 values were obtained from 99/156. Eighty four out of these patients underwent radical treatment. The median SF2 value for the 84 tumors was 0.40. At a mean follow-up time of 25 months (range 7-65) the median SF2 value of tumors from 14 patients who developed local recurrence was 0.53, which was significantly higher than the median of 0.38 for tumors from 70 patients without local recurrence (p = 0.015). Tumor SF2 was a significant prognostic factor for local control (p = 0.036), but not for overall survival (p = 0.20). Tumor SF2 was an independent prognostic factor for local control within bivariate and Cox multivariate analyses.Conclusions: This study has shown that tumor radiosensitivity measured as SF2 is a significant prognostic factor for local control in head and neck cancers.

The calculated surface structure is in reasonable agreement with previous plane wave density functional and empirical tight binding calculations but is significantly different to either of the proposed structures based on LEED-IV experiments. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy with the LEED-IV results. The current calculations also reveal that the (001) termination has a significantly higher surface energy than the (100) or (110) surfaces confirming that it is the least stable low index termination of rutile TiO2. Finally, we examine the electronic structure of the relaxed surface and find no evidence for the presence of band gap states as reported in early photoemission experiments and tight binding calculations. The current results suggest that such states will only occur on the defective surface and are likely to be localised Ti3+ states induced by oxygen reduction.",

Nine male control subjects (mean age = 41.6) and 15 male cocaine users (mean age = 43.2) were tested, the latter after heavy cocaine use ranging from 4 to 27 years (mean age = 16.7). Cocaine users had been cocaine free for four days to six months (mean = 17 days) at testing. Cocaine users exhibited a 68% reduction in startle amplitudes (F = 7.4; df = 1,22; p < .01) compared to controls. There were trends towards increased PPI in cocaine users under certain conditions; however, there were no significant main effects.

        "Absrtact": "The mutation load of the pathogenic LHON (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy) mtDNA mutation at nucleotide 3460 has been followed over time in the WBC/platelet fraction from members of a matrilineal pedigree. Longitudinal analysis over a sampling period of five to six years indicates that, in all five heteroplasmic family members, the mutation load decreases at a mean overall rate of approximately 1% per year. There was no change in mutation load in homoplasmic wildtype or in homoplasmic mutant individuals. For the purposes of comparison, a longitudinal analysis of a silent mtDNA polymorphism at nucleotide 14560 was also carried out for members of a second matrilineal pedigree. In contrast to the results for the pathogenic mtDNA mutation, there was no change in the proportion of the silent polymorphism in the WBC/platelet fraction of four family members over a period of seven years. These results indicate that the pathogenic 3460 LHON mutation segregates under negative selection in these cell populations. One possible mechanism through which selection may operate is that, in heteroplasmic individuals, the hematopoietic stem cells are generally homoplasmic, either for the wildtype or for the mutant allele. The homoplasmic mutant stem cells, because of their mitochondrial respiratory chain defect, produce fewer mature WBCs and platelets over time than do the wildtype stem cells. Alternatively, the stem cells may be heteroplasmic and selection may act to favor proliferation of mitochondria with lower levels of the pathogenic mutation in the WBC/platelet cell populations.

The three-dimensional structures of the oxidised and reduced Desulfovibrio gigas cytochrome c3 in solution were solved using 2D 1H-NMR data. The reduced protein structures were calculated using INDYANA, an extended version of DYANA that allows automatic calibration of NOE data. The oxidised protein structure, which includes four paramagnetic centres, was solved using the program PARADYANA, which also includes the structural paramagnetic parameters. In this case, initial structures were used to correct the upper and lower volume restraints for paramagnetic leakage, and angle restraints derived from 13C Fermi contact shifts of haem moiety substituents were used for the axial histidine ligands. Despite the reduction of the NOE intensities by paramagnetic relaxation, the final family of structures is of similar precision and accuracy to that obtained for the reduced form. Comparison of the two structures shows that, although the global folds of the two families of structures are similar, significant localised differences occur upon change of redox state, some of which could not be detected by comparison with the X-ray structure of the oxidised state: (1) there is a redox-linked concerted rearrangement of Lys80 and Lys90 that results in the stabilisation of haem moieties II and III when both molecules are oxidised or both are reduced, in agreement with the previously measured positive redox cooperativity between these two haem moieties. This cooperativity regulates electron transfer, enabling a two-electron step adapted to the function of cytochromes c3 as the coupling partner of hydrogenase; and (2) the movement of haem I propionate 13 towards the interior of the protein upon reduction explains the positive redox-Bohr effect, establishing the structural basis for the redox-linked proton activation mechanism necessary for energy conservation, driving ATP synthesis.

        "Absrtact": "The Colorado Plateau is a distinct physiographic province in western North America, which presently straddles the transition between summer-wet and summer-dry climatic regimes to the south and northwest, respectively. In addition to climate, the diversity of environments and plant communities on the Colorado Plateau has resulted from extreme topographic diversity. Desert lowlands as low as 360 m elevation are surrounded by forested plateaus, and even higher peaks greater than 3800 m elevation. This environmental diversity provides a unique opportunity to study the history of biotic communities in an arid region of North America. Although the Colorado Plateau harbours numerous potential sites, the paleoecological record of the Plateau is poorly known. Potential deposits for analysis include packrat middens, alluvial and cave sites at lower elevations, and lake, bog and wetland sites at higher elevations. Forty-six sites have been analysed across the nearly 337,000 km2 region, of which 27 contain records that span Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (IS) 2 data, with IS 3 information coming from only 12 sites. Most IS 2 and 3 sites are clustered along the lowland regions of the Colorado River corridor and the uplands of the Mogollon Rim area. We compiled selected data from long paleoecological records to examine patterns of vegetation and climate change across the southern Colorado Plateau for the middle and late Wisconsin. During the middle Wisconsin, mixed conifers covered middle-elevations presently dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and juniper (Juniperus) woodland grew at elevations today covered by blackbrush (Coleogyne) and sagebrush (Artemisia) desert. During the late Wisconsin, boreal conifers, primarily Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), replaced the mixed conifer association. Estimates of mean annual temperatures (MAT) during IS 3 were at least 3-4\u00b0C cooler than today, whereas IS 2 MAT estimates are at least 5\u00b0C colder. Our investigation of millennial-scale climatic variability within the region provided equivocal results. The packrat midden sequence could not distinguish vegetation changes that might be associated with Heinrich events in the North Atlantic. From the lake records, however, many Heinrich events were associated with generally drier intervals, often with elevated sagebrush pollen concentrations. Future paleoecological investigations should concentrate on the northern Colorado Plateau, as well as the eastern and western margins. Additional sites, along with closer-spaced sampling in regions already studied, will be important in determining the history of important climatic phenomena such as the timing of the Arizona monsoon.",

Independently of the relative teleseismic travel time residuals, the Bouguer gravity anomalies were used as an additional aid to examine the structure of the crust and upper mantle. An examination of the teleseismic travel time residuals in Israel suggests the existence of two prominent provinces of distinct crustal structure. The northward increase of the teleseismic travel time residuals is in good agreement with a gradual thickening of the sedimentary sequence and a simultaneous thinning of the crust. Examination of the inverted velocity anomalies indicates that the upper and lower crusts are sub-divided into a number of structures. We identify several velocity anomalies that are associated with prominent geological structures. The southern Dead Sea basin is characterized with the largest decrease of velocity, in both upper and lower crustal layers, due to the infilling of light material relative to the surrounding material. The velocity anomaly in the Carmel structure is probably associated with variations in the upper part of the upper mantle. Examination of a cross-section that traverses the Dead Sea transform supports the existence of lighter mass density material on the eastern side relative to that on the western side. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Its primary objective was to compile a comprehensive experimental database to improve the mechanistic understanding of tree/crop interactions and support the development and validation of process-based simulation models describing resource capture and tree and crop growth in semi-arid agroforestry systems. Grevillea robusta A. Cunn. (grevillea) trees were grown as mono-cultures or in mixtures with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) or maize (Zea mays L.) over a 68-month period. Allometric approaches were used to determine seasonal and annual growth increments for leaf area and leaf, branch and trunk biomass in grevillea. Crop performance was examined during each growing season, while the spatial distribution of tree and crop roots was established during the latter stages of the experiment using coring and mini-rhizotron approaches. Detailed hydrological studies examined effects on the soil water balance and its components (precipitation, interception, runoff and soil moisture status); equivalent measurements of spatial and temporal variation in microclimatic conditions allowed the mechanistic basis for beneficial and detrimental effects on understorey crops and the influence of proximity to trees on crop performance to be examined. Transpiration by grevillea and water movement through lateral and tap roots were measured using sap flow methodology, and light interception by the tree and crop canopies was routinely determined. This multi-disciplinary study has provided a detailed understanding of the changing patterns of resource capture by trees and crops as agroforestry systems mature. This paper provides an overview of the underlying rationale, experimental design and core measurements, outlines key results and conclusions, and draws the attention of readers to further papers providing more detailed consideration of specific aspects of the study.

The section has the physical properties of seismic layer 3, and a total magnetization sufficient by itself to account for the overlying lineated sea-surface magnetic anomaly. The rocks from Hole 735B are principally olivine gabbro, with evidence for two principal and many secondary intrusive events. There are innumerable late small ferrogabbro intrusions, often associated with shear zones that cross-cut the olivine gabbros. The ferrogabbros dramatically increase upward in the section. Whereas there are many small patches of ferrogabbro representing late iron- and titanium-rich melt trapped intragranularly in olivine gabbro, most late melt was redistributed prior to complete solidification by compaction and deformation. This, rather than in situ upward differentiation of a large magma body, produced the principal igneous stratigraphy. The computed bulk composition of the hole is too evolved to mass balance mid-ocean ridge basalt back to a primary magma, and there must be a significant mass of missing primitive cumulates. These could lie either below the hole or out of the section. Possibly the gabbros were emplaced by along-axis intrusion of moderately differentiated melts into the near-transform environment. Alteration occurred in three stages. High-temperature granulite- to amphibolite-facies alteration is most important, coinciding with brittle-ductile deformation beneath the ridge. Minor greenschist-facies alteration occurred under largely static conditions, likely during block uplift at the ridge transform intersection. Late post-uplift low-temperature alteration produced locally abundant smectite, often in previously unaltered areas. The most important features of the high- and low-temperature alteration are their respective associations with ductile and cataclastic deformation, and an overall decrease downhole with hydrothermal alteration generally \u2264 5% in the bottom kilometer. Hole 735B provides evidence for a strongly heterogeneous lower ocean crust, and for the inherent interplay of deformation, alteration and igneous processes at slow-spreading ridges. It is strikingly different from gabbros sampled from fast-spreading ridges and at most well-described ophiolite complexes. We attribute this to the remarkable diversity of tectonic environments where crustal accretion occurs in the oceans and to the low probability of a section of old slow-spread crust formed near a major large-offset transform being emplaced on-land compared to sections of young crust from small ocean basins.

The system, known as the Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM), consists of a 1\u00b0x 1\u00b0 resolution numerical ocean model driven by surface fluxes from the UKMO numerical weather prediction (NWP) suite and a modified successive correction data assimilation scheme for thermal observations. The assimilation scheme is assessed here in a series of 1-year integrations by comparison with 'independent' thermal profile observations and climatology. Assimilating temperature observations significantly reduces model errors in the upper ocean and results in temperature analyses that on average are closer to independent observations than climatology. The specific results depend on location and depth. The extent to which the data assimilation scheme is able to compensate for uncertainties in the surface forcing fluxes is also assessed by comparing integrations forced with climatological and NWP fluxes. Assimilating data is able to compensate for uncertainties in the surface heat forcing fluxes and significantly reduces the impact from uncertainties in the surface wind stress.

        "Absrtact": "Seventeen eastern Mediterranean Pliocene sapropels from ODP Sites 964, 966, 967 and 969, some of which are coeval, have been analysed for their geochemistry. The sapropels are characterized by very high organic carbon contents (up to 30%) which are reported to be the result of both increased productivity and improved preservation. Although the organic matter in the sapropels is mainly of marine origin, the \u03b4 13 C(org) values and C/N ratios appear 'terrestrial'. This is the result of anaerobic organic matter degradation which preferentially removed nitrogen- and 13 C-rich organic components. A comparison with Ti/Al profiles, which mimic the precession index, and a calculation of organic carbon accumulation rates indicate that sedimentation rates were at most 30% lower or at most 50% higher during sapropel formation. Thus, sapropel formation lasted from between 2000 and 10,000 years at Site 964 to between 4500 and 12,000 years at Site 967. A synthesis of new data and a comparison with existing models indicates that productivity, which increased due to extra nutrients supplied as a result of winter mixing and as a result of enhanced input by the Nile, was the driving mechanism behind sapropel formation. The resulting sapropel formation was simultaneous at different depths, but lasted longer in the part of the basin closest to the Nile. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Exon skipping that accompanies exonic mutation might be caused by an effect of the mutation on pre-mRNA secondary structure. Previous attempts to associate predicted secondary structure of pre-mRNA with exon skipping have been hindered by either a small number of available mutations, sub-optimal structures, or weak effects on exon skipping. This report identifies more extensive sets of mutations from the human and hamster Hprt gene whose association with exon skipping is clear. Optimal secondary structures of the wild-type and mutant pre-mRNA surrounding each exon were predicted by energy minimization and were compared by energy dot plots. A significant association was found between the occurrence of exon skipping and the disruption of a stem containing the acceptor site consensus sequences of exon 8 of the human Hprt gene. However, no change in secondary structure was associated with skipping of exon 4 of the hamster Hprt gene. Using updated energy parameters we found a different structure than that previously reported for exon 2 of the hamster Hprt gene. In contrast to the previously reported structure, no significant association was found between predicted structural changes and skipping of exon 2. For all three Hprt exons studied, there was a significantly greater number of deoxythymidine substitutions among mutations accompanied by exon skipping than among mutations without exon skipping. For exon 8, deoxythymidine substitution was also associated with structural changes in the stem containing the acceptor site consensus sequences. For exon 51 of the human fibrillin gene, structural differences from wild type were predicted for all four mutations accompanied by exon skipping that were not were predicted for a single mutation without exon skipping. Our results suggest that both primary and secondary pre-mRNA structure contribute to definition of Hprt exons, which may involve exonic splicing enhancers. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

No previous work had been conducted on current or historical deposition of POPs in Lake Winnipeg sediments. Analysis by high resolution gas chromatography-electron capture detection showed elevated PCB concentrations in sediments dated to the late 1960s to early 1970s. Recent PCB fluxes were estimated to be 5 to 11\u03bcg/m2/y in Lake Winnipeg sediments, with burdens of 388 and 337 \u03bcg/m2 in the north and south basins, respectively. Loadings in the north basin sediment indicated atmospheric sources; south basin sediment reflected inputs from agricultural, industrial, and urban activities. DDT inventories were 37 and 127 \u03bcg/m2 in the north and south basin cores, respectively. DDD contributed the largest amount to DDT in sediments, corresponding to anaerobic degradation of the parent molecule. Maximum hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) concentrations were observed in recent slices of both sediment cores and fluxes ranged from 177 to 914 ng/m2/y. There was evidence for recent increases in lindane deposition. Subsurface maximum concentrations were observed for total chlordane (\u03a3CHL), pentachloroanisole (PCA), and total chlorobenzenes (\u03a3CBz) in the south basin. \u03a3CHL, PCA, and \u03a3CBz, however, were present at maximum concentrations in the surface slice in sediment from the north basin.",

        "Absrtact": "The knowledge of the primordial deuterium to hydrogen ratio provides one of the most reliable tests of the early Universe nucleosynthesis models and a direct estimate of the cosmic baryon density. Evaluations have been traditionally made using D/H estimations in the interstellar medium, extrapolated backwards in time with the use of galactic evolution models. Direct primordial D/H measurements have been carried out only recently in the direction of quasars. These measurements of deuterium abundances along with observations made in the solar system and in the interstellar medium are presented. New results that indicate spatial variations of the deuterium abundance in the interstellar medium at the level of \u223c 50% over scales possibly as small as \u223c 10 pc, may question our global vision of deuterium evolution until the causes for the origin of these variations are understood. With a conservative point of view, observations thus suggest that the primordial D/H value should be within the range 1. \u00d7 10-5 -3. \u00d7 10-4, leading to a relatively low baryon content Universe. Since the actual evolution of deuterium from primordial nucleosynthesis to now is not known in details, more observations, hopefully to be made with the Hubble Space Telescope, FUSE the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (launched in 1999), or from the ground with the largest telescopes (Keck, VLT, ...), should reveal the evolution of that key element, and better constrain its primordial abundance.",

A slightly landward dipping interface revealed at 13 km depth by a single previous line in the channel between Cephalonia and Zante has been suggested as the interplate subduction boundary. New marine multichannel reflection profiles and OBS refraction and wide-angle reflection data confirm the reflector as a regional feature. These data evidence its extension to the south, where large, low-angle thrust earthquakes occur offshore to Zante. The new profiles establish a coincidence between the focal depths of these large subduction events and the imaged bright reflective level, confirming its tentative interpretation as the interplate boundary, which generally appears with a positive reflection polarity. In this context, the Ionian Islands outcrop corresponds to a shallowing of the interplate boundary from south to north. In the south, offshore Zante, the interplate boundary comprises a stratified zone that may be considered as the sedimentary cover of the Ionian Basin oceanic-like crust, which forms the lower plate here. The shallower position and single-cycle reflection character of the interplate further north suggest that the lower plate could there be the Apulian paleomargin to that basin. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In most cases, a great part of the material collected by traps (200 and 540 m depth) was biogenic, opal being the most abundant constituent followed by organic matter. The composition of particles shows a seasonal pattern in the upper trap, which is much less evident at depth. Fluxes showed a marked seasonality due to the presence, in winter, of ice cover. During the sampling period, mass fluxes varied from 0.03 to 120 mg m-2 day-1 and from 24 to 393 mg m-2 day-1 at the upper and bottom level, respectively. Values of 0-64 mg m-2 day-1 of biogenic silica and 0-7.8 mg m-2 day-1 of organic carbon were obtained at 200 m depth. Near-bottom fluxes were almost always much higher: 11-141 and 1.5-19 mg m-2 day-1, respectively. 210Pb fluxes are lower than expected, and this means that particles sink rapidly without reaching an equilibrium with the radiotracer. A mechanism of focusing affects the bottom trap and much more, the seafloor. At site B, we measured particle fluxes that are much lower than those obtained at other locations in the Ross Sea. This can be due to low production and export during the sampling period, and underlies the necessity to further investigate the interannual variability of these processes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In order to predict the molecular functions of the orfs, a position-specific iterated (PSI)-BLAST search of bacteriophage T4 against the sequence database of known 3D structures was carried out. PSI-BLAST is one of the most powerful iterative sequence search methods using multiple sequence alignment, with the ability to detect many more proteins with distant homology than standard pairwise methods. The 3D structures of proteins are considered to be better preserved than the sequences, and the detected distantly homologous proteins are likely to possess highly similar 3D structures. Thirteen orfs of phage T4, whose homologues were not detected by standard pairwise methods, were found to have significantly homologous counterparts by this method. The plausibility of the results was confirmed by checking whether important residues at substrate/ligand-binding sites were conserved. Among them, two orfs, vs.1 and e.1, which are similar to Escherichia coli lytic enzyme and MutT protein, respectively, had not been studied previously. Also, gp rIIA, a rapid lysis protein, whose gene structure had been intensively studied during the development of molecular biology in the 1950s and yet whose molecular function remains unknown, has an N-terminal domain that is significantly similar to the N-terminal region of the heat shock protein Hsp90. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Three different treatments were used for each smectite, thus providing six samples for evaluation. The thermal and catalytic decomposition of HDPE was studied under isothermal (60 min at 420\u00b0C) and dynamic (35-650\u00b0C at 10\u00b0C min-1) conditions. The thermal decomposition of HDPE yielded characteristic quartets of peaks in the chromatogram which were assigned to n-alkanes, l-alkenes, x-alkenes and \u03b1, \u03c9-dienes in the range C4-C22. Species of higher molecular weight than C22 were not detected. All six catalysts converted the alkenes present in the thermally generated off gases into light gases and aromatic species. Mono-, di- and trimethylbenzenes were the most abundant aromatic species although small quantities of ethylbenzenes and naphthalenes were produced. More aromatics were produced at 420\u00b0C than at temperatures up to 650\u00b0C, whereas the reverse was true for branched alkanes. The total conversion of HDPE increased with both the extent of acid treatment and the process temperature, whereas the proportion of aromatics produced was greatest for catalysts prepared using short acid-treatment times. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A GIS algorithm has been applied to analyse the maximum potential extent that lava flows can reach in order to delimit the areas topographically protected against flow invasion. The algorithm selected makes use of a special kind of spatial analysis functions called neighbourhood operators, in which the outcome depends on the values that one or more specified variables adopt in the surroundings of the element where analysis takes place. Assuming the maximum magnitude hypothesis, potential lava flow invasion areas can be calculated with spatial analysis functions in the context of two propagation regimes: persistent flow lengthening, and a combination of persistent flow lengthening and widening. To define the algorithm behaviour for each regime, a series of simple stochastic rules have been set to establish the way in which lava flow propagation can proceed. The algorithm has been applied on three source areas located in Tenerife Island characterised by their high probability of occurrence of basic effusive events. For each area, maximum potential flow extent has been calculated following both propagation regimes, with the aim of delimiting the areas that would potentially remain out of lava reach. No distance limits have been taken into account to carry out the calculation, as lava has on many occasions reached the coastline either in historic or geologic times. An additional hazard exposure level analysis has been possible in those areas where results indicated that flows could potentially arrive from more than one source. Algorithm performance assessment has been carried out in terms of accuracy by generating a series of 3D views and comparing the algorithm application results with those obtained from stochastic physical model simulation. Although the GIS algorithm applied does not distinguish the probability level of an area being invaded by lava, it has clearly identified on Tenerife the areas which are potentially safe from the flows that could originate at any point located inside or on the margins of each of the source areas considered. This capability can be advantageously used to develop medium-to long-term risk prevention and management measures. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Intracellular and field potential recordings were taken from the lateral nucleus of the amygdala in a rat horizontal brain slice preparation that included hippocampal formation. Pyramidal cells comprised the majority of labeled cells (77%). Electrophysiological classification based on hyperpolarizing or depolarizing afterpotentials subdivided both the pyramidal and non-pyramidal cell classes, although pyramidal cells tended to have hyperpolarizing afterpotentials (70%) and non-pyramidal cells tended to have depolarizing afterpotentials (63%). Synchronous population bursts were triggered with single extracellular stimuli in the deep layers of entorhinal cortex. These events propagated from deep layers of entorhinal cortex into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Latencies were consistent with a direct entorhinal to amygdala projection. Individual lateral nucleus neurons exhibited responses ranging from a long burst response that included an initial period of 200 Hz firing and a tail of gamma frequency firing lasting over 100 ms (grade 1) to an epsp with no firing (grade 4). Half of pyramidal cells responding to events initiated in entorhinal cortex were found to receive epsps strong enough to trigger firing. Only one stellate neuron fired in response to entorhinal stimulation. Excitatory postsynaptic responses included NMDA and non-NMDA receptor mediated components. We demonstrate that synchronous population events can propagate from entorhinal cortex to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and that pyramidal neurons of the lateral nucleus are more common targets than stellate neurons. We conclude that other synchronous events such as sharp waves and interictal spikes can spread from entorhinal cortex to amygdala in the same manner. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In each subject, rCBF and rCMRGlc were measured in sequence, during the same session. Both rCBF and rCMRGlc values were found to decrease from young (mean rCBF=43.7 ml/100 g per min; mean rCMRGlc=40.6 \u03bcmol/100 g per min) to old age (mean rCBF=37.3 ml/100 g per min; mean rCMRGlc=35.2 \u03bcmol/100 g per min), resulting in a drop over 40 years of 14.8% (0.37%/year) and 13.3% (0.34%/year), respectively. On a regional basis, the frontal and the visual cortices were observed to have, respectively, the highest and the lowest reduction in rCBF, while, for rCMRGlc, these extremes were observed in striatum and cerebellum. Despite these differences, the ratio of rCBF to rCMRGlc was found to have a similar behavior in all brain regions for young and old subjects as shown by a correlation coefficient of 88%. This comparative study indicates a decline in rCBF and rCMRGlc values and a coupling between CBF and CMRGlc as a function of age. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The study of these phenomena therefore needs an accurate representation of the atmosphere/ocean interface generally occupied by the ice pack. With this aim in view, a one-dimensional thermodynamic model based on Semtner's approach associated with a horizontal transport component is used to compute the sea ice thickness and extent. A visco-plastic ice rheology reproduces the ridging of the ice pack. Turbulent surface heat and momentum fluxes over ice and open areas are classically computed. The sea ice and leads are connected to the deep ocean through a mixed layer. The heat and salt fluxes between ice and water column are explicitly taken into account. The model is run with a set of climatological data to reproduce the ice formation during a year and the results are compared with available observations. This work is the first step of a coupled ocean circulation/sea ice model developed for the Southern Ocean. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A thorough understanding of fault seal processes is important in many practical and geological applications, which depend on subsurface flow of fluids. While the mechanisms involved in fault sealing are well known, the microscale processes involved and their relative contribution to sealing remain debatable. In particular, the extent to which diagenetic processes overprint cataclastic fault sealing has not been resolved, mainly due to the long time scales required to measure these effects. Here, we report results from a novel suite of room temperature experiments that combined continuous analysis of dissolved silica using on-line high performance liquid chromatography, with low strain rate creep loading on sandstone cores. This technique allowed changes in silica concentration during different phases of deformation to be resolved, and revealed a 7-fold increase in overall silica concentration immediately after dynamic faulting by localised cataclasis. Calculations based on these results show that the mass of dissolved silica from the resultant fault gouge increased by up to two orders of magnitude relative to that from the intact rock over the same time scale. This increase represents the first stage of the inherent diagenetic sealing capacity of the fault, presumably through localised diffusive mass transfer. Post-test microstructural studies suggest that the magnitude of diagenetic self-sealing depends on lithological and mechanical attributes of the host rock, which control fault gouge microstructure. Our experiments suggest that diagenetic processes may account for permeability reduction of up to two orders of magnitude, comparable to reductions due to cataclasis alone. Together, these two processes account for the 5-6 orders of magnitude reduction of permeability observed in natural faults and deformation bands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The results confirm the presence of significant power at frequencies corresponding to the earth orbital parameters (eccentricity, obliquity, precession). The construction of the evolutionary spectrum allowed us to establish the non-stationarity of the signal at those frequencies. The subsequent use of wavelet techniques made it possible to demarcate the time intervals over which orbital frequencies are present in the record. For those intervals, the paleointensity record shows some coherency with the isothermal remanent magnetization, normalizer of the natural remanent magnetization, and the ratio anhysteretic remanent magnetization/k. These results suggest that the orbital frequencies embedded in the paleointensity record are the expression of lithologic variations, and probably not a characteristic of the geodynamo itself. Extracting (filtering) these wavelet components from the Site 983 paleointensity record indicates, however, that this secondary overprint is of sufficiently low level that it has a minor effect on the overall character of the record. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A 1.33 ha experimental area at Monaughty forest, northeast Scotland was treated with 200 m3 ha-1 of anaerobically digested sewage sludge. Approximately 400 kg ha-1 of nitrogen (N) and 200 kg ha-1 of phosphorus (P) were applied in the sludge treatment. The hydrological balance and fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus in throughfall and soil drainage water (O1, O2 and Bs soil horizons) over the short (3 month) and longer-term (17 month) period after application are compared with untreated areas. Immediate increases in soluble ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4) were apparent within the organic soil horizons and PO4 in the Bs horizons of sludge-treated areas. This observation was attributed to the direct leaching of nutrients contained within the original liquid phase which constituted 95% (by volume) of the sludge. The late autumn application of sludge which contained only small amounts of nitrate (NO3) (<0.05 kg N ha-1) initially resulted in limited additional mineralisation and consequently little N leached as NO3. Over the longer 17 month period the total fluxes of both N and P from sludge-treated areas remained greater than those of the untreated areas with significant losses as NO3 being detected from the organic and Bs horizons. However, total fluxes of N and P measured in the soil drainage water from the lowest soil horizon, over the whole study period represented 2.5 and <1%, respectively, of the total N and P applied as sludge. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The eucalypt species studied were:-Narrow-leaved Peppermint (Eucalyptus radiata), Mountain Swamp Gum (Eucalyptus camphora), Mountain Gum (Eucalyptus dalrympleana), Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha), Ribbon Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and, Broad-leaved Peppermint (Eucalyptus dives). E. radiata and E. macrorhyncha supported almost twice the proportion of branch-end hollows than cavities assigned to other categories. Cavities in the main trunk were the predominant hollow class in E. viminalis and E. dalrympleana. Large diameter trees were characterised by more branch-end hollows, whereas main trunk cavities were typically the most prevalent cavity type in smaller diameter stems. We identified a simple, general rule that highlights the relationships between cavities and readily measured tree attributes. Our data show that, in general, both the number of cavities and cavity size were directly proportional to tree diameter, but inversely proportional to the square root of tree height. This proportionality changed between different tree species. E. dives and E. viminalis supported, on average, larger cavities than other species, whereas the cavities in E. macrorhyncha were smaller than the other taxa sampled. This simple general relationship may make it possible to make rapid crude estimates of cavity abundance across large areas of forest by measuring simple tree attributes such as tree diameter and tree height.

We have analyzed the records of the permanent stations installed on the Australian continent, complemented by the data of the SKIPPY experiment. The results reveal substantial variations in the Poisson ratio in the different tectonic units. For the Proterozoic crust, an increase of the Poisson ratio with increasing crustal thickness is systematically observed while for the Phanerozoic crust, the Poisson ratio tends to decrease for increasing crustal thickness. These observations are in remarkable agreement with the results of the deep seismic soundings that were performed in the former Soviet Union. The variations observed in the Proterozoic provinces can perhaps be explained by underplating of mafic materials at the base of the crust. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The CAD models of relevant complex parts are usually defined using trimmed NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline). With such situations in mind, the paper proposes a new triangulation procedure which achieves high efficiency and robustness by utilising the CAD model as an available 2D manifold which approximates the shape of the actual part. The steps in this procedure are alignment between the data and the model, registration of the measured points to the model entities, triangulation in the R2 domain provided by the parametric surface entities, 3D mesh improvement, stitching of mesh patches and smoothing of the final mesh. The method does not assume any prior knowledge about the point ordering and performs well in the presence of the measurement noise, while also bypassing the problems of occlusion and overlap that are commonly associated with range imaging. The performance of the proposed method was analysed in relation to some other methods using models of real engineering parts. The results are highly encouraging, leading to a conclusion that the methods is well suited to practical engineering applications.",

The Roetian and Muschelkalk deposits of southern Poland (Upper Silesia, the Holy Cross Mountains) were studied paleomagnetically. The obtained paleopole 'A' (52\u00b0N, 143\u00b0E) fits well to the Middle Triassic (ca. 240 Ma) segment of the Stable European APWP. A set of various quality characteristic directions isolated in 106 samples was used for construction of the composite polarity scale. This Peritethyan scale has been tied with conodont zonation and referred to the scale erected earlier in the Tethyan realm. Comparison of both scales indicates that the whole Roetian succession in the southern Polish basin should be correlated with the latest Olenekian. The normal marine sedimentation ceased in the Polish basin as early as in the late Fassanian time. The obtained magnetostratigraphic scale combined with the sequence stratigraphic framework enables a reliable chronological correlation of the late Olenekian-Ladinian succession over the entire Peri-Tethys Basin.

        "Absrtact": "A central dilemma in understanding terranes that have translated long distances is that modern plate tectonics and paleomagnetic studies indicate translations of thousands of kilometers, while the faults along which the terranes moved these great distances are not found. Relations long known from geology and from recent studies of modern transform-plate boundaries suggest that preserving strike-slip faults that record 1000-km-scale translations is unlikely, and therefore, in many cases. Paleomagnetism may be our only reliable indicator of how far terranes translated. Four reasons are explored here for why large-offset strike-slip faults are likely to be missing in translated terranes. (1) Strike-slip faults in continents commonly are partially or wholly destroyed, or reactivated. Only ) e1400-500 km of over 1000 km of offset on Cretaceous-early Tertiary strike-slip faults in northern British Columbia are accounted for in southern British Columbia. The missing strike-slip faults probably continued south into the hinterland of the Rocky Mountain thrust belt as oblique-thrust faults, much like the modern Alpine-Marlborough fault system of New Zealand. The major strike-slip faults in southeastern British Columbia were obliterated by Eocene extensional faulting, uplift and erosion. (2) Offsets of 1000 km scale are likely to occur on many anastomosing faults with offsets of 100 km scale. Many of which are 'left behind' and not found in the translated terrane. The greater San Andreas plate boundary has accumulated \u223c1200 km of transform motion that is distributed on numerous faults from the offshore borderland to eastern California. There is a narrow 'terrane' in the offshore borderland of California that has moved \u223c1200 km relative to North America, but no single fault has nearly that much offset. (3) Major faults in narrow oceans formed by oblique-divergent plate boundaries have a low potential for preservation. For example, the deep, dense oceanic crust of the Gulf of California, where the major transform faults of the oblique rift lie, has a low potential for preservation. In contrast. Baja California is currently a continental terrane that has translated \u223c300 km relative to North America along the plate boundary in the Gulf of California. Because of the relative buoyancy of continental crust, Baja California is likely to be preserved in any future accretion event. (4) Faults in the margins of oblique-divergent plate boundaries are dominantly normal faults and not strike-slip faults. There is little strike-slip faulting in central Baja California. Even though the plate boundary has a rift angle \u03b1 of only 20\u00b0. Recent field data and modeling show that at \u03b1=0-20\u00b0 strikeslip faults will dominate the secondary faults. Surprisingly, at \u03b1 =\u223c20 to \u223c35\u00b0, there are both strike-slip and normal faults, and at \u03b1> \u223c35-45\u00b0, there are few or no strike-slip faults, even though the relative motion of these types of oblique rifts is dominated by transcurrent motion over extensional motion. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Sequential acoustic surveys and mark-recapture experiments were used to examine seasonal movements and distribution of coastal cod in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland (NAFO stock sub-division 3Ps). Cod were located in Placentia Bay in all seasons of 1997 and early 1998. Acoustically-measured densities and abundances were highest during spring-time spawning (>1 fish m-2). The degree of aggregation was highest in spring and fall (99% of fish in 8-12% of surveyed area), and low in summer (17-19%). Cod moved shallower after the spawning period, and occupied an increasingly narrow range of depths from spring to fall. In contrast, the range of temperatures occupied broadened over this period, as did available temperatures. Stomach contents indicated that cod were feeding on pelagic zooplankters (hyperiid amphipods) in late summer and fall. We conclude that local movements of cod are more related to depth and feeding behaviour than to temperature. Cod tagged primarily on spawning grounds in Placentia Bay were recaptured mostly within the bay (87%), where fishing effort was high. Recaptures of marked cod per unit weight of fishery catch indicated that 10-30%may move in spring and summer into the adjacent stock area (3L). The majority of tagged cod recaptured during the following spring was caught within Placentia Bay, suggesting a return migration. Almost all cod recaptured at long distances (>100 km, and up to 600 km) from tagging sites were large (>50 cm). Smaller fish were recaptured mostly within the bay, and closer to tagging sites. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of an ontogenetic threshold to long-distance migratory behaviour in cod. Evidence of repeat spawning, year-round residence, and return migrations from the bay, all suggest the existence of a Placentia Bay coastal cod stock. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Enantioselective stopped-flow multidimensional gas chromatography (stopped-flow MDGC) is a fast and simple technique to determine enantiomerization (inversion) barriers in the gas phase in a range of \u0394G(number sign)(gas)(T) = 70-200 kJ mol-1. After complete gas-chromatographic separation of the enantiomers in the first column, gas phase enantiomerization of the heart-cut fraction of one single enantiomer is performed in the second (reactor) column at increased temperature and afterwards this fraction is separated into the enantiomers in the third column. From the observed de novo enantiomeric peak areas a(j), the enantiomerization time t and the enantiomerization temperature T, the enantiomerization (inversion) barrier \u0394G(number sign)(gas)(T) is determined and from temperature-dependent experiments, the activation enthalpy \u0394H(number sign)(gas) and the activation entropy \u0394S(number sign)(gas) are obtained. Enantiomerization studies on chiral 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylaziridine by stopped-flow MDGC yielded activation parameters of nitrogen inversion in the gas phase, i.e., \u0394G(number sign)(gas)(353 K) = 110.5 \u00b1 0.5 kJ mol-1, \u0394H(number sign)(gas) = 71.0 \u00b1 3.8 kJ mol-1 and \u0394S(number sign)(gas) = -109 \u00b1 11 J mol-1 K-1. By the complementary method of dynamic gas chromatography (GC), the apparent enantiomerization (inversion) barrier of 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylaziridine in the gas-liquid biphase system was found \u0394G(number sign)(app)(353 K) = 108 kJ mol-1. The values obtained by stopped-flow MDGC in the gas phase were used to calculate the activation parameters of nitrogen inversion of 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylaziridine in the liquid phase in the presence of the chiral selector Chirasil-nickel(II), i.e., \u0394G(number sign)(liq)(353 K) = 106.0 \u00b1 0.4 kJ mol-1, \u0394H(number sign)(liq) = 68.3 \u00b1 1.4 kJ mol-1 and \u0394S(number sign)(liq) = -106 \u00b1 3.0 J mol-1 K-1.

        "Absrtact": "A new mechanistic model of N uptake and redistribution in wheat crops incorporating the effects of N shortages through variation in leaf area is described. The model is based on the assumption that the concentration of N in green tissue can be approximated as constant per unit leaf area and that excess N is stored in non-green tissue. Two hypotheses about how grain demand for N is set were also tested. These were that N-demand by the grain is set mostly in response to total N content in the crop (source determined), or that the N-demand is set according to the grain number per unit area (sink determined). The model was tested using data from widely separated, independent experiments. The model produced substantial improvement in the simulation of green area index (GAI) compared with an alternative older model, particularly in response to changes in N-supply, while retaining the ability to simulate biomass accumulation and grain growth accurately. Of the two hypotheses on the determination of grain N-demand, the source determined model gave substantially better estimates of final grain N concentration that were highly correlated with observations over a wide range of values, whereas the sink determined simulations were uncorrelated with observations. The study demonstrated that most of the variations caused by different N supply regimes can be simulated using a very simple mechanism, and that the inclusion of this more mechanistic approach conveys little extra complexity in a wheat simulation model.

Model parameters were allowed to vary as a result of acclimation, following experimental data reported in the literature. Biomass data from Santo Andre lagoon (SW Portugal) were used to calibrate the model. Validation was carried out with independent data sets from Santo Andre lagoon and from Tancada lagoon (NE Spain). Model simulations Show a reasonable agreement with observed data with a similar biomass temporal dynamics and peaks. Self-shading appears to be an important self-regulating mechanism of biomass growth and production. The results obtained predict an annual net primary production of 361 g DW m-2well within the estimates based on harvesting techniques (295-589 g DW m-2). Model results suggest that controlled harvesting of macrophyte biomass may be carried out without affecting macrophyte real net production, through the reduction of light limitation under the plant canopy.

Second goal of the study was to investigate advantages and disadvantages of principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) for livestock management research. Multicollinearity was present in the data set and the number of variables was high compared to the number of observations. Out of 70 variables related to breeding management and technical results at dairy farms, 19 were selected for PLS and PCR, based on a correlation of \u2265 0.25 or \u2264 -0.25 with 305-day milk production. Five principal components (PCs) were selected for PC-regression with 305-day milk production being the goal variable. Related variables were combined into one so-called synthetic factor. All synthetic variables were used in a path-analysis. The same path-analysis was worked out with PLS. PLS forms synthetic factors capturing most of the information for the independent X-variables that is useful for predicting the dependent Y-variable(s) while reducing the dimensionality. Both methodologies showed that milk production per cow is related to critical success factors of the producer, farm size, breeding value for production and conformation. Milk production per cow was the result of the attitude of the farmer as well as the genetic capacity of the cow. It was found that at high producing farms the producer put relatively much emphasis on the quality of the udder and less on the kg of milk. Advantages of PLS are the optimization towards the Y-variable, resulting in a higher R2, and the possibility to include more than one Y-variable. Advantages of PCR are that hypothesis testing can be performed, and that complete optimisation is used in determining the PCs. It is concluded that PLS is a good alternative for PCR when relations are complex and the number of observations is small. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Many textbooks and guidelines recommend serial amniocentesis to monitor these pregnancies. However, the reliability of amniotic fluid bilirubin measurements has been questioned. Two strategies have been proposed by investigators. Some advocate liberal or primary use of fetal blood sampling, while others promote the use of non-invasive ultrasonography and Doppler. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the usefulness of amniocentesis, ultrasonography and Doppler to predict the degree of fetal hemolytic anemia. The evidence suggests that amniotic fluid bilirubin measurements are of limited value in the second trimester. Furthermore, critical appraisal of the very few prospective studies is hampered by limitations in design or insufficient data given by the authors. Many ultrasound and Doppler parameters have been proposed as useful indicators of fetal anemia. The most promising of these methods are Doppler assessment of umbilical venous and middle cerebral artery flow velocities. We speculate that the accuracy of these non-invasive tests may be good enough to incorporate them in management protocols, possibly replacing amniocentesis. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to prove this hypothesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "A set of seismic reflection lines, collected in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea offshore the Campanian-Latial continental margin has been selected and interpreted. The aim is to characterize: (1) the structural features of the 41st Parallel Line (41PL), an E-W elongated magnetic anomaly zone separating the Northern Tyrrhenian domain from the Southern Tyrrhenian domain; and (2) to study the relationships between the 41PL and the Ortona-Roccamonfina Line (ORL), a tectonic structure transversal to the Apennines along which the Northern Apennine Arc merges the Southern Arc. The interpretation of the seismic lines is discussed in light of the available geological (stratigraphic and structural) and geophysical (gravimetric and magnetic) information. Results show that the Campanian-Latial continental margin is characterized by a series of structural lows and highs that match with the main structures on the mainland (Mt. Massico horst, the Volturno and Garigliano depressions). The study area is characterized by ESEWNW to E-W and NE-SW striking faults. The activity of these faults developed during Pliocene-Early Pleistocene times. ESE-WNW to E-W faults display structures consistent with strike-slip movements. These faults, which are located on the maximum gradient of the E-W elongated magnetic alignment of 41PL, are responsible for the SSE translation of the offshore sector of the Mt. Massico horst. The horizontal dislocation of Mt. Massico suggests left-lateral movements for the ESE-WNW to E-W faults. The NE-SW faults that affect the Mt. Massico horst, which represents the southern tip of ORL, show seismic features consistent with normal movements, as also revealed by inland data. Since: (1) background seismicity is virtually absent along the study area; and (2) the uppermost seismic reflectors seem unaffected by faults, it is very likely that both the ORL and 41PL fault zones are now inactive, at least in the Campanian-Latial area. Seismic data indicate that ORL is older than 41PL and support the interpretation that the 41PL represents a deep-seated transfer fault system formed in response to the different rates of opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The strike-slip movements along the 41PL faults and the normal movements along the ORL faults are consistent with a NW-SE extension, which is responsible for the longitudinal extension in the Southern Apennines belt.

We have assessed resting regional cerebral blood flow with 99mTc-ECD SPECT in 26 unmedicated OCD patients and 22 healthy control subjects using the voxel-based Statistical Parametric Mapping method for data analysis. We found a significantly reduced ECD uptake in OCD patients relative to the control subjects in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (P<0.001 two-tailed, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). There were significant positive correlations in the OCD group between the ECD uptake in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and ratings for obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS), and between the ECD uptake in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex and the ratings for both OCS and depressive symptoms. There were also unpredicted significant ECD uptake increases in the cerebellum in OCD patients, as well as a negative correlation between posterior cingulate ECD uptake and OCS severity (P<0.05, corrected for multiple testing). These results implicate specific subregions of the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in the pathophysiology of OCD, as well as suggesting the involvement of other areas not usually included in ROI-based imaging studies. With the incorporation of voxel-based methods and the use of large patient samples, rCBF-SPECT studies may continue to provide valuable information about the functional anatomy of OCD.

        "Absrtact": "Models relating crop production to resource capture and resource use efficiency (RESCAP) may be combined with the phenotype model applied in breeding that identifies sources of variation for traits. Estimating the parameters of the RESCAP models with low-cost non-destructive methods can improve the attribution of sources of variation in the phenotype model and, therefore, improve breeding efficiency. Since the resource captured is largely environmental(E), determining the contributions to yield from this source can leave a better estimate of the genetic(G) and G x E contributions to the phenotype. Some of the potential or existing applications include: (a) breeding for productivity through improved resource capture and/or use efficiency, and screening materials for difficult traits such as root traits in drought resistance/tolerance breeding programs; (b) evaluation of crop improvement strategies. Decisions about selection priorities and sequences depend on the relative extent of genetic and environmental contributions to variation. The RESCAP approach allows the relative components of the phenotype model to be estimated cheaply and aids in their interpretation; (c) improving statistical analysis of breeding trials by exploiting the non-destructive growth analysis of plot yields to isolate the genetic contributions to yield within trials with large error terms due to non-systematic environmental effects and (d) improved selection for yield in early generation segregating populations. RESCAP based on non-destructive single plant and small plot (row) growth analysis and the different contributions of RESCAP model parameters to the phenotype model terms effectively increase the heritability of yield with the attendant possible changes in plant breeding efficiency and practice.

Analysis and handling of such data is becoming one of the major bottlenecks in the utilization of the technology. The raw microarray data are images, which have to be transformed into gene expression matrices - tables where rows represent genes, columns represent various samples such as tissues or experimental conditions, and numbers in each cell characterize the expression level of the particular gene in the particular sample. These matrices have to be analyzed further, if any knowledge about the underlying biological processes is to be extracted. In this paper we concentrate on discussing bioinformatics methods used for such analysis. We briefly discuss supervised and unsupervised data analysis and its applications, such as predicting gene function classes and cancer classification. Then we discuss how the gene expression matrix can be used to predict putative regulatory signals in the genome sequences.

        "Absrtact": "Background and purpose: Prior to randomization of patients into the UK Medical Research Council multicentre randomized trial (RT-01) of conformal radiotherapy (CFRT) in prostate cancer, clinicians at participating centres were required to complete a quality assurance (QA) clinical planning exercise to enable an investigation of inter-observer variability in gross target volume (GTV) and normal structure outlining. Materials and methods: Thirteen participating centres and two investigators completed the clinical planning exercise of three practice planning cases. Clinicians were asked to draw outlines of the GTV, rectum and bladder on hard-copy computerized tomography (CT) films of the pelvis, which were transferred onto the Cadplan computer planning system by a single investigator. Centre, inferior and superior CT levels of GTV, rectum and bladder were noted, and volume calculations performed. Planning target volumes (PTV) were generated using automatic volume expansion of GTVs by a 1 cm margin. Anterior, right and left lateral beam eye views (BEV) of the PTVs were generated. Using a common central point, the BEV PTVs were superimposed for each beam direction of each case. Radial PTV variation was investigated by measurement of a novel parameter, termed the radial line measurement variation (RLMV). Results: GTV central slice and length were defined with reasonable consistency. The RLMV analysis showed that the main part of the prostate gland, bladder and inferior rectum were outlined with good consistency among clinicians. However, the outlining of the prostatic apex, superior aspect of the prostate projecting into the bladder, seminal vesicles, the base of seminal vesicles and superior rectum were more variable. Conclusion: This exercise has demonstrated adequate consistency of GTV definition. The RLMV method of analysis indicates particular regions of clinician uncertainty. Appropriate feedback has been given to all participating clinicians, and the final RT-01 trial protocol has been modified to accommodate these findings. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Nearly optimal solutions of linear programming models provide useful information when some of the relevant objectives and constraints are not explicitized in the models. This paper presents a three steps framework to study nearly optimal solutions of linear programming models developed for land use exploration. The first step is to define low dimensional vectors called 'aspects' to summarize the solutions. The second step is to generate a group of optimal and of nearly optimal solutions. Three methods are proposed for generating nearly optimal solutions. Method i proceeds by minimization of sums of decision variables that are non-zero in the optimal solution and in previously generated nearly optimal solutions. Method ii proceeds by maximization of sums of randomly selected decision variables. Method iii is targeted at searching nearly optimal solutions with very different values for the aspects. Finally, the third step of the framework is to present graphically the values of the aspects of the generated solutions. The framework is illustrated with a case study in which a linear programming model developed for land use exploration at the European level is presented. First, an optimal solution is calculated with the model by minimizing nitrogen loss with constraints on area, water use, product balances, and manure balances. Then, 52 nearly optimal solutions are generated by using methods i, ii, and iii with a deviation tolerance of 5% from the optimal value of nitrogen loss. Each solution is summarized by three different aspects that represent the allocations of the agricultural. area among two regions, among five types of crop rotation, and among five production orientations respectively. Graphical presentation of these aspects and principal component analysis show that nearly optimal solutions can be very different from the optimal solution in terms of land use allocations. For example, the agricultural area allocated to the north of the European Community varies from 10.9 to 50.2 x 106 ha among the 52 generated nearly optimal solutions, whereas this area is equal to 26.5 x l06 ha in the optimal solution. The comparison of methods i, ii, and iii shows that the solutions generated with method iii are quite more contrasted than the solutions generated with methods i and ii. The case study presented in this paper illustrates how our methodological framework can be used to allow a stakeholder to select a satisfactory solution according to issues that cannot be quantified in a model.

The purpose of this study was to compare clinicians' prior probability estimates of operative mortality (OM) and prolonged intensive care unit stay (ICU) length of stay greater than 48 hours after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with estimates derived from statistical models alone. Methods. Nine clinicians estimated the predicted probability of OM and ICU stay greater than 48 hours from an abstract of information for each of 100 patients selected from the 1996 to 1997 database of 1,904 patients who underwent isolated CABG. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the predicted probability of OM and ICU stay greater than 48 hours for each patient. The study sample was split into two parts; clinicians were randomly given access to a predictive rule to guide their judgements for one part of the study. Results. Clinicians' estimates were similar with or without access to the rule, and both parts of the study were therefore pooled. Clinicians significantly overestimated the probability of OM (model 6.3% \u00b1 1%, clinicians 7.6% \u00b1 3%, p = 0.0001) and ICU stay greater than 48 hours (model 25% \u00b1 2%, clinicians 28% \u00b1 1%, p = 0.0012). Clinicians' estimates of OM were not significantly higher than the model's for nonsurvivors (0.8% \u00b10.7%, p = 0.2), but were significantly higher for survivors (1.4% \u00b1 0.3%, p = 0.039). Conclusions. Clinicians trusted their own empiric estimates rather than a predictive rule and overestimated the probability of OM and ICU stay greater than 48 hours.

The interactions of plasma IgM and IgG with tissue extracts as sources of self-antigens were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting. Data were compared by means of multiparametric statistical analysis. The data summarized here demonstrate that natural self-reactive antibody repertoires of healthy individuals are restricted to a limited subset of immunodominant autoantigens that is selected early in development, and remains conserved between individuals through ageing. The selection of human natural self- reactive IgG antibody repertoires requires normal T-/B-cell interactions. The immunoblotting assay has the potential to distinguish between autoimmune diseases with organ-related oligoclonal expansion of self-reactive clones and those characterized by broad alterations of immunoregulation. However, organ- specific autoimmune diseases may be characterized by altered patterns of antibody repertoires unrelated to the target organ. The assay also revealed an unexpected defect in the regulatory function of self-reactive IgM on the expression of self-reactive IgG repertoires in several systemic and organ- specific autoimmune diseases. The results are discussed in the light of our current understanding of the processes of selection of self-reactive B-cells and the pathophysiology of autoimmunity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Marrow ablation is a model of bone turnover in which the excavated tibial intramedullary cavity is rapidly and reproducibly filled by osteoblasts with new woven bone (days 6-8), which is then rapidly resorbed by osteoclasts (days 10-15). We showed previously (Magnuson et al., 1997) that marrow ablation induces a dramatic hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in rats that unexpectedly peaked at the time of maximal osteogenesis and continued throughout the subsequent resorption phase. Based upon the amount of calcium mobilized and a peak of urinary hydroxyproline, we suggested that the hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria were due to increased systemic osteoclastic bone resorption induced by marrow ablation. We now apply a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rodent \u03b12(I) N-telopeptide (NTx), a marker of bone resorption, to the marrow ablation model to demonstrate that excretion of NTx parallels that of calcium release in the operated control group. Specifically, maximal NTx/creatinine excretion coincides with the onset of hypercalcemia on days 7-8. A peak of NTx was also observed in methylprednisolone- and deflazacort-treated ablated animals. Analyses for urinary free deoxypyridinoline crosslink failed to detect a significant ablation-induced change in excretion. Interleukin 6 activity was increased in all operated control and glucocorticoid-treated groups after marrow ablation, whereas serum parathyroid hormone remained at presurgical levels in operated controls throughout the 15-day study period. The NTx results confirm that bilateral tibial marrow ablation induces a burst of extratibial bone resorption and hypercalcemia 7-8 days later. We have estimated that the osteogenic phase of the ablation model deposits 40 mg of calcium as hydroxyapatite crystals within the intramedullary cavity on days 6-8; this represents 33%-50% of the total blood calcium content of a young rat. We hypothesize that the size and rapidity of this demand for ionized calcium is met through an extratibial bone resorption pathway of osteoclast formation and activation that anticipates and fulfills this need, and that is initiated at the time of marrow ablation.

The demographics of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have changed over time and may contribute to differing operative mortality and the combination of mortality and morbidity (M + M). In this study, the trends in results are analyzed and causes are suggested. Methods. Prospectively collected data concerning 4,839 CABG operations was divided into three time cohorts (1990 to 1992, 1993 to 1995, 1996 to 1998) and analyzed by univariate and multivariate techniques. Results. Mean age and female gender frequency increased in the later time cohorts (60.7 \u00b1 9.0 to 63.4 \u00b1 9.9 years and 16.5% to 21.4%, respectively). The following comorbidities were more prevalent in the later time cohorts: diabetes (26.7% versus 18.6%), renal failure (8.5% versus 2.2%), peripheral vascular disease (20.7% versus 11.0%), previous cerebrovascular accident (6.7% versus 5.0%), urgent procedures (41.5% versus 26.9%), unstable angina (47.8% versus 31.7%), urgent CABG following myocardial infarction (17.1% versus 7.3%), previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (8.0% versus 4.5%), ejection fraction less than 35% (20.5% versus 10.4%), (all p < 0.05). Procedurally, increased utilization of the left internal mammary artery, multiple arterial conduits, and warm blood cardioplegia occurred in the later cohorts (91.2%, 22.2%, and 80.4% versus 78.7%, 3.4%, and 38.0%, respectively). The mortality rate was 2.0% and the M + M rate was 15.6% in all 4,839 patients. The mortality and M + M for the three cohorts were 1.6%, 2.0%, and 2.3% and 18.4%, 17.2% and 12.5%, respectively. The risk-adjusted mortality and M + M decreased from 2.4% and 15.9%, respectively, in 1990 to 1992 to 1.8% and 8.4% in 1996 to 1998 (p < 0.001). The difference in adjusted event rates was minimized when the surgical factors were entered into the model. Conclusions. Over time, there has been a trend toward operating on older patients with more comorbidities. Though hospital mortality has been stable, risk-adjusted M + M has been in a constant decline. This decline was associated with an increased use of left internal mammary artery grafts, multiple arterial conduits, and warm blood cardioplegia during the later years of the study.

The hydrophobic polyaromatic hydrocarbon benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and the more polar 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene (PRODAN) were used to assess the effect of high quencher concentration on the quenching process in micelles. Using the surfactant systems sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100 (TX-100), three distinct modalities of quenching were observed. For the TX-100 system, both I- and H2O2 quenching of probe fluorescence reached saturation in efficiency. These data are modeled quite well by assuming a limited number of quenching sites per micelle in conjunction with standard Stern-Volmer quenching dynamics. For the SDS system, similar quenching saturation effects are observed, but the saturation model worked less well. It is suggested that a bimodal distribution of micelle sizes could be responsible. The B(a)P/SDS/I- system is singular in that the quenching does not saturate. The efficiency of quenching here varies approximately with the third power of I- concentration. A resonance energy transfer mechanism is proposed in which B(a)P is quenched by I3 -. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.",

In this study cytokine-induced expression of hsp60, hsp27 and \u03b1B-crystallin was studied in cultures of primary human adult astrocytes at the mRNA as well as at the protein level. We show differential hsp expression patterns in response to pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. Hsp60 expression was found to be enhanced in response to cytokines as diverse as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10. Upregulation of hsp27, however, was primarily induced by immunoregulatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 whereas \u03b1B-crystallin expression was found to be enhanced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 only. None of the cytokines studied was able to enhance expression of all three hsp simultaneously. These results show that in human astrocytes induced expression of hsp27 and \u03b1B-crystallin is dependent on the presence of a defined set of stimuli, while induced expression of hsp60 is a much less selective event. This highly differential pattern of hsp expression in response to inflammatory mediators known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases indicates that hsp responses are specific rather than non-specific bystander responses.

High-resolution seismic, lithologic, paleontologic, and radiocarbon data from the east Texas continental shelf were used to map a stage 3 shoreline. The shoreline was placed in a regional context with a study of the Texas shelf, based on seismic profiles, core, and platform boring descriptions, that identifies the stage 3 maximum flooding surface and the stage 2 sequence boundary. These surfaces were then traced up-dip on the east Texas shelf where a shore parallel escarpment was recognized. Landward of the escarpment the stage 3 maximum flooding surface is amalgamated with the stage 2 sequence boundary. Therefore, the location of the escarpment marks the up-dip limit of stage 3 deposits and a stage 3 shoreline. Lagoonal sediments with in situ brackish water fossils on-lap the escarpment. Seaward of the escarpment, remnants of barrier island facies have been preserved as a bank, Freeport Rocks Bathymetric High, located in -18 m of water. The shoreline (adjusted for subsidence) is located at -15 \u00b1 2 m, which is shallower than what oxygen isotope and coral records indicate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In polar environments, characterization of antioxidant defences in key sentinel species may be of particular value as early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are progressively increasing in these remote areas. The complexities associated with predicting the consequences at the 'organism level' of variations of specific antioxidant defences have been recently overcome by the ability to quantify an index of specific biological resistance to various kinds of ROS. The total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay has been used in three species of scallops for quantifying their ability to neutralize peroxyl (ROO\u00b7) and hydroxyl (\u00b7OH) radicals and peroxynitrite (HOONO). Adamussium colbecki and Chlamys islandicus represent key organisms for monitoring Antarctic and Arctic regions while Pecten jacobaeus was chosen for a comparison with a related temperate species. TOSC values for ROO\u00b7 were significantly higher in A. colbecki indicating this species as the most efficient scavenger of ROO\u00b7. Mediterranean scallops had the lowest TOSC for ROO\u00b7. A. colbecki also exhibited the highest scavenging capacity for \u00b7OH with values more than 2- fold greater than for C. islandicus and P. jacobaeus. TOSC for HOONO was lower for all scallops as compared to those for ROO\u00b7 or \u00b7OH. TOSC for microsomes was not significantly different among the species for any ROS studied, and the percentage contribution to the specific TOSC for the various oxidants of microsomes of all scallops accounted for 1-3% of the total TOSC of the post-mitochondrial fraction. The specific TOSC of scallop microsomes for \u00b7OH was approximately ten times lower than that for ROO\u00b7 or HOONO. The higher basal capability of the Antarctic scallop to neutralize different reactive oxygen species is discussed in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment and TOSC is validated as a quantifiable measure of susceptibility to oxidative stress in marine organisms.

The pattern of the palaeocurrent index indicates faster flow during the warm periods and slower in cold. This also holds in the Younger Dryas but there is an added effect of brief collapse of the circulation in Termination 1B due to meltwater input. The cold periods are generally characterised by elevated clay percentage (terrigenous material < 2 \u03bcm diameter) and overall sediment accumulation fluxes. In comparison, warm periods of higher flow have lower depositional flux and a tendency to silt (terrigenous material 2-63 \u03bcm) dominance consistent with the higher flow speed and suppression of clay deposition. This is in contrast with a recent 230Th(xs)\u00b0-based study of two cores (MD95-2040 and -2039) [J. Thomson et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 165 (1999) 255-270], which concluded that increased glacial sediment and Th focussing was caused by stronger currents. The crucial factor is that the controlling speed is that of the flow at the depositional site rather than that of the erosional or transporting flow to the site. High glacial maximum fluxes of carbonate (~6 g cm-2 ka-1) are largely composed of fine (<63 \u03bcm) non-coccolith material, suggesting a significant detrital component. It is proposed that the sediment and Th arrive on the lower slope via different routes, sediment down-slope in bottom nepheloid layers and turbidity currents, Th scavenged from the water column by organic matter, and are rapidly mixed on the bed. Removal of this material from a large area and its deposition in a small one adjacent to Oporto Seamount, together with a small amount of direct down-slope supply, accounts for the properties of the deposits. Allowance for erroneous fluxes due to possible coring expansion 'stretching' of the upper part of MD95-2040 does not invalidate these conclusions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using wavelength independent emissivity very good agreement was found with previous melting study, theoretical calculations and shockwave experiments. Analysis of the data using Lindemann and Simon melting equations suggests that melting occurs close to, but not exactly at the same pressure as measured at the cold state. Grueneisen parameter \u03b3 scales with volume as \u03b3/\u03b30 = V/V0, where \u03b30 = 2.2\u00b10.1, a value close to 2.14 from adiabatic decompression experiments. The melting curve, when transformed to normalized coordinates, verifies the prediction of work of Schlosser et al. for the linear relationship between normalized melting temperature and normalized pressure. Fit of the combined data from melting, thermal expansion, room compression, and shockwave studies to the Mie-Grueneisen thermal equation of state gives \u03b30 = 2.42\u00b10.02; Anderson's thermal pressure model yields -0.032\u00b10.001 and -0.001\u00b10.001 GPa/K for the temperature derivative of isothermal bulk modulus at constant pressure and constant volume, respectively.",

In contrast, their use in correlations with pharmacokinetic properties is still poorly explored and exploited. 3D molecular fields can be obtained from ab initio, semiempirical or molecular mechanics levels of calculation. The newly developed procedure called VolSurf is able to compress the relevant information present in 3D maps into a few descriptors characterized by the simplicity of their use and interpretation. These descriptors can be quantitatively compared and used to build multivariate models correlating 3D molecular structures with biological responses. The VolSurf procedure is applied here to generate descriptors and models of structure-permeation relationships. The VolSurf procedure, which was originally designed to handle a medium amount of data, can easily be applied to problems of large size such as bioisostere databases, CombyChem databases and related approaches.

        "Absrtact": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can produce chronic cognitive learning/memory deficits that are thought to be mediated, in part, by impaired hippocampal function. Experimentally induced TBI is associated with deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, or LTP) at acute post-injury intervals but plasticity has not been examined at long- term survival periods. The present study was conducted to assess the temporal profile of LTP after injury and to evaluate the effects of injury severity on plasticity. Separate groups of rats were subjected to mild (1.1-1.4 atm), moderate (1.8-2.1 atm), or severe (2.2-2.7 atm) fluid percussion (FP) injury (or sham surgery) and processed for hippocampal electrophysiology in the first or eighth week after injury. LTP was defined as a lasting increase in field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) slope in area CA1 following tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. The fEPSP slope was measured for 60 min after tetanus. Assessment of LTP at the acute interval (6 days) revealed modest peak slope potentiation values (129-139%), which declined in each group (including sham) over the hour-long recording session and did not differ between groups. Eight weeks following injury, slices from all groups exhibited robust maximal potentiation (134-147%). Levels of potentiation among groups were similar at the 5-min test interval but differed significantly at the 30- and 60-min test intervals. Whereas sham slices showed stable potentiation for the entire 60-min assessment period, slices in all of the injury groups exhibited a significant decline in potentiation over this period. These experiments reveal a previously unknown effect of TBI whereby experimentally induced injury results in a chronic inability of the CA1 hippocampus to maintain synaptic plasticity. They also provide evidence that sham surgical procedures can significantly influence hippocampal physiology at the acute post-TBI intervals. The results have implications for the mechanisms underlying the impaired synaptic plasticity following TBI. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

Crystal structures of wild-type and a double mutant Plasmodium falciparum cyclophilin (PfCyP19 and mPfCyP19) complexed with CsA have been determined using diffraction terms to a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5 (1 \u00c5 = 0.1 nm). The wild-type has a single PfCyP19/CsA complex per asymmetric unit in space group P1 and refined to an R-work of 0.15 and R-free of 0.19. An altered cyclophilin, with two accidental mutations, Phe120 to Leu in the CsA binding pocket and Leu171 to Trp at the C terminus, presents two complexes per asymmetric unit in the orthorhombic space group P21212. This refined to an R-work of 0.18 and R-free 0.21. The mutations were identified from the crystallographic analysis and the C-terminal alteration helps to explain the different crystal forms obtained. PfCyP19 shares approximately 61% sequence identity with human cyclophilin A (hCyPA) and the structures are similar, consisting of an eight-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrel core capped by two \u03b1-helices. The fold creates a hydrophobic active-site, the floor of which is formed by side-chains of residues from four antiparallel \u03b2-strands and the walls from loops and turns. We identified C - H \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 O hydrogen bonds between the drug and protein that may be an important feature of cyclophilins and suggest a general mode of interaction between hydrophobic molecules. Comparisons with cyclophilin-dipeptide complexes suggests that a specific C - H \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 O hydrogen bonding interaction may contribute to ligand binding. Residues Ser106, His99 and Asp130, located close to the active site and conserved in most cyclophilins, are arranged in a manner reminiscent of a serine protease catalytic triad. A Ser106Ala mutant was engineered to test the hypothesis that this triad contributes to CyP function. Mutant and wild-type enzymes were found to have similar catalytic properties.

        "Absrtact": "A high-resolution cyclostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic study was carried out on cyclically bedded successions of middle Miocene lacustrine to distal alluvial fan-floodplain deposits from the Calatayud basin, in northeast Spain. Eight (partially overlapping) subsections near the village of Orera are correlated in detail using distinct sedimentary cycle patterns or by following marker beds in the field. Together they form the Orera Composite Section (OCS). Sedimentary cycles are recognised on at least two different scales. The basic small-scale cycles in the OCS consist of an alternation of grey and, occasionally, red clays with white, dolomite-rich, carbonate beds. They are arranged in larger-scaled, so-called large-scale cycles based on repetitive changes in the overall carbonate-clay lithology. Two other, but less distinct, types of intermediate scale cyclicity are also recognised. In terms of depositional environment, the cycle hierarchy is interpreted to represent periodic lake expansion over the palaeo-alluvial fan-floodplain area. The palaeomagnetic results yield a reliable magnetostratigraphic record, which confirms the cyclostratigraphic correlations between the subsections in detail. Rock magnetic experiments reveal that haematite is the main magnetic carrier of the primary component. The magnetostratigraphy of the OCS is correlated straightforwardly with the geomagnetic polarity time scale. This resulted in an age of 10.7-12.8 Ma for the entire succession, which is supported by fossil micromammal findings. In addition, it also reveals the presence of two, possibly three, short new polarity intervals. Based on the number of cycles in the OCS the average periodicity of the basic small-scale cycles is approximately 23 000 yr, while the large-scale cycle indicates a periodicity of 400 000 yr. This suggests that these sedimentary cycles are controlled by astronomically induced climate changes causing lake-level fluctuations and thus resulting in the deposition of carbonate-clay cycles. The continental sequences of the OCS provide a unique opportunity to extend the astronomical polarity time scale into the middle Miocene. The overlap of such continental sequences in the Mediterranean area with time-equivalent astronomically induced marine sequences is fundamental for establishing marine-continental, bed-to-bed, correlations and for understanding regional climate change.

A variety of inputs create eight different groups, each with a potentially different relationship between the angular and linear components.

The synthetic seismograms in this paper are computed using the first-order Born approximation.

Both cultures displayed a high rate of degradation for a wide range of hydrocarbon compounds. The bacterial species composition of these cultures was investigated by PCR of the 16S rDNA gene using multiple primer combinations. Near full-length 16S rDNA clone libraries were generated and screened by restriction analysis prior to sequence analysis. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was carried out using two other PCR primer sets targeting either the V3 or V6-V8 regions, and sequences derived from prominent DGGE bands were compared to sequences obtained via cloning. All data sets suggested that the seawater culture was dominated by \u03b1-subgroup proteobacteria, whereas the freshwater culture was dominated by members of the \u03b2- and \u03b3-proteobacteria. However, the V6-V8 primer pair was deficient in the recovery of Sphingomonas- like 16S rDNA due to a 3' terminal mismatch with the reverse primer. Most 16S rDNA sequences recovered from the marine enrichment were not closely related to genera containing known oil-degrading organisms, although some were detected. All methods suggested that the freshwater enrichment was dominated by genera containing known hydrocarbon-degrading species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Since radionuclide transfer varies in space and time depending on deposition processes, soil type, land use, and resulting contamination in food products, the radionuclide transfer through food chains derived from a variety of ecosystems is analysed by the use of models embedded in a Geographical Information System. The Chernigov region in northern Ukraine was affected by the Chernobyl fallout resulting in deposition levels ranging from 15 to 300 kBq m-2. GIS-based steady state and dynamic transfer models within an environmental decision support system (EDSS) were run for this region to model radiocaesium transfer from soil to various agricultural products on a collective farm level and on a district level within this region using spatial data sets of soil attributes, soil contamination and land use. Observed agricultural product contamination was available for comparison with model predictions. This paper presents examples of radiocaesium transfer from soil to fodder grass and potatoes to make an initial assessment of the radioecological situation in the Chernigov region to identify critical gaps in the model structure and data required for model input and validation. It highlights the feasibility of applying spatial and temporal data sets to make predictions of the present radioecological situation, as an alternative to approaches commonly used which categorise such data sets, thereby losing valuable information.

We investigated three basaltic lava flow tops from Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages determined for those basalt flows by incremental laser heating of leached groundmass samples are 152 \u00b1 26 ka, 281 \u00b1 19 ka and 1.35 \u00b1 0.01 Ma (\u00b1 2\u03c3). Three or four different olivine phenocryst samples have been analyzed from each flow for their cosmogenic 3 He abundances. The resulting 3 He production rates in olivine at sea level at 29\u00b0latitude are 82 \u00b1 14 and 82 \u00b1 8 atoms g -1 a -1 , as obtained from the 152 ka and 281 ka old flows, respectively. Considering effects of erosion on the 1.35 Ma old flow we find that the production rate of 82 \u00b1 8 atoms g -1 a -1 is consistent with the cosmogenic 3 He production during the last 1.35 Ma. There appears to be a 14% discrepancy between previously published production rates derived at higher latitudes and altitudes if the scaling factors of Lal are used to compare results. This discrepancy is greatly reduced, however, if the revised scaling factors of Dunai (this issue) are applied. Using the new scaling factors we derive a production rate for cosmogenic 3 He in olivine at sea level and high latitudes (> 60\u00b0) of 118 \u00b1 11 atoms g -1 a -1 (\u00b1 2\u03c3). The corresponding revised value of Cerling and Craig, and Ackert et al.) is 123 \u00b1 6 atoms g -1 a -1 (\u00b1 2\u03c3). The mean value of these two calibrations is 121 \u00b1 6 atoms g -1 a -1 (\u00b1 2\u03c3). We suggest that the production rate of 121 \u00b1 6 atoms g -1 a -1 at sea level and high latitudes may be applied to the complete time range where paleomagnetic data indicate that there was no long-term averaged intensity variation in the Earth's magnetic field, i.e. over the last 10 Ma. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Social anxiety disorder is a risk factor for the development of depression and alcohol/substance use or dependence, especially in cases with an early onset (< 15 years). Individuals with social anxiety disorder have significant functional impairment, notably in the areas of initiation and maintenance of social/romantic relationships and educational and work achievement. The economic consequences of social anxiety disorder are considerable, with a high level of diminished work productivity, unemployment and an increased utilisation of medical services amongst sufferers. Effective treatment of social anxiety disorder would improve its course and its health and economic consequences. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.",

        "Absrtact": "Methods of user-computer interaction have remained largely unchanged since the introduction of graphical user interfaces and their popularization by the Apple Macintosh in the early 1980s. Most of today's applications rely on primitive modalities, such as typing and pointing for input generation, which works well for a host of common business applications, but falls short for more complex tasks. To improve the interaction between user and computer we propose a concept that allows people to visualize their ideas, problems, or instructions during the initial phase of an interaction with a computer by augmenting traditional interaction modalities with sketching, gesturing and talking. This approach leads to a more natural user-computer interaction and enhances a user's ability to find solutions to a problem. We suggest that computers become actively involved in the process of problem formulation and that they provide support and give advice where this is adequate. This leads to a process of incremental problem formulation where user and computer are able to better visualize the actual task and fewer misunderstandings occur. Geographic information systems (GIS) would benefit from improved user interaction techniques. GIS are inherently complex and an interaction is often tedious, mostly because such systems are based on sequential and nonspatial input methods that lack the capability of expressing spatial concepts appropriately. We advocate for a visualization in an early stage of the problem solving process in GIS and discuss its advantages and challenges. The paper gives application examples and discusses future research topics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The completion tests were found to account for all of the variance in Gc and knowledge that the cloze tests accounted for, and resulted in incremental predictive validity for both domains.

        "Absrtact": "population-based cross-sectional study was conducted to examine factors affecting the severity of motor vehicle traffic crashes (MVTCs) involving elderly drivers in Ontario. The study population included drivers aged 65 and over involved in injury-producing MVTCs between 1988 and 1993 on Ontario public roads. Information was obtained from the Canadian Traffic Accident Information Databank (TRAID) compiled from police reports. The severity of MVTC was classified as fatal, major, minor or minimal. Comparisions between fatal-, major-, minor- and minimal-injury crashes were conducted. Percentage distributions of crashes at each level of severity involving elderly drivers were examined according to specific factors and tested using the X2 test. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate the estimated relative risk as odds ratios (ORs) while controlling for confounding factors. A number of factors were significantly related to the increased risk of fatal-injury in crashes compared with a reference category for each variable. These included age (OR = 1.4 for 70-79 and OR = 2.3 for 80 +), sex (OR = 1.4 for males), failing to yield right-of-way/disobeying traffic signs (OR = 1.7), non-use of seat belts (OR = 4.0), ejection from vehicle (OR = 11.3), intersection without traffic controls (OR = 1.7), roads with higher speed limits (OR = 7.9 for 70-90 km/h; OR = 5.8 for 100 km/h), snowy weather (OR = 1.6), head-on collisions (OR = 55.1), two-vehicle turning collisions (OR = 3.1 for left-turn, OR = 8.7 for right-turn), overtaking (OR = 5.6), and changing lanes (OR = 2.1). Adverse medical/physical conditions increased the risk of fatality by a factor of 5 for drivers 75-79 years of age and a factor of 3.5 for those 80 years and over. However, in the age group 65-74, medical/physical condition did not appear to be related to risk of fatality. Similar but weaker associations between these factors and risk of major- and minor-injury in crashes were also observed. To reduce the severity of crashes involving elderly drivers, strategies could target specific factors such as head-on collisions, single-vehicle collisions, and traffic controls at intersections. Driver conditions such as medical/physical conditions and driver actions such as failing to yield right-of-way/disobeying traffic signs should be examined further. \u00a9 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study examines the deforestation and level of forest fragmentation in one of the two deforestation fronts in the Amazon region outside Brazil: the Napo region of western Amazonia. Data were generated using satellite imagery for the years 1986 and 1996. Results show that while the extent and rate of deforestation in the region are important, they are less than previously reported. Forest fragmentation, however, adds a significant level of impact by affecting a very large proportion of the remaining forest cover. Better understanding of the dynamics and patterns of deforestation at regional, national and global levels requires the study of a representative number of areas. A regional focus, like that used here, facilitates this because most deforestation occurs in a small number of high-intensity deforestation fronts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The heart-of-palm is a gourmet vegetable composed of the tender unexpanded leaves in the palm's crown. Both spiny and spineless germplasm is available to growers, but there are no clear data on the superiority of either. Comparisons made among populations, among progenies within populations or among alleles within progenies are of interest for different reasons. In Hawaii, the Yurimaguas population (93% spineless; Pampa Hermosa landrace) is superior in heart-of-palm weight at one site and the Benjamin Constant (BC) population (79% spineless; Putumayo landrace) at another. Within the BC population there is a tendency for spineless plants to be superior in heart weight at one site and spiny to be superior at another. Within BC progenies, spineless plants often have more off-shoots at both sites, but superiority of spineless or spiny in terms of relative growth rates, heart weight and total edible weight depends upon location and seldom exceeds 10%. Although these yield components have low heritabilities there is variation amenable to selection, so that selecting within spineless germplasm should provide gains similar to those for spiny germplasm. Which is better is not a biological question but must be answered based upon comparative costs (management of spiny plants costs marginally to much more) and availability of germplasm at a given location.",

Chloride level measured in spring water was far more seasonally stable than that measured in surface (river) water, and thus the spatial pattern of Cl contamination indicated by the former was judged to be more reliable. Chloride contamination of groundwater in the GTA was strongly related to urbanisation, and at the four most affected springs increases of between 21 and 34% were detected over the period November 1996 to November 1997. The response of macroinvertebrates living in these springs to increasing salinity was examined with the aim of creating a biological index of contamination: the Chloride Contamination Index (CCI). A power function yielded a significant correlation between this index and the mean Cl concentration measured at each spring. Taxa were able to be categorised as either 'tolerant' or 'non-tolerant' of high Cl although none was unique to either end of the scale. However, from both field observations and salinity tolerance trials in the laboratory, the amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus was found to be associated with source aquifers only mildly contaminated with Cl. Absence of this species from a spring, particularly if nymphs of the stonefly Nemoura trispinosa are present should indicate moderate to high contamination.",

BACKGROUND: The interpretation of Doppler filling patterns is limited by confounding effects of left ventricular (LV) relaxation and preload. Color M-mode v(p) has been proposed as a new index of LV relaxation. METHODS: We studied four dogs before and during inferior caval (IVC) occlusion at five different inotropic stages and 14 patients before and during partial cardiopulmonary bypass. Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volumes (LV-EDV), the time constant of isovolumic relaxation (tau), left atrial (LA) pre-A and LV end-diastolic pressures (LV-EDP) were measured. Peak velocity during early filling (E) and v(p) were extracted by digital analysis of color M-mode Doppler images. RESULTS: In both animals and humans, LV-EDV and LV-EDP decreased significantly from baseline to IVC occlusion (both p < 0.001). Peak early filling (E) velocity decreased in animals from 56 \u00b1 21 to 42 \u00b1 17 cm/s (p < 0.001) without change in v(p) (from 35 \u00b1 15 to 35 \u00b1 16, p = 0.99). Results were similar in humans (from 69 \u00b1 15 to 53 \u00b1 22 cm/s, p < 0.001, and 37 \u00b1 12 to 34 \u00b1 16, p = 0.30). In both species, there was a strong correlation between LV relaxation (tau) and v(p) (r = 0.78, p < 0.001, r = 0.86, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that color M-mode Doppler v(p) is not affected by preload alterations and confirms that LV relaxation is its main physiologic determinant in both animals during varying lusitropic conditions and in humans with heart disease.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: E colicin proteins have three functional domains, each of which is implicated in one of the stages of killing Escherichia coli cells: receptor binding, translocation and cytotoxicity. The central (R) domain is responsible for receptor-binding activity whereas the N-terminal (T) domain mediates translocation, the process by which the C-terminal cytotoxic domain is transported from the receptor to the site of its cytotoxicity. The translocation of enzymatic E colicins like colicin E9 is dependent upon TolB but the details of the process are not known. Results: We have demonstrated a protein-protein interaction between the T domain of colicin E9 and TolB, an essential component of the tol-dependent translocation system in E. coli, using the yeast two-hybrid system. The crystal structure of TolB, a procaryotic tryptophan-aspartate (WD) repeat protein, reveals an N-terminal \u03b1+\u03b2 domain based on a five-stranded mixed \u03b2 sheet and a C-terminal six- bladed \u03b2-propeller domain. Conclusions: The results suggest that the TolB- box residues of the T domain of colicin E9 interact with the \u03b2-propeller domain of TolB. The protein-protein interactions of other \u03b2-propeller- containing proteins, the yeast yPrp4 protein and G proteins, are mediated by the loops or outer sheets of the propeller blades. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the T domain-TolB complex and the isolation of mutations in TolB that abolish the interaction with the T domain will reveal fine details of the protein-protein interaction of TolB and the T domain of E colicins.",

The treatment of rectal cancer involves the use of neoadjuvant and postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Patient selection for neoadjuvant therapy relies on the use of computed tomography and endorectal ultrasound staging. Overall staging is determined by the depth of tumor penetration (generally referred to as T stage), the presence or absence of nodal involvement (N stage), and distant metastases (M stage). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the only staging modality that provides direct visualization of the normal 5 layers of the rectal wall. Furthermore, perirectal lymphadenopathy can be clearly imaged.

METHODS: General descriptive statistics were obtained from Medicare inpatient claims data by year, endoscopy grouping, diagnosis related group code, and principal diagnosis code. From abstracted clinical data, associations were derived for length of stay, readmission rates, and the following processes of care: screening or treatment for Helicobacter pylori; screening for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use; and the performance of endoscopy. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation method was used to estimate patient health status for the study. RESULTS: During the 6-yr study, there were 878,212 claims, which constituted 1.3% of the total Medicare claims. The total Medicare payment for peptic ulcer claims was estimated at $4.8 billion. The inpatient mortality rate was 4.5%. Readmission rates remained relatively constant during the study period but decreased significantly when NSAID screening was documented during the hospitalization. Admission rates, length of stay, and mortality declined progressively during the study period. A reduction in length of stay of approximately I day was observed when screening or treatment for H. pylori, screening for NSAID use, or the performance of endoscopy was documented. CONCLUSIONS: Peptic ulcer disease has an important impact on the Medicare population with respect to cost, recurrence, and mortality. Adherence to selected processes of care is associated with shorter length of stay and lower readmission rates.",

After accounting for the observed needle trajectories of the planned needles, 14 of 15 patients (93%) required additional sources to achieve the desired coverage of the target volume.Conclusion: A brachytherapy implant procedure which provides clinically significant advances has been implemented. Specifically, the planning system allows dosimetric validation of the needle placement. This procedure is effective in delivering brachytherapy to the target volume and assuring that the implant is delivered in accordance with the preplan. The dosimetric feedback could be incorporated in ultrasound-guided implants. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "Australia's National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil and Other Noxious and Hazardous Substances (the National Plan) has operated since 1973. The objectives of the National Plan are based on Australia's obligations as a signatory to the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation 1990 and a responsibility to protect natural and artificial (man made) environments from the adverse effects of oil pollution and minimise those effects where protection is not possible. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is the managing agency of the National Plan, working together with the States and Northern Territory governments, other Commonwealth agencies, ports, and the shipping, oil and exploration industries, to maximise Australia's marine pollution response capability. The 1990s have been a period of significant change for oil spill response arrangements in Australia. The National Plan was extended in 1998 to cover chemical spills and is currently in the process of implementing the oil spill response incident control system (OSRICS). A fixed wing aerial dispersant spraying capability was implemented in 1996 and a research and development program has been put in place. The development of a computer-based National Oil Spill Response Atlas was a major project completed during 1999. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

IL-6 exerts its activity through its binding to specific high affinity receptors at the surface of target cells. As yet, no molecular data have been reported for the beluga whale IL-6. In this study, we cloned and determined the entire beluga whale IL-6-encoding cDNA sequence by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sequencing, and analysed its genetic relationship with those from several mammalian species including human, rodent, ruminant, carnivore and other marine species. The identity levels of beluga whale IL-6 nucleic and deduced amino acid sequences with those from these mammalian species ranged from 62.3 to 97.3%, and 42.9 to 95.6%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences showed that the beluga whale IL-6 was most closely related to that of the killer whale. Thereafter, beluga whale IL-6-encoding sequence was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli by using the pTHIOHisA expression vector for the production of a recombinant fusion protein. The immunogenicity of the recombinant fusion protein was then confirmed as determined by the production of a beluga whale IL-6-specific rabbit antiserum. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The present study attempted to delineate further characteristics of men with PE and to address a number of presumed hypotheses regarding the etiology of this disorder. Methods: Twenty-six men with PE were compared with an age-matched group of 13 sexually functional men on multiple indices of erectile and ejaculatory response during coital and masturbatory activities. These data were collected through retrospective, prospective, and laboratory methods. Results: Psychophysiological testing indicated greater ejaculatory vulnerability to penile stimulation, although not visual erotic stimulation, in PE men than functional controls. PE men also showed subtle anomalies in the way they perceived their somatic response. The correlation between measures of ejaculatory latency and control was positive and high for intercourse, but low or even negative for masturbation. Whereas functional men showed consistency in ejaculatory latency over coital and masturbatory activities, PE men exhibited much shorter latencies during coitus than masturbation. Data collected under various methodologies (retrospective, prospective, and laboratory) showed greater consistency among sexually functional subjects; and preliminary analysis of laboratory data suggests psychophysiological methodology is as effective in differentiating dysfunctional from functional men as prospective and retrospective methodologies. Conclusion: Although ejaculatory latency and control tend to be related, these measures are not always stable over different kinds of sexual activity or using different methods of data collection. Psychophysiological methodology is effective in differentiating group membership (PE vs. control), but does not predict individual ejaculatory responses measured prospectively.

        "Absrtact": "The clue to understanding the pathophysiology of complex traits such as multiple sclerosis, heart disease, cancer and psychiatric disease begins with the idea that all of these traits have an underlying continuously variable (over time) pathophysiology of subclinical expression. At a particular point in time, a threshold is crossed and the continuous variable is recognized as being discontinuous. As defined in the field of quantitative genetics, this variable, liability, consists of genetic and environmental components. In this paper, I review key concepts necessary to understand these disorders at the genetic level. The genetic components consist of susceptibility loci with a particular strength which interact with another. These interactions are described mathematically using our previous and current work on the ternary complex [HLA, T-cell receptor (TcR)] loci. I then discuss how the Th1 versus Th2 immunological pathway will undoubtedly depend in large part on the genetic loci inherited. Finally, strategies are presented which allow one to develop an integral view of liability using the technological counterpart of each \"wave\" of the genotypic and phenotypic components of pathophysiology. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

        "Absrtact": "Previous studies have suggested the presence of multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes in guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle, although the relative abundance and functional role of these subtypes remains an area of significant research efforts. The present study utilized both radioligand kinetic and functional experiments to further probe the nature of the muscarinic receptors in gallbladder smooth muscle and their mode of coupling to intra- and extra-cellular Ca2+ sources. Dissociation kinetic studies using [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) indicated that the binding profile in guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle could not be reconciled with that expected for a single muscarinic receptor subtype, the latter determined in parallel experiments conducted on the cloned muscarinic M1-M5 subtypes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Furthermore, comparison of the gallbladder data with the dissociation characteristics of [3H]NMS in guinea pig urinary bladder revealed a significantly different kinetic profile, with the urinary bladder, but not the gallbladder, demonstrating biphasic radioligand dissociation kinetics. In functional experiments, carbachol caused a concentration-dependent contraction of guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle strips in Ca2+-free or 5 mM Sr2+-substituted physiological salt solutions (PSS) with amplitudes of the maximal contractions corresponding to 45.8\u00b18.0% and 33.2\u00b16.6% of control responses in normal PSS, respectively. Furthermore, the stimulus-response characteristics of carbachol-mediated contraction appeared significantly altered in Ca2+-free PSS relative to normal or Sr2+-substituted PSS. The antagonist, methoctramine (1x10-7-3x10-5 M), exerted only a slight inhibition of carbachol (10-5 M)-induced contractions in 5 mM Sr2+-substituted medium, whereas it was significantly more potent in antagonizing gallbladder contractions in response to 10-5 M carbachol in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Both atropine and tripitramine were equipotent in antagonizing carbachol-induced contractions in Ca2+-free (pIC50: 6.85\u00b10.11 for atropine and 5.75\u00b10.32 for tripitramine) and Sr2+-substituted media (pIC50: 6.88\u00b10.25 for atropine and 5.70\u00b10.16 for tripitramine), and pirenzepine was only slightly more potent in Ca2+-free PSS (pIC50: 5.66\u00b10.23) than in Sr2+-substituted PSS (pIC50: 5.33\u00b10.21). Taken together, our data indicate that carbachol contracts guinea pig gallbladder by stimulating two distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes linked to extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release. These two subtypes may represent the muscarinic M3 and M4 receptors, although the presence of the muscarinic M2 receptor subtype is also suggested from the binding data.

        "Absrtact": "Lowermost Silurian organic-rich ('hot') shales are the origin of 80-90% of Palaeozoic sourced hydrocarbons in North Africa and also played a major role in petroleum generation on the Arabian Peninsula. In most cases, the shales were deposited directly above upper Ordovician (peri-) glacial sandstones during the initial early Silurian transgression that was a result of the melting of the late Ordovician icecap. Deposition of the main organic-rich shale unit in the North African/Arabian region was restricted to the earliest Silurian Rhuddanian stage (acuminatus, atavus and probably early cyphus graptolite biozones). During this short period (1-2 m.y.), a favourable combination of factors existed which led to the development of exceptionally strong oxygen-deficiency in the area. In most countries of the study area, the post-Rhuddanian Silurian shales are organically lean and have not contributed to petroleum generation. The distribution and thickness of the basal Silurian 'hot' shales have been mapped in detail for the whole North African region, using logs from some 300 exploration wells in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. In addition, all relevant, accessible published and unpublished surface and subsurface data of the lower Silurian shales in North Africa and Arabia have been reviewed, including sedimentological, biostratigraphic and organic geochemical data. The lowermost Silurian hot shales of northern Gondwana are laterally discontinuous and their distribution and thickness were controlled by the early Silurian palaeorelief which was shaped mainly by glacial processes of the late Ordovician ice age and by Pan-African and Infracambrian compressional and extensional tectonism. The thickest and areally most extensive basal Silurian organic-rich shales in North Africa occur in Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya, while on the Arabian Peninsula they are most prolific in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Iraq. The hot shales were not deposited in Egypt, which was a large palaeohigh at that time. The depositional model presented may help in better understanding the source potential of the basal Silurian shales in less-explored regions of North Africa and Arabia including Morocco, northern Niger and the Kufra Basin in southeast Libya.

        "Absrtact": "Inspired by the idea that regime switching may give rise to persistence that is observationally equivalent to a unit root, we derive a regime switching process that exhibits long memory. The feature of the process that generates long memory is a heavy-tailed duration distribution. Using this process for volatility, we obtain a regime switching stochastic volatility (RSSV) model that we fit to daily S&P returns from 1928 through 1995 by means of the efficient method of moments estimation (EMM) method. Forecasts of RSSV volatility given past returns can be generated by reprojection, as we illustrate. The RSSV model is accepted according to the EMM chi-squared statistic. Using this statistic, we also evaluate several other models that have been proposed in the literature and some modifications to them. We find that models that exhibit long memory in volatility and heavy tails conditionally, as does the RSSV model, fit the data, whereas models without these characteristics do not. We also find weak evidence that suggests the presence of an additional short memory component of volatility over and above the long memory component. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Although the Sr and Nd isotopic ratios are similar to those in normal mid ocean ridge basalt, the incompatible element signatures and Pb isotopic compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 18.7-19.8) show similarities to the high time integrated 238U/204Pb mantle component. On the 206Pb/204Pb versus 207Pb/204Pb isotope diagram, all samples plot below the Northern Hemisphere reference line (\u0394 7/4=-1.0 to -7.2) and form a 430 Ma isochron. The Pb, as well as Sm-Nd, isotope data are consistent with the presence of recycled Paleozoic (\u2264500 Ma) oceanic crust in the Madeira source. Variations in major element and isotopic geochemistry (e.g. positive correlation between SiO2 and FeO(T) with Pb isotope ratios in primitive samples) point to a heterogeneous plume source containing upper (primarily hydrothermally altered basaltic) and lower (primarily unaltered gabbroic) ocean crust and lithospheric mantle. The more fertile basaltic crustal component is preferentially sampled during the shield stage of volcanism, whereas the more depleted lower crust and lithospheric mantle components are preferentially sampled during the post-erosional stage. We propose that plume material becomes progressively depleted through melt extraction as it spreads out along the base of the lithosphere in the direction of plate motion. A systematic decrease in 143Nd/144Nd and increase in 207Pb/204Pb isotopic ratios with increasing age along the hotspot track and proximity to the Iberian peninsula are attributed to increased contamination by continental lithosphere.

        "Absrtact": "The morphometric analysis of submarine landslides in four distinctly different tectonic environments on the continental slopes of Oregon, central California, Texas, and New Jersey provides useful insight into submarine process, including sediment transport mechanisms and slope stability. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) software, we identify landslides from multibeam bathymetric and GLORIA sidescan surveys based solely on surficial morphology and reflectivity. This method provides useful data in a time- and cost-efficient manner. We measure various aspects of the failures, including landslide area, runout distance, and headscarp height, along with the slope gradient of the runout zone, the failure's scar, headscarp, and adjacent slopes. The largest failures of the four study areas occur in the Gulf of Mexico, adjacent to Mississippi Canyon, and between salt withdrawal basins. Smaller landslides occur within the basins, and at the base of the Sigsbee Escarpment. These smaller landslides tend to have higher headscarps than the larger ones, and often have cohesive material at the base, suggesting a stronger rheology. Oregon has the steepest local slopes, but surprisingly few large failures for a seismically active margin (especially in the north), implying that slope angle and seismic activity may not be the most important slope stability controls. The California continental slope is heavily incised, which makes failure isolation difficult. Most of the landslides occur within the larger canyons (Vizcaino, Pioneer, Monterey) and adjacent to a pock mark field in the Point Arena basin. The majority of landslides offshore New Jersey occur on the open slope between Lindenkohl and Carteret Canyons. Morphometric statistics give us insight into where mass movements occur, how big they are likely to be, their relative importance as sediment transport mechanisms, and the overall slope stability of a given margin. Most landslides occur on slopes less than 10\u00b0. Curiously, the steepness of the slope adjacent to the failure tends to be inversely proportional to the runout length. In both California and Oregon, slope failures tend to make the local slope steeper, whereas failures in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore New Jersey will tend to make the local slope less steep. Landslides with rubble beneath the scar are mostly smaller than those without, are deep seated, and make the slope steeper. We use the ratio of headscarp height to runout length as a measure of the failure's dynamic rheology. This ratio in the submarine case is orders of magnitude less than subaerial landslides. Hydroplaning of the failed mass may be responsible for the very long runout lengths. These morphometric relationships give us important insight into landslide dynamics and process in different sedimentary and tectonic environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Similarly, the bis(trifluoroacetate) [Ru(\u03b71-O2CCF3)2(\u03ba 2-iPr2PCH2PiPr2)2] (7) was prepared and the molecular structure determined by X-ray crystallography.

        "Absrtact": "Recently, Jirsa et al. and Haken discussed a theory comprising the brain wave equation proposed by Nunez, the Wilson-Cowan/Ermentrout-Cowan model, and Hopfield networks. This theory was applied to model findings obtained in an experiment that relates brain activity and behavior, the so-called Julliard experiment. In previous works of Jirsa et al. and Frank et al. the focus was on the brain wave aspect. Recently, we conducted similar experiments. The results obtained are modeled in this paper in terms of coupled oscillator systems. Coupled oscillator systems are considered to represent the Wilson-Cowan/Ermentrout-Cowan-model aspect of the unifying theory. Building on a model proposed by Haken, Kelso, and Bunz and the theory of weakly coupled oscillators established by Winfree and by Kuramoto, we derive a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation whose stationary solutions mimic the neocortical brain activity observed in our experiments. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "We study two new problems in sequence alignment both from a practical and a theoretical view, using tools from combinatorial optimization to develop branch-and-cut algorithms. The generalized maximum trace formulation captures several forms of multiple sequence alignment problems in a common framework, among them the original formulation of maximum trace. The RNA sequence alignment problem captures the comparison of RNA molecules on the basis of their primary sequence and their secondary structure. Both problems have a characterization in terms of graphs which we reformulate in terms of integer linear programming. We then study the polytopes (or convex hulls of all feasible solutions) associated with the integer linear program for both problems. For each polytope we derive several classes of facet-defining inequalities and show that for some of these classes the corresponding separation problem can be solved in polynomial time. This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment that is not based on dynamic programming. Moreover, for multiple sequences the branch-and-cut algorithms for both sequence alignment problems are able to solve to optimality instances that are beyond the range of present dynamic programming approaches. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Also, the data show that cross-country differences in legal and accounting systems help account for differences in financial development. Together, these findings suggest that legal and accounting reforms that strengthen creditor rights, contract enforcement, and accounting practices can boost financial development and accelerate economic growth.",

        "Absrtact": "A method for precise Pb analysis using a 207Pb-204Pb spike has been developed at Royal Holloway. Pb isotope ratios are calculated relative to 206Pb and are normalised in a run to an arbitrary 208Pb/206Pb ratio to permit good estimates of error propagation through the fractionation correction. While 204Pb/206Pb normalised to 208Pb/206Pb appears free from interferences and obeys power- or exponential-law mass fractionation within analytical error. 207Pb/206Pb shows systematic decreases with increase in 208Pb/206Pb at > 1250\u00b0C that are extremely difficult to explain by isobaric interference and may indicate abnormal mass fractionation behaviour. However, this behaviour is absent from plasma-source mass spectrometers. Correction for the effect improves external reproducibility of SRM981 from 96 to 82 ppm (1 sd. 33 analyses over 1 year) for 206Pb/204Pb, and from 64 to 43 ppm for 207Pb/206Pb. For 206Pb/204Pb, this external reproducibility is only about twice the typical internal error on a single analysis after error propagation through the fractionation correction. Relative to the fractionation-corrected isotope ratios, measured ratios for unknown samples analysed are significantly more enriched in the lighter isotopes than are runs of SRM981, indicating that corrections based on average SRM981 mass fractionation are likely to be in error. Acid-leached rock chips and acid-leached powders generally give identical Pb ratios within analytical error. However, re-analysis of samples previously published by several laboratories shows large differences, up to 30 X the supposed reproducibility of conventional Pb isotope determinations, probably related both to inadequate fractionation corrections and to environmental contamination of rock powder.",

        "Absrtact": "The Lamongan volcanic field (LVF) in East Java, Indonesia, consists of up to 61 basaltic cinder or spatter cones, a minimum of 29 prehistoric maars, and a central compound complex comprising three main vents including the historically active Lamongan volcano. The field lies on the Sunda volcanic arc and abuts onto the currently active Tengger caldera-Semeru complex to the west. Between 1799 and 1898, Lamongan was persistently active and discharged up to 15 lava flows of basaltic to basaltic andesite composition, which is probably more than what was erupted by any other Indonesian volcano in that period. Several seismic crises have been recorded in the LVF since Lamongan's last eruption. There are no existing records of cinder cone or maar-forming eruptions in the area. Despite the possible hazards posed by future activity in the LVF, the history and structure of the field have been subject to little scrutiny. This contribution presents the results of a detailed morphometric and volumetric investigation of prehistoric vents and historic lava flows in the LVF, using field data, historic records, satellite imagery and modelling of erupted volumes. A typical LVF maar is characterised as a crater with a diameter of 450 m; generated by an eruption with a model ejecta volume of 0.016 km3 dense rock equivalent (DRE) and a model juvenile component volume of 0.0096 km3 DRE. Diameter/depth ratios of some maars display a morphological freshness comparable to recently formed phreatomagmatic eruption craters elsewhere. The median LVF cinder/spatter cone has a basal diameter of 600 m, a height of 75 m, a volume of 0.009 km3 and a model total erupted volume of 0.014 km3. Variation in cone basal diameter to height ratios indicates that the age of some prehistoric cones may not exceed a few centuries, and morphological classification identifies the youngest prehistoric vents on the northern flanks of the central edifice. Historic activity from vents on the western flanks of Lamongan produced at least ~0.05 km3 of basaltic to basaltic andesite lava. Resurfacing rates at Lamongan in the 19th Century imply an age of ~ 900-2100 years for the surface of the volcano. The steady-state eruptive rate from 1843-1898 is evaluated as 0.025 m3 s-1, which is low in comparison to estimates from many presently active systems. Using eruptive rate and volume data, the age of the LVF is estimated as between 13 and 40 ka, placing it among the youngest dated Indonesian volcanoes. Complex regional tectonics in conjunction with magmatic pressure have probably been the major influences on the distribution of volcanism in the LVF. The occurrence of maar-forming eruptions may have been controlled by a porous substrate, possibly a deposit from the Holocene Iyang-Argapura complex to the east. Volcanic hazards from future eruptions in the LVF include base surges, ash flows, ashfall and ejected blocks associated with phreatomagmatic activity, and ashfall and ejecta from magmatic eruptions.

        "Absrtact": "The magnitudes and epicenters of Philippine earthquakes from 1589 to 1895 are estimated based on the review, evaluation and interpretation of historical accounts and descriptions. The first step involves the determination of magnitude-felt area relations for the Philippines for use in the magnitude estimation. Data used were the earthquake reports of 86, recent, shallow events with well-described effects and known magnitude values. Intensities are assigned according to the modified Mercalli intensity scale of I to XII. The areas enclosed by Intensities III to IX [A(III) to A(IX)] are measured and related to magnitude values. The most robust relations are found for magnitudes relating to A(VI), A(VII), A(VIII) and A(IX). Historical earthquake data are obtained from primary sources in libraries in the Philippines and Spain. Most of these accounts were made by Spanish priests and officials stationed in the Philippines during the 15th to 19th centuries. More than 3000 events are catalogued, interpreted and their intensities determined by considering the possible effects of local site conditions, type of construction and the number and locations of existing towns to assess completeness of reporting. Of these events, 485 earthquake with the largest number of accounts or with at least a minimum report of damage are selected. The historical epicenters are estimated based on the resulting generalized isoseimal maps augmented by information on recent seismicity and location of known tectonic structures. Their magnitudes are estimated by using the previously determined magnitude-felt area equations for recent events. Although historical epicenters are mostly found to lie on known tectonic structures, a few, however, are found to lie along structures that show not much activity during the instrumented period. A comparison of the magnitude distributions of historical and recent events showed that only the period 1850 to 1900 may be considered well-reported in terms of magnitude distribution. Each earthquake is evaluated for its 'quality' of determination based on the number of intensity reports. Earlier than 1850, the data collected are few and most earthquakes had fewer than ten reports. Good quality reports began to be collected from 1850, partly correlative to an increase in the number of towns and partly to the start of a systematized collection of earthquake accounts by the Manila Observatory. Parameters of these well-reported earthquakes may be used for conducting various seismological studies. Examples of how the parameters of poorly reported events were arrived at are also discussed.

Similarly, although neurons in sub-cortical auditory areas of other species have been classified into distinct categories, these criteria have not been applied in primates. This study measured the responses of single neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI) and the caudomedial field (CM) to tones and noise. Most neurons could be qualitatively classified as onset, sustained, or sustained-onset, but never as primary (VIII nerve)-like or chopper. Quantitative analysis showed a continuum of response types, from having only onset responses to responding throughout the stimulus period. AI neurons had higher firing rates that CM neurons, but CM neurons had higher firing rates to noise stimuli compared to tone stimuli, and a greater percentage of CM neurons had excitatory responses after stimulus offset. There were no differences in the percentage of neurons that had tonic or inhibitory responses. These results indicate that the responses of neurons in the primate auditory cortex are better described as a continuum rather than as discrete classes, and provide further evidence that auditory information is processed in series between AI and CM in the primate.

In this paper, we propose a novel technique for implementing multiple sharing granularities over page-based DSMS. We present protocols for efficient switching between small and large sharing units during runtime. We show that applications may benefit from adapting the memory sharing to the memory access pattern, using both coarse grain sharing and fine grain sharing interchangeably in different stages of the computation.

The qualification was done using electrophysiologically well known neural activities in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices stained with externally applied fluorescent voltage- sensitive dye (VSD; Di-4-ANEPPS). Together with a newly designed CCD-based digital high-speed camera system and epi-fluorescent optics, our improvements were made on a protocol for staining using a newly designed chamber system. These improvements enabled us to make stable and reliable recordings of optical signals and electrophysiological measurements without affecting the physiological status and to make a quantitative comparison between them. The time course and amplitude of the optical signal showed fair agreement with intracellular and extracellular recordings, and was stable over 2 h. The optical signal followed synaptically induced long-term potentiation (LTP) as monitored by the electrophysiological signals. A regional difference in the amount of LTP was found in optical signals and was confirmed in the electrophysiological signals. These results demonstrate the capabilities of our improved method as an alternative but more potent tool to measure the neuronal activities of brain slice in addition to electrophysiological method. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "To investigate synaptic mechanisms underlying information processing in auditory cortex, we examined cholinergic modulation of synaptic transmission in a novel slice preparation containing thalamocortical and intracortical inputs to mouse auditory cortex. Extracellular and intracellular recordings were made in cortical layer IV while alternately stimulating thalamocortical afferents (via medial geniculate or downstream subcortical stimulation) and intracortical afferents. Either subcortical or intracortical stimulation elicited a fast, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)-sensitive, monosynaptic EPSP followed by long-duration, polysynaptic activity. The cholinergic agonist carbachol suppressed each of the synaptic potentials to different degrees. At low concentrations (5 \u03bcM) carbachol strongly reduced (>60%) the polysynaptic slow potentials for both pathways but did not affect the monosynaptic fast potentials. At higher doses (10-50 \u03bcM), carbachol also reduced the fast potentials, but reduced the intracortically-elicited fast potential significantly more than the thalamocortically-elicited fast potential, which at times was actually enhanced. Atropine (0.5 \u03bcM) blocked the effects of carbachol, indicating muscarinic receptor involvement. We conclude that muscarinic modulation can strongly suppress intracortical synaptic activity while exerting less suppression, or actually enhancing, thalamocortical inputs. Such differential actions imply that auditory information processing may favor sensory information relayed through the thalamus over ongoing cortical activity during periods of increased acetylcholine (ACh) release.

        "Absrtact": "The unbiased sampling techniques of stereology have been developed to avoid the inaccuracies of using 'representative' sections for morphometric studies. In order to carry out a stereologically valid study, the region of interest must be fully available for sampling and its boundaries or its constituents must also be distinctly identifiable. However, in the setting of a brain bank in which only one half of the brain specimen is fixed for morphology, a logistic problem arises in satisfying the needs of the diagnostic neuropathologist with that of the stereologically oriented morphologist. We present a dissection approach in which the region for analysis must be used for unbiased sampling and also be available for paraffin-embedded neuropathologic work-up. Following fixation, a block consisting of the entire region of interest is removed intact and using a multibladed knife the block is subsectioned in the coronal plane at regular intervals. Alternate blocks are chosen for either paraffin embedding and destined to neuropathologic evaluation or are processed for stereology. The stereology blocks can be either cryoprotected or placed in phosphate buffer and are serially sectioned on a cryostat or a Vibratome. Preliminary analyses using this approach have provided reliable estimates of the total number of different neuronal populations and disease-related lesions in a variety of human and non-human banked specimens. In addition, this approach has definite advantages in that it provides rigorous quantitative estimates of neuropathologic changes that can be correlated to clinical data and does not compromise the routine neuropathological diagnostic procedure of the materials.

        "Absrtact": "In the first part, the authors discuss the mechanical stability of dominant and suppressed Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) grown under differing thinning regimes with a focus on the stem shape and the mechanical properties of the standing tree. In the second part, they concentrate on the variation of the modulus of elasticity of green wood (MOE(fresh)) and the density within the stem to analyse the effect of the underlying patterns in variation of these wood properties on the mechanics of the entire stem. At the standing-tree level, the investigations comprised a morphological description and static bending tests on the trees to measure flexural stiffness and structural Young's modulus of the stem. Discs sampled from different stem heights were examined to distinguish between different tissues (cortex, wood, pith) and wood types (adult, adolescent, juvenile), and to measure quantitatively their contribution to the axial second moment of area of the stem. An analysis of the variation of density and MOE(fresh) within the stem was carried out on small wood samples cut out of stem sections taken from the same height as the stem discs. The flexural stiffness of the trees is mainly influenced by stem radius, resulting in a higher flexural stiffness for thicker trees. Independently from the stem dimensions, the structural Young's modulus was slightly higher for the suppressed trees within each site. In an individual tree the structural Young's modulus decreases with increasing stem height. The cross-sectional analyses of wood type proportions and their characterisation by density and MOE(fresh) showed that the distribution of adult, adolescent and juvenile wood within the stem affects the structural Young's modulus and the flexural stiffness of the stem. Finally, a method is presented that allows a re-calculation of the mechanical bending properties of the entire standing trees using MOE and axial second moments of area of the different wood types. Our results suggest that further modelling of mechanical behaviour of trees might be possible taking into account the composite nature of conifer stems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Expressed sequence tags from the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus were generated in order to identify anchor loci for comparative mapping between nematode genomes and candidate targets for future control measures. In total, 370 SL1 trans-spliced cDNAs from different developmental stages representing 195 different genes were partially sequenced. From these expressed sequence tags 50% were similar to genes with a known or predicted function and 19% were similar to nematode sequences with no ascribed function. From the first, free-living L1 and L3 stages relatively many cDNAs matched to housekeeping genes, and 11% (L1) or 23% (L3) of the encoded proteins were predicted to contain signal peptides. In contrast, no function could be ascribed to most of the cDNAs from the early L5 and adult parasitic stages, but for 30% (L5) or 55% (adult) of the encoded proteins a signal sequence was predicted. This limited analysis suggests that during the transition from the free-living to parasitic stages gene expression shifts towards the synthesis of less conserved extracellular proteins. These proteins offer the best perspectives for vaccine development and the development of anthelmintic drugs. In contrast, cDNAs from the first larval stages may be most suitable for comparative mapping with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems are characterized by a diverse community of native groundcover species. Critics of plantation forestry claim that loblolly (Pinus taeda) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii) forests are devoid of native groundcover due to associated management practices. As a result of these practices, some believe that ecosystem functions characteristic of longleaf pine are lost under loblolly and slash pine plantation management. Our objective was to quantify and compare vegetation composition and structure of longleaf, loblolly, and slash pine forests of differing ages, management strategies, and land-use histories. Information from this study will further our understanding and lead to inferences about functional differences among pine cover types. Vegetation and environmental data were collected in 49 overstory plots across Southlands Experiment Forest in Bainbridge, GA. Nested plots, i.e. midstory, understory, and herbaceous, were replicated four times within each overstory plot. Over 400 species were identified. Herbaceous species richness was variable for all three pine cover types. Herbaceous richness for longleaf, slash, and loblolly pine averaged 15, 13, and 12 species per m2, respectively. Longleaf pine plots had significantly more (p < 0.029) herbaceous species and greater herbaceous cover (p < 0.001) than loblolly or slash pine plots. Longleaf and slash pine plots were otherwise similar in species richness and stand structure, both having lower overstory density, midstory density, and midstory cover than loblolly pine plots. Multivariate analyses provided additional perspectives on vegetation patterns. Ordination and classification procedures consistently placed herbaceous plots into two groups which we refer to as longleaf pine benchmark (34 plots) and non-benchmark (15 plots). Benchmark plots typically contained numerous herbaceous species characteristic of relic longleaf pine/wiregrass communities found in the area. Conversely, non-benchmark plots contained fewer species characteristic of relic longleaf pine/wiregrass communities and more ruderal species common to highly disturbed sites. The benchmark group included 12 naturally regenerated longleaf plots and 22 loblolly, slash, and longleaf pine plantation plots encompassing a broad range of silvicultural disturbances. Non-benchmark plots included eight afforested old-field plantation plots and seven cutover plantation plots. Regardless of overstory species, all afforested old fields were low either in native species richness or in abundance. Varying degrees of this groundcover condition were also found in some cutover plantation plots that were classified as non-benchmark. Environmental variables strongly influencing vegetation patterns included agricultural history and fire frequency. Results suggest that land-use history, particularly related to agriculture, has a greater influence on groundcover composition and structure in southern pine forests than more recent forest management activities or pine cover type. Additional research is needed to identify the potential for afforested old fields to recover native herbaceous species. In the interim, high-yield plantation management should initially target old-field sites which already support reduced numbers of groundcover species. Sites which have not been farmed in the past 50-60 years should be considered for longleaf pine restoration and multiple-use objectives, since they have the greatest potential for supporting diverse native vegetation.

In the first two experiments, brain activation was measured while subjects viewed morphed versions of either their own (self face exp.) or their partner's face (partner's face exp.), alternating in blocks with presentation of an unknown face. In the self face exp. right limbic areas (hippocampal formation, insula, anterior cingulate), the right middle temporal lobe, left inferior parietal and left prefrontal regions showed signal changes. In the partner's face exp., only the right insula was activated. In the third exp., subjects made decisions about psychological trait adjectives previously categorized as describing their own attributes. Activation was present in the precuneus, the left parietal lobe, left insula/inferior frontal gyrus and the left anterior cingulate. A reaction time advantage was present when subjects responded to self-relevant words. The main area with signal changes during self-reference processing, regardless of the type of stimulus, was the left fusiform gyrus. The self-relevant stimuli engaged to a differential extent long term and working memory, semantic and emotional processes. We suggest that regions activated by these stimuli are engaged in self-processing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "In this study, variations in Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios in a Holocene Belgian speleothem (cave secondary carbonate deposit) are interpreted in terms of changes in water residence time and changes in weathering processes, possibly induced by changes in West European climate. A stalagmite from the Pere Noel cave (Belgium) was dated with the TIMS U/Th method and was deposited between ~ 13 and ~ 2 ka BP. The 1000 Mg/Ca ratio varies between 4.9 and 26, and displays short-term changes but no significant long-term trend. The 1000 Sr/Ca ratio varies between 0.09 and 0.31 and displays both short-term changes and a long-term decreasing trend from 12.9 to 3.5 ka. In parallel, the Sr isotopic composition of the speleothem decreases from 0.7090 at 12.9 ka to 0.7088 at 3.5 ka. The Sr isotope ratio is higher than expected from the overlying limestone (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7081) which implies an external source of radiogenic Sr, most probably from a silicate phase. Short-term and long-term changes in Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca as well as long-term changes of 87Sr/86Sr ratios can be explained by changes in the dissolution and precipitation processes of the host limestone. These processes are controlled by changes in water residence times linked to changes in the water excess (precipitation minus evapo-transpiration). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Reconstructions based on these and recently published rotation parameters document a relatively stationary position of Broken Ridge abutted against Central Kerguelen Plateau between chron 34 (83 Ma) and chron 20 (43 Ma), prior to the commencement of seafloor spreading between the two Late Cretaceous features. These reconstructions are significant as they are the first which are consistent with geological and geophysical constraints in not producing an overlap of Broken Ridge and Kerguelen Plateau between chron 34 and chron 24 (53 Ma) and not requiring significant extension or strike-slip motion within Kerguelen Plateau. We also find that the finite rotations for chrons 20 to 34 outline the area of rough topography inferred from the satellite-derived free-air gravity for the Diamantina Zone and Labuan Basin. A consequence of these rotations is that there is considerable overlap of continental crust in the region of Tasmania, the South Tasman Rise and East Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous. Solutions to this problem may imply either post-Santonian (\u226479 Ma) extension or transform motion in the Bass Strait, or late Cretaceous or Cenozoic extension in Wilkes Land. The reconstructions also agree with prior estimates of roughly 150 km of motion between East and West Antartica since chron 20. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Previous in vitro selection experiments identified an RNA aptamer that recognizes the chromophore malachite green (MG) with a high level of affinity, and which undergoes site-specific cleavage following laser irradiation. To understand the mechanism by which this RNA folds to recognize specifically its ligand and the structural basis for chromophore-assisted laser inactivation, we have determined the 2.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of the aptamer bound to tetramethylrosamine (TMR), a high-affinity MG analog. The ligand-binding site is defined by an asymmetric internal loop, flanked by a pair of helices. A U-turn and several non-canonical base interactions stabilize the folding of loop nucleotides around the TMR. The aptamer utilizes several tiers of stacked nucleotides arranged in pairs, triples, and a novel base quadruple to effectively encapsulate the ligand. Even in the absence of specific stabilizing hydrogen bonds, discrimination between related fluorophores and chromophores is possible due to tight packing in the RNA binding pocket, which severely limits the size and shape of recognized ligands. The site of laser-induced cleavage lies relatively far from the bound TMR (~15 \u00c5). The unusual backbone conformation of the cleavage site nucleotide and its high level of solvent accessibility may combine to allow preferential reaction with freely diffusing hydroxyl radicals generated at the bound ligand. Several observations, however, favor alternative mechanisms for cleavage, such as conformational changes in the aptamer or long-range electron transfer between the bound ligand and the cleavage site nucleotide.

        "Absrtact": "Linyphiid spiders are important generalist predators of insects in agricultural habitats. Their ability to rapidly disperse and colonise disturbed habitats makes them important as a natural form of pest control, often present before other predatory groups arrive. This paper examines the distribution of Erigone atra and E. dentipalpis, which are amongst the commonest linyphiid species to be found on agricultural land in Scotland. The habitat preferences of these species were assessed using abundance and proportion data from 71 independent sites sampled using pitfall traps over 2 years and a selection of repeat first-year sites sampled during the second year, incorporating a range of land-uses from extensive moorland, through grasslands to intensive arable fields. E. atra dominated in autumn sown crops, and E. dentipalpis dominated at the other end of the agricultural management spectrum in low-intensity grasslands. Both species were considered absent from upland and moorland habitats. Linear regression modelling was used to create a model which best estimated the variance in proportions of E. atra in the catch across the sites using a selection of vegetation, soil, management and landscape variables. This model was based on data from 58 sites where Erigone species were abundant and explained 66% of the variation in E. atra. The variables included were increasing vegetation biomass above 50 mm and increasing levels of mixed grazing (both positive), and a combination of increasing plant species richness and vegetation stem density (negative). The efficiency of the model was examined using data from 13 sites which were sampled in the subsequent year to assess the effects of no changes and changes in land-use on the proportions of the two species. Only two sites were considered inaccurate (more than 20% different from the model), suggesting a relatively high level of accuracy. Interaction between the two species was tested for and not found to explain the differences in proportion observed. Comparisons with other studies were carried out, showing similar trends in proportions and in some of the variables identified as important. The influence of specific variables on each species is described in light of possible allometric-type effects, and the importance of these species for conservation and pest control in agriculture is discussed.

        "Absrtact": "Agroforestry is a young science in need of theories and methods providing predictive understanding. The present study is an attempt to contribute to the development of a general agroforestry theory and accessory methods. A tree-environment-crop interaction equation is derived in which the overall tree effect on crop production is explained as a balance of (positive and negative) relative net tree effects on resource availability to the crop. In this balance, each relative net tree effect receives a weight that is equal to the degree of limitation of the resource in the specific environment. The equation thus makes explicit that the balance of available resources in the environment is a major factor determining the biophysical outcome of an agroforestry technology. The equation enables the formulation of two rules that can be viewed as the agroforestry counterparts of classic crop production laws. The agroforestry counterpart of the law of limiting factors states: the more a resource becomes available in the tree-crop environment, the smaller its share becomes in the overall tree-environment-crop interaction. The agroforestry counterpart of the law of the optimum states: the more other limiting resources become available in the tree-crop environment, the greater the share of a resource becomes in the overall tree-environment-crop interaction. These rules help with extrapolation, without requiring full quantification of the tree effect balance. They allow the development of a method for the analysis and synthesis of agroforestry experiments. The method is illustrated by analysing some published alley cropping experiments. This analysis indicates that for alley cropping systems: (1) the hypothesis that trees capture nutrients below the crop rooted zone resulting in a net benefit for the crop is probably true for nitrogen and not true for phosphorus, and that (2) competition for water by trees probably exceeds their water conservation effects. Suggestions for experimentation are given and the circumstances under which yield benefits of agroforestry systems can be expected are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Marine notches are groove-like features formed in rocky coastal outcrops in relation to past sea levels, and are widely used as indicators of rates and patterns of tectonic activity. Examination of uplifted notches in the complex plate boundary setting of northeast Sicily reveals the need for considerable care in their interpretation. Present notch-forming processes are dominated by carbonate dissolution, aided by microbial activity, as waves surge and recede at the base of the cliffs, and produce notches approximately 0.5 m above present biological mean sea level (i.e. above an organic constructional rim of coralline algae, used to define sea level). At sea level, dissolution is restricted through saturation and the bedrock protected by the outbuilding algal rim. This assemblage varies in response to fetch exposure and uplift rate, typically producing a complex band of uplifted notch features exposed above sea level. Correlations (based on height) of the shallow and discontinuous notch indentations within this band are unreliable. However, the upper margin of the band, marked by the roof of the uppermost notch, is a prominent and laterally persistent feature easily recognised as the boundary between subaerial and marine processes. We propose that this is an approximately coeval datum formed when post glacial sea-level rise decelerated in the mid Holocene to match the rate of tectonic uplift, a notion strengthened by the available dates of about 5 ka for this feature. Subsequent uplift outpaced later sea-level rise, taking the notches above sea level. This proposed datum varies in height from about 2 m at Capo Milazzo (on the north coast) to about 5 m on the east coast bordered by the Messina fault system. The height differential is consistent with the respective elevations of nearby marine terraces dating from the last interglacial at about 125 ka, but also exhibits shorter term variations suggesting Holocene increases in activity rates on more localised structures affecting the localities involved. Regionally, northeast Sicily is characterised by long term differential uplift rather than behaving as a coherent block. The highest uplift rate, probably exceeding 2 mm a-1 (calculated using the sea-level curve from Fairbanks, R.G., 1989. A 17000-year glacio-eustatic sea level record; influence of glacial melting rates on the Younger Dryas event and deep-ocean circulation. Nature 342, 637-642), is suggested for a notch locality on the upthrown side of the Malta Escarpment. Rates of about 2 mm a-1 are indicated by the 5 m notch at localities bordered by the Messina fault system, and a rate close to 1 mm a-1 is suggested for the (undated) 2 m notch at Capo Milazzo. \u0169 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A number of recent clinical and molecular observations in major psychosis indicate that epigenetic factors may be operational in the origin of major mental illness. This article further develops the idea that epigenetic factors may play an etiopathogenic role in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. The putative role of epigenetic factors is shown by the epigenetic interpretation of genetic association studies of the genes for serotonin 2A (HTR2A) and the dopamine D3 (DRD3) receptors in schizophrenia. The idea of epigenetic polymorphism of genetic alleles is introduced, and it is argued that epigenetic variation may explain a number of controversial and unclear findings in allelic and genotypic association studies of HTR2A and DRD3. In linkage analyses of multiplex families with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD), different loci on chromosome 18 indicated co-segregation of alleles of one parental sex with the disease phenotype, and this finding implies that the epigenetic mechanism of genomic imprinting may be involved. Evidence for genomic imprinting provides the background for epigenetic cloning of BPAD risk factors by searching for differentially modified genes on chromosome 18. Finally, epigenetic studies could be relevant to the better understanding of the molecular action of antipsychotic medications. In addition to this, if epimutations are detected in major psychosis, epigenetic treatment directed at correction of epigenetic status of a specific brain gene may eventually be developed.

        "Absrtact": "This paper highlights the need to reduce the dimension of the feature space in classification problems of high dimensions without sacrificing the classification power considerably. We propose a methodology for classification tasks which comprises three phases: (i) feature selection, (ii) automatic generation of fuzzy if-then rules and (iii) reduction of the rule base while retaining its high classification power. The first phase is executed by using FeatureSelector, a software developed solely for feature extraction in pattern recognition and classification problems. This is for the first time that the FeatureSelector is used as a preprocessor for rule based classification systems. In the second phase, a standard fuzzy rule based classification system is modified and invoked with the most important features extracted by the FeatureSelector as the new set of features. In the third phase, a modified threshold accepting algorithm (MTA), proposed elsewhere by the authors (Ravi et al., Fuzzy Sets and Systems, forthcoming) is used for minimizing the number of rules in the classification system while guaranteeing high classification power. The number of rules used and the classification power are taken as the objectives for this multi objective combinatorial global optimization problem. The methodology proposed here has been successfully demonstrated for two well-known problems (i) the wine classification problem, which includes 13 feature variables in its original form and (ii) the Wisconsin breast cancer determination problem, which has 9 feature variables. In conclusion, the results are encouraging as there is no remarkable reduction in the classification power in both the problems, despite the fact that some features have been deleted from the study by resorting to feature selection. Also, the MTA outperformed the original threshold accepting algorithm for the test problems considered here. The authors suggest that classification problems having higher feature dimensions can be solved successfully within the framework of the methodology presented here. The high classification powers obtained for both the problems when working with less feature variables than the original number is the significant achievement of this study.",

        "Absrtact": "Despite the critical ecological roles of structural complexity, ecologically relevant quantitative measures of structural complexity that allow comparisons among forest stands are still lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a method that allows comparisons of structural heterogeneity among stands. To encompass a broad range of potential structural complexities, we simulated three spatial point patterns each for tree-size distributions from five inventoried natural stands. Forest structure was modeled and analyzed by simulating point patterns of trees and constructing triangular networks to connect neighboring tree tops to one another. This method is based on the concept of spatial tessellation of tree positions, where point patterns are converted into 2-dimensional nearest neighbor triangles. A structural complexity index (SCI) was defined as the sum of the areas of 3-dimensional triangles (with x, y, and z coordinates) divided by the sum of the areas of 2-dimensional triangles. Vertical gradients were defined as the maximum size difference among the trees forming a triangle, that is, the greater the difference, the greater the structure and the larger the SCI value. Patch-types were defined as classes of structural gradients at different positions within the canopy. More patch-types are also indicative of more structurally heterogeneous stands. Both the SCI and the number of patch-types and patch-size heterogeneity related closely to conventional descriptors of forest structure. While the number of patch-types and patch-type heterogeneity related more to the vertical component of structural complexity, SCI integrated well with both the vertical and horizontal structure. SCI and the concept of patch-types complement one another and can be used to quantitatively compare the structure of different stands. The applicability of this modeling approach in characterizing the structural heterogeneity of forests across spatial scales is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The issue of particle size is more difficult to address due to the scarcity of data.

Evidence of Puumala infection was restricted to Clethrionomys glareolus. Although the serotype was not determined, antibodies against hantavirus were also found in eight Apodemus sylvaticus. In fall 1996, the seroprevalence in C. glareolus was high (20.1%, 37 of 184) and the infection was widely distributed in the area studied whereas a focal occurrence of positive rodents and lower seroprevalence rates were recorded in spring 1997 (14.3%, six of 42), fall 1997 (6.6%, 11 of 166), spring 1998 (6.4%, three of 47) and fall 1998 (6.7%, 11 of 165). A pullulation of rodents was observed in spring 1999 and was associated with a markedly higher seroprevalence in C. glareolus (47.7%, 189 of 396). In all seasons, infection rates in adults were higher than in juveniles and subadults. No significant difference of prevalence was recorded between males and females. In two trapping sites, the temporary disappearance of positive animals after a crash in rodent populations suggests that a threshold in density is necessary for the maintenance of the enzootic cycle.

        "Absrtact": "When an accidental release of a hazardous material is considered within a safety case or risk assessment, its off-site effects are generally assessed by calculating the dispersion of vapour from the site. Although most installations handling flammable materials will be in the open air, many types of plant, particularly those handling toxics, are enclosed, partly to provide some form of containment and hence, to mitigate the effects of any release. When such a release occurs within a building, the gas or vapour will undergo some mixing before emerging from any opening. The degree of mixing will depend upon the building geometry and the nature of the ventilation, which in turn may be modified by the leak. This situation is considered in this paper, with specific application to calculating the rate of release of a dense vapour from a building. The paper describes the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to modelling the release and mixing processes within buildings. Examples of validation calculations for simple geometric arrangements, as well as more complex geometries representative of an industrial site, are described. The results demonstrate the capabilities of CFD for this application but highlight the need for careful modelling of the near-wall flows and heat transfer, and need for an accurate fluid dynamics and thermodynamic representation of the release source.

Os isotope ratios are low (187Os/188Os((i)) = 0.1272-0.1371) in terms of global plume related magmatism, and this is coupled with anomalously high Os abundances and radiogenic 143Nd/144Nd((i)) isotopes. Crustally contaminated basalts within the West Greenland sequences possess Os and Nd isotopic signatures consistent with mixing between initial plume head compositions and two discrete types of West Greenland continental crust. One crustal component is of a local sedimentary origin, and the other is typical of ancient felsic crust. The low Os isotopic signatures of the picritic units are considered to be those of the initial mantle plume. The fact that such low Os isotope ratios occur in sequences with high 3He/4He, and the non-systematic variation in Os isotopes with indices of fractionation/accumulation and Pb isotopes, argue against mixing with depleted MORB mantle or ancient subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The high Os concentrations in the picrites are attributed to high degrees of partial melting (>25%) of mantle containing no residual sulphide. This is consistent with models for plume heads in which anomalous mantle temperatures initiate melting at high pressures generating large degrees of partial melting. Unradiogenic Os and radiogenic Nd components in plume-related CFB magmatism may preserve contributions from a reservoir which is sampled only occasionally in young oceanic basalts. Such a reservoir shares Os isotopic features with the primitive upper mantle (PUM), which may also be manifest in the 'Kea' component of Hawaiian magmatism. Therefore, portions of the West Greenland continental flood basalt province arguably represent the first direct sampling of unmodified plume head material derived from the lower mantle or lower portions of the upper mantle.

Eleven adult CF patients were studied in a protocol that allowed comparisons within individual subjects: vector and placebo were sprayed into alternate nostrils at intervals over 7 h. After dosing, vector-specific DNA was present in nasal lavage of all subjects for up to 10 days. There were no adverse events.

CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance increased toward normal during repetitive nasal potential difference measurements over the 3 days before dosing which influenced the postdosing calculations.

This paper focuses principally on the biological record and describes recent research that aims to reconstruct (i) past variability in effective moisture, and (ii) past variability in temperature. Changes in effective moisture are manifested especially by changes in lake water level. In closed lake basins water level change can cause significant changes in water salinity that is registered in sediments by changes in the composition of fossil assemblages, especially diatoms. In open (freshwater) lake basins changes in water level are best reconstructed from the aquatic macrofossil record and potentially from the ratio of open water to littoral species of Cladocera, ostracods and diatoms. The most promising biological method for reconstructing past temperature is chironomid analysis, and a range of new chironomid-temperature transfer functions are being developed. However, biological responses to changing temperature are usually indirect as a result of temperature effects on water-column stratification, nutrient cycling and alkalinity generation, and in most cases a correct interpretation of the climatic significance of changes in the fossil record requires an understanding of the processes that are operating in the water column. A multi-proxy, whole-lake approach is advocated as the best way forward, not only as a means of reconstructing past climate but also as a means of assessing the impact of climate change on lake systems.",

        "Absrtact": "Selenium deficiency (Keshan Disease) and toxicity diseases in humans occur within 20 km of each other in Enshi District in China and have been linked to environmental levels of Se. Low concentrations of Se are associated with Jurassic siltstones and sandstones, whereas high concentrations occur in areas underlain by Permian carbonaceous strata. Although these broad relationships between Se in the environment and the human population have been established previously, not all villages underlain by the carbonaceous strata suffer Se toxicity problems and the precise controls on Se distribution and availability have not been quantified. In the present study, soil, grain, drinking water and human hair samples are examined to determine the controls on Se availability in 3 se environments in Enshi District. Five low-Se and Keshan Disease villages, 5 high-Se and no toxicity villages and 5 high-Se and toxicity villages were selected for the study. Results show that the majority of samples in the low-Se villages are deficient or marginal in Se, and that Se availability to plants is inhibited by adsorption onto organic matter and Fe oxyhydroxides in soil. Therefore, remediation strategies involving the application of Se fertiliser direct to the soil may not increase plant Se levels as expected. In the high-Se villages, localised lithological variations result in considerable ranges in Se concentrations in all sample types. Deficient and excessive levels of Se are recorded in samples from the same village. Selenium bioavailability in the high-Se toxicity villages is controlled by the total soil Se concentration and pH. A greater proportion of the Se is plant available in villages where the carbonaceous strata are interbedded with limestone. Villagers should be advised to avoid plating crops in these areas if possible.",

        "Absrtact": "The Jalama pluton (JP) is one of the best examples of the late Hercynian two-mica granites of the Central-Iberian Zone (CIZ) of the Hesperian Massif (Spain and Portugal). This pluton is a multiphase intrusion that consists of three intrusive units: (1) the external unit (EU) comprises three main facies [a two-mica coarse-grained porphyritic granite (PG), a two-mica coarse-grained equigranular granite (EG) and a tourmaline-bearing-muscovite leucogranite (TL)] which define both vertical and horizontal zonation. The main petrographic and compositional characteristics of the EU can be explained by a fractional crystallization process that takes place in independent magma batches generated from heterogeneous source rocks; (2) the sillimanite monzogranite (SM) is distinguished by the presence of micaceous aggregates composed of biotite, muscovite and sillimanite. Based on major and trace element data the compositional variability within the SM has been ascribed to inheritance from compositionally heterogeneous source rocks; (3) the late leucogranites (LL) appear mainly as dykes intruded in the PG. From a comparison with this PG, it can be deduced that the LL represent derivative liquids segregated after important fractionation from magmas equivalent to PG magmas but at deeper levels. The most important implication of our study is that the Jalama granites were generated by partial melting of high-grade metamorphic peraluminous rocks that were compositionally heterogeneous on different scales. During this small-scale intracrustal melting event, temperature was the limiting factor for the degree of melting. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The greenstone belts are characterized by collages of oceanic plateaus, oceanic island arcs, and trench turbidites; these lithotectonic fragments were tectonically assembled in a large subduction-accretion complex. Following juxtaposition, these diverse lithologies were collectively intruded by synkinematic TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite) plutons and ultramafic to felsic dykes and sills, with subduction zone geochemical signatures. Intra-oceanic basalts are characterized by near-flat REE patterns, and Nb/U and Nb/Th ratios generally greater than primitive mantle values, consistent with positive \u03b5(Nd) values. They are associated with komatiites, the association being interpreted as an ocean plateau sequence erupted from a mantle plume. Bimodal arc volcanic sequences, trench turbidites, and contemporaneous TTG suites are characterized by fractionated REE, with Nb/U and Nb/Th ratios less than primitive mantle values. Mixing hyperbolae between oceanic plateau and magmatic arc sequences pass through the estimated composition of bulk continental crust, suggesting that crustal growth in the late Archean was by tectonic, sedimentary, and chemical mixing of oceanic plateau and arc sequences at convergent plate boundaries. Mixing calculations suggest that oceanic plateau and subduction zone components in the Wawa continental crust are represented by 6-12% and 88-94%, respectively. High Nb/U and Nb/Th ratios of plateau tholeiitic basalts are interpreted as a complementary reservoir to arc magmatism (low Nb/U and Nb/Th), hundreds of millions of years prior to recycling of oceanic lithosphere through a subduction zone (high Nb/U, Nb/Th), and its incorporation into a mantle plume from which 2.7 Ga plateau tholeiites erupted. The variably high Nb/U ratios of the plateau basalts are consistent with early extraction of large quantities of the protoliths (magmatic precursor) of continental crust from the southern Superior Province asthenospheric mantle.

        "Absrtact": "Use of microscopic algae as sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids for incorporation as feed additive in aquaculture has received increasing interest owing to beneficial effects upon growth rates of zooplankton. However, the biochemical composition of marine algae is a function of the composition of the culture medium. Pavlova lutheri is particularly interesting because it is able to modulate the fatty acid profile of its lipidic fraction when cultured with various nutrient media. Three enriched seawater media (i.e. GPM, f/2 and MN) and one synthetic medium (i.e. ASW), covering considerable quantitative and qualitative ranges of nutrients, were tested in order to determine the medium compositions that stimulate production of such polyunsaturated fatty acids as EPA and DHA, and the biochemical compositions of the algae grown in each were monitored accordingly. Relationships between the mineral components of the medium and the resulting biomass yield, as well as the biochemical profile and the polyunsaturated fatty acid productivity, are tentatively presented in attempts to shed further light on the effects of the processing environment upon microalgae. Statistical analyses of the experimental results have indicated that GPM provides the best compromise in terms of cell yield (12.1 \u00d7 106 cell mr-1) and polyunsaturated fatty acid productivities (0.502 mg 1-1 d-1 and 0.228 mg 1-1 d-1 in EPA and DHA, respectively). In addition, GPM is a simple medium, mainly composed of seawater, nitrogen and phosphorus, thus having a low production cost and being easy to prepare in industrial settings, so it is suitable for general use in aquaculture of marine species. \u00a9 2000 Adac/\u00c9ditions scientifiques et m\u00e9dicales Elsevier SAS.",

This paper provides an overview of the concepts, issues and challenges that planners and policy makers face in designing natural resource monitoring systems and using their outcomes in the formulation of policies and intervention programs. It begins with a discussion of a new conceptual framwork for monitoring based on resource management domains (RMDs), which defines monitoring units based on resource problems and potential policy interventions. This followed by a description of steps necessary for effectively implementing a monitoring system and possible flows and use of information in decision-making. Finally, the paper identifies issues relevant to the design of natural resource monitoring systems, and future challenges facing governments, academic institutions, and donor agencies. The paper concludes that a monitoring system which is simple, user-driven, based on existing institutional structures, and has the commitment of decision makers for using the information in policy design and program development is more likely to be successful.

Approximately one-third of participating mothers were HIV-infected. Results indicated that HIV-infected women and their children endorsed receiving lower levels of socioemotional support than noninfected women and their children. More social and emotional support from neighbors and friends was associated with less psychological distress of both HIV- infected and noninfected women. More socioemotional support from the mother was associated with less depressive mood and disruptive behavior among all children. Some evidence indicated that higher levels of emotional support received by mothers from children were associated with greater psychological distress in mothers. With few exceptions, the HIV status of the mother did not qualify the relationship between socioemotional support and psychosocial adjustment. Thus, socioemotional support appeared to serve as a resource factor, rather than a protective factor, among these families.

The model is forced monthly by ship winds and climatologies of heat and fresh water fluxes. The comparison between the model run both with and without assimilation is first analyzed in terms of empirical orthogonal functions, and along particular sections in the basin. The results are then compared with independent hydrological measurements obtained during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment cruise CITHER 1, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean in early 1993. The comparison is improved globally with assimilation. The largest impact of the assimilation appears in the North Equatorial Counter Current and the North Equatorial Current (5\u00b0N-15\u00b0N). Sub-surface thermocline motions were not reproduced by the model alone, but, are clearly depicted in the assimilation results along 7\u00b030'N and are in good agreement with the CITHER 1 data. Considerations about the assimilation technique, the model and the forcing data sets are also discussed via this independent validation. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Results from a detailed analysis of the French macroseismic database SIRENE96 show that geomechanical site effects (i.e. site effects due to superficial geology) can be statistically detected and quantified from macroseismic data. Our results are used to derive a predictive map of potential site effects in France and to check if site effects induce a significant overestimation of macroseismic magnitude of historical events. The key hypothesis of our work is that geological formations of similar age produce similar site effects because one expects the younger sediments to be less compacted, and therefore more prone to cause site effects. A geological formation is associated with each intensity using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the digital geological map of France. Two approaches are developed in order to characterise the intensity increase associated with geological formations having the same age. The first approach is based on the intensities that differ significantly from the average pattern, intensities which are labelled as anomalies. In the second approach, a theoretical intensity attenuation law is computed for each selected event only from observations located on formations older than 2 My. According to the results of the first approach, these formations are unlikely to cause site effects, and for the sake of simplicity they are labelled as rocks (younger formations are defined as sediments). The derived attenuation laws are then used to compute the residuals for each observation. Residuals are classified as a function of the age of the formations on which they are located. The results of the two approaches are in good agreement. No intensity amplification is detected for formations older than 1 My. For younger formations, the younger the formations, the larger the average intensity increase. The average intensity increase reaches 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 degree on the MSK scale for 0 My sediments. The results are better expressed in terms of probability: For 0 My sediments, there is an estimated 83% probability of observing an intensity increase; for 0.01 My and 0.75 My sediments, this probability is about 52%. The magnitude of the intensity increase is variable, but it is generally small: It has a 26% probability to reach 1 degree or above on the MSK scale for 0 My sediments and this probability falls to about 5% for 0.01 and 0.75 My formations. A predictive map of geomechanical site effects is produced by extrapolating the characteristics of intensity increases to all geologic formations of similar age in France. Glacial and fluvial valleys, already known as being subject to site effects, clearly appear on this map, as well as less expected areas such as the South Atlantic coast. Lastly, new estimations of macroseismic magnitude that exclude intensities potentially affected by geomechanical site effects are realised. A magnitude overestimation due to site effects can possibly exist, but it remains limited (<0.2). This result tends to demonstrate that geomechanical site effects in France do not significantly distort our knowledge of historical seismicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "An intensive series of observations off the Holderness coast was followed by a related set of modelling applications. Observations included: aircraft and satellite remote sensing, H.F. and X-band radar, ship surveys and in situ instruments on the sea bed and at the sea surface. These observations aimed to monitor, over three successive winter periods, the dynamics and sediment distributions in the vicinity of this rapidly eroding coastline. Associated modelling applications included components simulating: (i) tides and surge currents; (ii) wave evolution; (iii) vertical distributions of turbulence and SPM (suspended particulate matter) and (iv) resulting spatial patterns of sediment transport in the region. Simulations of tidal currents confirmed the accuracy of such models, given accurate fine-resolution bathymetry and appropriate boundary conditions. New developments of WAM, the spectral wave model required for fine-resolution applications in shallow water (described by Monbaliu et al. [Monbaliu, J., Padilla-Hernandez, R., Hargreaves, J.C., Carretero Albiach, J.C., Luo, W., Sclavo, M., Gunther, H., 2000. The spectral wave model WAM adapted for applications with high spatial resolution. This volume.]) are tested here. A number of additional features pertaining to shallow water are revealed including the sensitivity to specification of wind directions and the excessive temporal spreading of short-lived distant events. Likewise, the application of the generic single-point models for vertical profiles of turbulence and SPM (described by Baumert et al. [Baumert, H., Chapalain, G., Smaoui, H., McManus, J.P., Yagi, H., Regener, M., Sundermann, J., Szilagy, B., 2000. Modelling and numerical simulation of turbulence, waves and suspended sediment for pre-operational use in coastal seas. This volume]), are tested and also shown to be appropriate for simulating localised resuspension of SPM. This simulation also illustrates how, in shallow water (< 15 m), tidal and wave dynamics interact with significant mutual adjustments and with first-order influence on stress at the sea bed and thereby erosion and suspension processes. Some preliminary simulations of net sediment movement are included, involving an integration of the above effects. These simulations emphasise how, in all but the shallowest water, the mobility of coarse grain sediments is limited to occasions of extreme waves. By contrast, the movement of fine sediments follows that of the residual tidal current streamlines, i.e., primarily longshore with attendant cross-shore dispersion. However, significant variation between closely-spaced observations indicates the irregularity and complexity of such distributions. It is concluded that because of the inability to prescribe the spatial distribution of available surficial sediments (including size distributions) such simulations can only be expected to reproduce the essential statistical characteristics of SPM concentrations. The availability of extensive remote sensing or in situ data can help to circumvent this problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.A study was carried out to quantify contemporary fluxes from a rapidly eroding coast to the adjacent sea and relate these fluxes to separate causative mechanisms via model simulations. For this study, the Holderness coast was chosen. The essential characteristics of the tidal and wave dynamics including their interactions were determined. These components were then incorporated into a single-point model of turbulence intensity and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations. Finally, a preliminary two-dimensional (2D) model of SPM transport off Holderness was established.",

        "Absrtact": "The fluorescence emission of yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) has been shown to respond rapidly and reversibly to changes in the concentration of some small anions such as halides; this allows for the use of YFPs as genetically encodable Cl- sensors that may be targeted to specific organelles in living cells. Fluorescence is suppressed due to protonation of the chromophore upon anion binding, with a stronger level of interaction at low pH values. At pH 6.0, the apparent dissociation constant (K(app)) for Cl- is 32 mM for YFP and 22 mM for YFP-H148Q, whereas at pH 7.5, K(app) is 777 mM and 154 mM, respectively. In the cytosol, YFP-H148Q appears most promising as a halide sensor due to its high degree of sensitivity towards I- (K(app) = 23 mM at pH 7.5). To aid in the design of variants with improved levels of specificity and affinity for Cl-, we solved apo and I--bound crystal structures of YFP-H148Q to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution. The halide-binding site is found near van der Waals contact with the chromophore imidazolinone oxygen atom, in a small buried cavity adjacent to Arg96, which provides electrostatic stabilization. The halide ion is hydrogen bonded to the phenol group of T203Y, consistent with a mutational analysis that indicates that T203Y is indispensible for tight binding. A series of conformational changes occurs in the amphiphilic site upon anion binding, which appear to be propagated to the \u03b2-bulge region around residue 148 on the protein surface. Anion binding raises the chromophore pK(a) values, since delocalization of the phenolate negative charge over the chromophore skeleton is suppressed. Extraction of microscopic binding constants for the linked equilibrium between anion and proton binding indicates that anion selectivity by YFP is related to hydration forces. Specific suggestions to improve Cl- binding to YFP-H148Q based on size and hydration energy are proposed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

Although the voluntary wait period was increased by 100 days (50 vs. 150), the predicted difference in simulated days to conception was only 89 days for the extended voluntary wait-period group (which we attributed to higher fertility later in lactation). Herds that had a voluntary wait period of 150 days (compared to the control herds' voluntary wait period of 50 days) were predicted to have significantly lower rates of metabolic and reproductive disorders and clinical mastitis on both cow-year and milk-yield bases. Simulated control herds, on average, produced 8539 kg of milk in an average lactation of 325 days and simulated herds with a 150-day voluntary wait period 10 893 kg of milk in an average lactation of 409 days. There was a significantly lower predicted rate and risk of culling for reproductive failure in the extended voluntary wait period group. The predicted lactational incidence risks for subclinical IMI were 18% higher for the extended voluntary wait period group - but extending the voluntary wait period by 100 days was predicted not to increase the risk of any of the other 10 disorders.

The growth rates calculated with this model were consistent with the published ones but the fit was poor near the limits of growth of the micro-organism. The model was also less accurate to describe the lag time. It seems then that reliable predictions of the growth rate of L. monocytogenes could be obtained in a wide range of growth conditions, but models should take into account interactions between environmental factors. Furthermore, it is necessary to better model the lag phase duration and particularly to model the effect of the history of the inoculum on the subsequent lag time.

        "Absrtact": "The superb quality of the climate chronology archived in the Summit, Greenland ice cores (GRIP, GISP2) testifies that the Greenland Ice Sheet divide has been generally stable through the last glacial cycle. The ice sheet has experienced a broad range of paleoclimate conditions, ice sheet margin configurations, and internal dynamical adjustments in glacial-interglacial transitions, however. It is unlikely that the Summit region escaped shifts in ice divide position, geometry, elevation, and flow characteristics. Details of this dynamical history are important to several aspects of ice core studies. The magnitudes of pure and simple shearing, reconstruction of vertical ice velocity, the explicit location of the ice divide, and the divide 'residence time' at different locations are all of interest in interpretation of climatic variables and physical properties of ice in the ice cores. We apply a three-dimensional, thermomechanical ice sheet model to examine the evolution of these dynamical variables over the last 160 kyr in central Greenland. While a high-elevation ice dome is present in the Summit region throughout the simulation, ice divide migrations of up to 150 km are predicted. All points in the vicinity of the Summit ice cores, including the modern divide, have been subject to flowline shifts and variable, non-zero shear deformation during the adjustment from glacial to Holocene conditions, from ca. 10 ka to the present. Modelled divide pereginations and strain rate history are consistent with the observed disturbance of deep ice in the GRIP and GISP2 ice cores, which has muddled paleoclimate reconstructions for the last interglacial (Eemian) period in Greenland. Dynamical excursions are also evident north of the modern summit, where the NGRIP ice core is currently being drilled [Dahl-Jensen et al., J. Glaciol. 43 (1997) 300-306]. However, the prevailing flow direction and deformation regime at the NGRIP site are much more stable than those at GRIP and GISP2 in the simulations. Combined with the greater depth of ice at this site, this lends cautious optimism to the hope that Eemian ice at NGRIP may contain an intact record of Eemian climate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Consistent MMT was more likely among women, Whites and older subjects. Monthly total expenditures and inpatient expenditures were significantly lower for IDUs in MMT than for IDUs with claims indicative of current drug abuse. Consistent participation in MMT was associated with a higher probability of antiretroviral use and, among antiretroviral users, more consistent use of antiretrovirals. Merged administrative data sets can be an important data source that illuminate the relationships among drug abuse, drug treatment, and HIV-related health care. For AIDS-infected IDUs, consistent MMT may lower barriers to receipt of appropriate HIV-related health care and reinforce adherence to medical recommendations.

The investigation concentrated on the second half of the temperate stage (locally called the La Cote Interglacial Stage). Palaeoecological, palaeoenvironmental and quantitative climatic reconstructions for the termination of the interglacial period and the onset of cold conditions are presented. Because the different fossils were affected in varying ways by taphonomic processes they provide a range of complementary data about the palaeoenvironment, and illustrate the importance of multi-disciplinary studies. As conditions became cooler at the end of the temperate stage the lake levels fluctuated, and the water's trophic status changed. The occurrence of Pterocarya and the dominance of Abies support a correlation with the temperate Holsteinian Stage (oxygen isotope stage 11). At the top of the core an interstadial event characterised by Pinus, Picea and Betula is represented. This could have occurred either directly after the La Cote Interglacial Stage or the event may have occurred during the following cold La Bourne Stage after a hiatus. The climate fluctuations represented at the end of the La Cote Interglacial Stage in the Val-de-Lans basin prompt comparisons with the end of the Eemian Stage (Late Pleistocene) and suggest that such oscillations are characteristic for the end of temperate stages. An understanding of the changes represented here aids the evaluation of present trends as we possibly enter the final phases of the Holocene Stage. Sites of this age and located at this altitude are rare in Europe; therefore, it is proposed that the La Cote site should be considered as a high altitude, alpine parastratotype for the Holsteinian Stage in western Europe.

In order to study and compare forest dynamics in disturbed and undisturbed stands, contrasted silvicultural treatments were performed between 1986 and 1988 in these plots. Taking advantage of this experimental design and of this large database, a forest dynamics modelling project was started in 1992. This paper aims at presenting the growth component of the single-tree, distance-dependent model that was developed within the framework of this project. This individual diameter growth model was built according to the 'potential x modifier' paradigm: it links tree annual diameter increment to variables describing tree size and instantaneous competition as well as the recent past evolution of the competition. Species information was also taken into account and resulted: (i) in the classification of tree species into 15 functional groups that are homogeneous for diameter growth; and (ii) in a definite improvement of model efficiency. Attempts to further reduce the residual variance through the use of soil and topographical information remained unsuccessful. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "This article deals with the waste management of post-consumer plastics in Germany and its potential to save fossil fuels and reduce CO2 emissions. Since most of the experience available is for packaging the paper first gives an outline of the legislative background and the material flows for this sector. The recycling and recovery processes for plastics waste from all sectors are then assessed in terms of their potential contribution to energy saving and CO2 abatement. Practically all the options studied show better performance regarding these two aspects than waste treatment in an average incinerator (which has been chosen as the reference case). High ecological benefits can be achieved by mechanical recycling if virgin polymers are substituted. The cost effectiveness of reducing energy use and CO2 emissions is determined for a number of technologies. There is large scope to reduce the costs, with an estimated overall saving potential of 50% within one to two decades. The paper then presents scenario projections which are based on the assumption that the total plastics waste in Germany in 1995 is treated in processes which will be available by 2005; considerable savings can be made by moving away from the business-as-usual path to highly efficient waste incinerators (advanced waste-to-energy facilities). Under these conditions the distribution of plastics waste among mechanical recycling and feedstock recycling has a comparatively small impact on the overall results. The maximum savings amount to 74 PJ of energy, i.e. 9% of the chemical sector's energy demand in 1995 and 7.0 Mt CO2, representing 13% of the sector's emissions and 0.8% of Germany's total CO2 emissions. This shows that plastics waste management offers some scope for reducing environmental burdens. The assessment does not support a general recommendation of energy recovery, mainly due to the large difference between the German average and the best available waste-to-energy facilities.

        "Absrtact": "The Hong'an region in the Qinling-Dabie collisional zone in eastern China hosts a series of metamorphic rocks exposing a south-to-north distribution from blueschist/blueschist-greenschist, amphibolite, eclogite (kyanite free) and kyanite-eclogite to coesite-eclogite facies rocks that represent progressively deeper levels of the Mesozoic subduction-collision complex. The Hong'an area is interesting for three reasons: (1) it escaped the thermal and structural overprint imparted on much of the Dabie Mountains during Early Cretaceous intrusion of voluminous granites and granodiorites; (2) the high-pressure (HP) Hong'an eclogites are widely distributed, often preserve prograde crystallization histories and can be directly linked in time and space to the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist rocks exposed to the south; (3) the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist facies rocks are generally better exposed than their equivalents in the southeastern Dabie Mountains and offer some opportunity for simultaneous structural and metamorphic analysis. The Hong'an area HP rocks offer perhaps the closest approximation to a preserved snapshot of Mesozoic pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions attending early subduction-exhumation in the region, and are thus essential to generating a coherent picture of the dynamics attending both metamorphism and exposure of the coeval ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks. The purpose of this contribution is twofold: (1) to document previously unpublished metamorphic and structural data characterizing these HP sequences and their relative continuity in Hong'an; (2) to incorporate these data with recent geochronologic, structural and paleomagnetic information in the context of protracted, late Paleozoic through Mesozoic subduction, collision and exhumation. Metamorphism and exhumation of some of the southern Hong'an HP sequences appear to have occurred concomitant with oceanic subduction immediately to the west, and thus may have preceded widespread continental subduction/collision. Moreover, all of the HP-UHP sequences in the region were exhumed before the end of collision between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons at ca. 160 Ma. Exhumation of HP-UHP rocks both before and during continental plate collision is neither novel for central China nor for other HP-UHP zones, but is important to take into account when reconstructing the evolution of such orogens.

        "Absrtact": "A new glacial chronology for equatorial East Africa is developed using in situ cosmogenic 36 Cl measured in 122 boulders from moraines on Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro. The oldest deposits sampled on Kilimanjaro yield a limiting 36 Cl age of > 360 calendar kyr (all 36 Cl ages are in calendar years, cal. kyr or cal. yr). On Mount Kenya, the oldest moraines give ages of 355-420 kyr (Liki I) and 255-285 kyr (Teleki). Given the uncertainty in our 36 Cl ages, the Liki I moraine may correspond to either marine isotope stage 10 or 12, whereas the Teleki moraine correlates with stage 8. There is no evidence for stage 6 on either mountain. The Liki II moraines on Mt. Kenya and moraines of the Fourth Glaciation on Kilimanjaro give ages of 28 \u00b1 3 kyr and 20 \u00b1 1 kyr, respectively. They represent the last glacial maximum (LGM) and correlate with stage 2 of the marine isotope record. A series of smaller moraines above the LGM deposits record several readvances that occurred during the late glacial. On Mt. Kenya, these deposits date to 14.6 \u00b1 1.2 kyr (Liki IIA), 10.2 \u00b1 0.5 kyr (Liki III), 8.6 \u00b1 0.2 kyr (Liki IIIA) and ~ 200 yr (Lewis); the corresponding deposits on Kilimanjaro have mean ages of 17.3 \u00b1 2.9 kyr (Fourth Glaciation-Saddle), 15.8 \u00b1 2.5 kyr (Little Glaciation-Saddle), and 13.8 \u00b1 2.3 kyr (Fourth Glaciation-Kibo). These data indicate that the climate of the tropics was extremely variable at the end of the last glacial cycle. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The third fibronectin type III domain of human tenascin folds and unfolds in a two-state fashion over a range of temperature and pH values, and in the presence of stabilising salts. Here, we present a high resolution protein engineering analysis of the single rate determining transition state. The 48 mutations report on the contribution of side-chains at 32 sites in the core and loop regions. Three areas in the protein exhibit high \u03a6-values, indicating that they are partially structured in the transition state. First, a common-core ring of four positions in the central strands B, C, E and F, that are in close contact, form a nucleus of tertiary interactions. The two other regions that appear well-formed are the C' region and the E-F loop. The \u03a6-values gradually decrease away from these regions such that the very ends of the two terminal strands A and G, have \u03a6-values of zero. We propose a model for the folding of immunoglobulin-like proteins in which the common-core 'ring' forms the nucleus for folding, whilst the C' and E-F regions are constrained by topology to pack early. Folding characteristics of a group of structurally related proteins appear to support this model. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

We find that the loan spread depends on a bank's screening and monitoring incentives, which varies across differentially regulated classes of banks. This leads to significant price disparities in the loan market. In particular, the US branches of Japanese banks participate in syndicated lending to US firms that charge significantly higher spreads compared to syndicated loans to US firms without Japanese participation. This pricing disparity is primarily due to regulatory differences. We also find that as specialized intermediaries, banks price loans based primarily on their own monitoring. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The recently discovered Niva agpaitic syenite intrusion is located 50 km southwest of the Khibina complex, central Kola Peninsula. It forms a lense-like body 1.5-2 km in size that outcrops over an area of 300 X 200 m on the southern bank of the Imandra lake. Rb-Sr (379 \u00b1 21 Ma) and Sm-Nd (383 \u00b1 58 Ma) isochron ages of the intrusion coincide with the age of the Khibina and Lovozero complexes. A characteristic feature of the Niva rocks is their extremely high agpaicity and enrichment in Sr, Ba, Y, Zr, Nb, Rb, LREE, and volatiles. The mineral association in the agpaitic syenite is K-feldspar, aegirine-diopside, biotite, lamprophyllite, aenigmatite and shcherbakovite. Isotopic compositions indicate the absence of contamination by continental crust during formation of the Niva alkaline magmas. A depleted asthenospheric mantle reservoir mixed with a slightly enriched mantle component is suggested to be the main source of the Niva magma. A metasomatically altered garnet granulite xenolith from the western contact of the Niva intrusion contains a primary paragenesis of diopside, garnet and plagioclase with chemical characteristics similar to those in the granulite suite of the adjacent Lapland zone and lower crustal granulite xenoliths from Devonian pipes in the Kandalaksha area. Additionally, the granulite contains vinogradovite, neptunite, pectolite and natrolite which partially replace both primary minerals of the granulite assemblage and secondary minerals which were formed during a later regional metamorphism. PT estimates support the lower crustal origin of the xenolith. The U-Pb zircon age of the Niva garnet granulite is 2711 \u00b1 7 Ma. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Optimally accurate second-order time domain finite difference scheme for the elastic equation of motion: 1-D case. Geophys. J. Int. 135, 48-62]. This scheme was derived on the basis of a general criterion for optimally accurate numerical operators obtained by Geller and Takeuchi [Geller, R.J., Takeuchi, N., 1995. A new method for computing highly accurate DSM synthetic seismograms. Geophys. J. Int. 123, 449-470]. In this paper, we derive optimally accurate time-domain FDM operators for 2-D and 3-D problems following the same basic approach. A numerical example shows that synthetics for a 2-D P-SV problem computed using the modified scheme are 30 times more accurate than synthetics computed using a conventional FDM scheme, at a cost of only 3.5 times as much CPU time. This means that the CPU time required to compute synthetics of any specified accuracy using the modified scheme is only 1/47 that required to achieve the same accuracy using the conventional scheme; the memory required by the modified scheme is 1/18 that of the conventional scheme. We have not conducted computational experiments for the 3-D case, but we estimate that the CPU time advantage of the modified scheme will be a factor of over 100. The stability condition (maximum time step for a given spatial grid interval) for the various modified schemes is roughly equal to that for the corresponding conventional scheme.

        "Absrtact": "We have assessed the impact of seasonal pulses of phyto-detritus towards the bottom of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) in the NE Atlantic. Phytopigments were determined (HPLC) in sediment, near-bottom suspended matter and sediment trap samples to obtain an impression of the quantity and quality of the organic material reaching the bottom. Its supposed effect on the benthic community was estimated on the basis of in situ Sediment Community Oxygen Consumption (SCOC) rates, deck oxygen micro profiles as well as chlorophyll mixing and degradation rates. There was considerable interannual variation in the deposition of fresh organic material. In September 1996 the mass flux at 10 m above the bottom was 0.25 g DW m-2 d-1. The material caught in the trap was relatively fresh with a chlorophyll-a:phaeophorbide ratio of 1.33. During the other seasons (March 1997, July 1997 and October 1997) such fresh material was absent and even in July, the period in which fresh material is supposed to have arrived on the bottom, the ratio remained low, viz. 0.23. Based on these findings we conclude that in 1997 only small amounts of already degraded material arrived at the sea floor. On the basis of the large quantities of fresh material found in September 1996, the existence and subsequent deposition of autumn blooms should be considered. With in situ respirometry no effect of the differential quality and quantity of the settling detritus could be detected, whereas model parameters based on oxygen microprofiles demonstrated changes associated with the supposed seasonal cycle. Also the downcore pigment distribution of chlorophyll-a and derived mixing and degradation coefficients showed variations which were linked to the observed seasonal changes in input of organic matter.

        "Absrtact": "Evaporation over the Mediterranean basin produces a salty water mass that overflows the relatively narrow and shallow Strait of Gibraltar. The outflow is investigated with the three-dimensional Princeton Ocean Model. The model makes use of a bottom-following, sigma-coordinate system and an imbedded turbulence closure scheme to simulate the bottom boundary layer. Starting as a channel flow confined by the sidewalls of the trench of the westernmost part of the Strait, the bottom boundary current descends the steep continental slope of the eastern Gulf of Cadiz. The flow is controlled by a balance of the pressure gradient and the Coriolis acceleration, entrainment and bottom friction. Downslope Ekman fluxes are largest at the shelf break near the entrance of the Strait where we observe the most pronounced entrainment of North Atlantic Central Water. Profiles of modeled horizontal velocity, as well as scalar and turbulent quantities, show a remarkable resemblance to observed features. The model reproduces the 'nose' shape of the velocity profile that is typical for a density current; below the velocity maximum, there is a well-mixed layer and a stratified shear layer exists above the nose. The evolution of water mass properties along the path of the outflow agrees favorably with observations and the sensitivity of the Mediterranean outflow (MO) to varying source water properties is investigated. The combined effect of initial stratification, differential entrainment, and routing by the topography leads to the evolution of the well-known two-core structure of the bottom layer. Whereas the upper part of the outflow continues to follow the continental slope northward in the form of a bottom boundary current after it passes Cape St. Vincent, the lower core separates from the slope and there is a lateral spreading of the saline and warm outflow water in the depth range of the lower salinity maximum (centered at about 1200 m). The outflow becomes hydrodynamically unstable and lenses of saline water shed from the core, carrying their water mass characteristic into the Atlantic. The model results confirm that the area of Cape St. Vincent is a prominent formation area for Mediterranean water (MW) eddies (Meddies). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The data indicate that the braided bedform typical of British cold stage rivers evolved into a lower energy meandering form around 10 500 BP, a process that caused channel cut-off. The fill of one of these contained organic sediments and in-washed sands dating from 10 500-9300 BP in which there was palynological evidence for the replacement of Late Devensiaan tundra by early Holocene pine forest. Biostratigraphic evidence for the period 9000-5500 BP was limited owing to the absence of organic sediments and, instead, deposition was of in-channel sands. Peat formation began at c. 5500 BP, and these organic sequences contain evidence of the elm decline at 5010\u00b170 BP and the lime decline at 3070\u00b160 BP. The latter event was accompanied by forest clearance for Bronze Age agriculture and a consequent alteration to both the marsh and dry ground flora. Around 2500 BP the peats were submerged beneath estuarine muds as a result of further sea-level rise. A series of age/altitude points relating to Holocene sea-levels were constructed from the site data and were found to fit relatively well with current ideas of sea-level change in the post-glacial period. The results from Silvertown reflect data from shorter sequences in the London area, combining evidence of the Late glacial to early Holocene transition, with information on river development, changes in sea-level tendency and human-induced vegetation change.",

In humans, tests for such functional changes using hemodynamic markers of neural activity have typically relied on cognitive subtraction. However, the temporal resolution of fMRI allows a more direct test than that afforded by cognitive subtraction of the idea that certain brain regions may increase their neural activity during retention delays in humans. Using a method that exploits this temporal resolution, increased functional activity attributable to a retention delay for spatial information in regions proximate to/within the right frontal eye field and the right superior parietal lobule were detected (in four out of four and three out of four subjects, respectively; this is an internal replication of the results of [E. Zarahn, G.K. Aguirre, M. D'Esposito, Temporal isolation of the neural correlates of spatial mnemonic processing with fMRI, Cognit. Brain Res., 7 (1999) 255-268.]). Second, a model in which ventral and not dorsal prefrontal cortex in humans is involved in simply maintaining spatial information was tested. The results disputed this model as increases in fMRI signal attributable to the retention delay were detected more frequently in dorsal than ventral prefrontal cortex. Third, a model which posited that the intensity of neural activity is causally related to the accuracy of spatial mnemonic representation was tested by comparing retention delay signal between correct and incorrect trials. The results did not support this model in any of the regions tested. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Microfinance programs and institutions are increasingly important in development strategies but knowledge about their impacts is partial and contested. This paper reviews the methodological options for the impact assessment (IA) of microfinance. Following a discussion of the varying objectives of IA it examines the choice of conceptual frameworks and presents three paradigms of impact assessment: the scientific method, the humanities traditional and participatory learning and action (PLA). Key issues and lessons in the practice of microfinance IAs are then explored and it is argued that the central issue in IA design is how to combine different methodological approaches so that a 'fit' is achieved between IA objectives, program context and the constraints of IA costs, human resources and timing. The conclusion argues for a greater focus on internal impact monitoring by microfinance institutions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The theory is for a continuously-stratified fluid, and includes both first order non-linearity and dispersion, as well as the earth's rotation without restriction at the lowest order. We investigate and compare the detailed structure of the waves, paying particular attention to the horizontal and vertical velocity fields, as well as to the more usual characteristics, since it appears this has not been undertaken before. The comparison shows that the simplified but often-used 'KdV physics' is able to reproduce almost all features of the observed solitary waves, such as wavelengths, amplitudes, phase speeds, and horizontal velocity structure, with reasonable success. The magnitude of the vertical velocities, however, is significantly underestimated by the theory, although their qualitative structure is reproduced. The comparison also indicates that the internal solitary waves in nature are likely to produce significant mixing of the seasonal thermocline.",

        "Absrtact": "During the DIVA 1 cruise in May 1994, a series of 19 dives was conducted using the French submersible Nautile at the topographic highs of three volcanic segments centered at 37\u00b017N, 37\u00b050\u2032N and 38\u00b020N, respectively, south of the Azores Triple Junction (ATJ) on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Hydrothermal fluids were collected at the Lucky Strike (LS) hydrothermal field, discovered at 37\u00b017N in 1993, and at a new hydrothermal site called Menez Gwen (MGw) discovered at 37\u00b050N during this cruise. Both systems are relatively shallow compared to other MAR systems with seafloor depths of 1700 and 850 m. respectively, characteristics which make them unique among the already known sites on the MAR. The characteristics of the LS fluids are the same as in 1993 and include temperatures ranging from 170\u00b0C to 324\u00b0C, variable chlorinities lower than seawater, low hydrogen sulfide ( < 3.0 mmol/kg), high Ba concentrations (up to 80 \u03bcmol/kg), low metal concentrations and high gas contents, and distinct chemical end-members indicative of significant geographic control of the venting system. In contrast, the very clear MGw fluids at 37\u00b050\u2032N show a rather uniform exit temperature (285\u00b0C) and chemical compositions with chlorinities (360-380 mmol/kg) lower than at LS and corresponding lower concentrations of cations. H2S (1.8 mmol/kg), metals and silica (8-11.5 mmol/kg), due to the lower temperature (T) and pressure (P) of the system. In the two systems, fluid chemistry is strongly affected by phase separation. At the low-pressure conditions of these sites, phase relations in the NaCl-H2O system dictate production of an extremely low salinity. The higher salinities observed in fluids thus indicate that mixing of extremely low salinity vapor with single-phase hydrothermal seawater is the dominant process controlling Cl concentrations. Depletions and enrichments of elements in solutions are also explained by the involvement of fluid-rock reactions. The enrichment of Ba, K, Cs and Rb in the fluids is linked to the enriched character of these elements in basalts. Relatively high pH and Ca, low Li, Sr and metals are related to the highly altered basaltic substrate in the reaction zone. Low Sr/Ca and high Ca/Na ratios are explained by albitization within the crust. The increase of degassing when approaching the Azores may be related to the carbon-enriched basaltic crust near the Azores hot spot. Isotopic ratios show that CO2, CH2 and helium gases have a magmatic signature. Compared to other deeper sites on the MAR, all fluids collected at LS and MGw are gas-enriched, except for H2S and helium, whose both concentration and isotopic ratio compare well with other hydrothermal fluids. The high CH2 concentration associated with unsaturated hydrocarbons and the high CH4/3 He ratios also suggest a contribution of CH2 generated by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks by Fischer-Tropsch catalysis of CO2 reduction. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.

The Central Zone is divisible into a series of low- to medium-grade granite-greenstone belts and high-grade metamorphic terrains containing reworked Archean material and late Archean to Paleoproterozoic juvenile igneous and sedimentary rocks which developed in intra-continental magmatic arc and intra-arc basin environments bordering the western margin of the Eastern Block. The basement rocks from the Central Zone, regardless of their protolith age, composition and metamorphic grade, record a metamorphic history characterized by nearly isothermal decompression (M2) and then retrogressive cooling (M3) following peak metamorphism (M1). The decompression textures are represented by worm-like hypersthene + plagioclase symplectites or clinopyroxene + orthopyroxene + plagioclase coronas in mafic granulites, hornblende/cummingtonite + plagioclase symplectites in amphibolites, and cordierite coronas and cordierite + orthopyroxene or cordierite + spinel symplectites in pelitic rocks.

Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with, or better than, word-based statistical language models-for both true and automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no hand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a significant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination of prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic models capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the literature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause and pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas pause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.",

The model extends the I-sites library by describing the adjacencies of different sequence-structure motifs as observed in the protein database and, by representing overlapping motifs in a much more compact form, achieves a great reduction in parameters. The HMM attributes a considerably higher probability to coding sequence than does an equivalent dipeptide model, predicts secondary structure with an accuracy of 74.3 %, backbone torsion angles better than any previously reported method and the structural context of \u03b2 strands and turns with an accuracy that should be useful for tertiary structure prediction.

The concepts of light interception and thermal time developed were then used to investigate the mechanism responsible for overyielding in intercropping systems and genotypic differences in the drought adaptation of crops in the semi-arid tropics. The most significant achievements were in the understanding of temporal and spatial complementarity in intercropping and agroforestry systems and the development of plant growth models. More recently, the same concepts have been extended to the capture of below-ground resources in agroforestry systems and rain forests. The most serious remaining challenge is to extend this approach to studies of complex multispecies systems in the humid tropics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Within the past few decades, major losses of seagrass habitats in coastal waters impacted by cultural eutrophication have been documented worldwide. In confronting a pressing need to improve the management and protection of seagrass meadows, surprisingly little is known about the basic nutritional physiology of these critical habitat species, or the physiological mechanisms that control their responses to N and P gradients. The limited available evidence to date already has revealed, for some seagrass species such as the north temperate dominant Zostera marina, unusual responses to nutrient enrichment in comparison to other vascular plants. Seagrasses derive N and P from sediment pore water (especially ammonium) and the water column (most nitrate). The importance of leaves versus roots in nutrient acquisition depends, in part, on the enrichment conditions. For example, a shift from reliance on sediment pore water to increased reliance on the overlying water for N and P supplies has been observed under progressive water-column nutrient enrichment. Seagrasses may be N-limited in nutrient-poor waters with sandy or (less so) organic sediments, and P-limited in carbonate sediments. On the basis of data from few species, seagrasses appear to have active uptake systems for NO3 -and PO4 -3, but NH4 + uptake may involve both low- and high-affinity systems. P(i) uptake affinities reported thus far are much lower than values for active ammonium uptake, but comparable to values for nitrate uptake by leaf tissues. Beyond such basic information, seagrass species have shown considerable variation in nutritional response. Dominance of acropetal versus basipetal nutrient translocation appears to vary among species as an innate trait. While some species follow classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics for N(i) uptake, others have exhibited sustained linear uptake with limited or negligible product feedback inhibition, perhaps in adaptation to oligotrophic environments. Zostera marina also is able to maintain nitrate reductase (NR) activity during dark periods if adequate carbohydrate reserves and substrate are available. Thus, this species can respond to nitrate pulses throughout a diel cycle, rather than being limited as most plants to nitrate uptake during the light period. Further adaptations may have occurred for seagrasses in extremely nitrate-depauperate conditions. For example, Halophila decipiens and H. stipulacea lack inducible NR and apparently have lost the ability to reduce nitrate; and a biphasic rather than hyperbolic P(i) uptake curve, with 'surge' uptake, has been described for Zostera noltii. Many seagrasses respond favorably to low or moderate N and/or P enrichment. However, excessive N(i) loading to the water column can inhibit seagrass growth and survival, not only as an indirect effect by stimulating algal overgrowth and associated light reduction, but - for some species - as a direct physiological effect. The latter direct impact has been most pronounced for plants growing in sandy (nutrient-poor) sediments, and is exacerbated by elevated temperatures and/or light reduction. Ammonia toxicity, known for many vascular plants, has been reported in seagrasses Ruppia drepanensis and Z. marina (125 \u03bcM water-column NH4 +, 5 weeks). Z. marina has shown to be inhibited, as well, by pulsed water-column nitrate enrichment (as low as 3.5-7 \u03bcM NO3 -, 3-5 weeks), which is actively taken up without apparent product feedback inhibition. Inhibition by elevated nitrate has also been reported, with description of the underlying physiological mechanisms, in certain macroalgae and microalgae. In Z. marina, this effect has been related to the high, sustained energy demands of nitrate uptake, and to inducement of internal carbon limitation by the concomitant 'carbon drain' into amino acid assimilation. In contrast, nitrate enrichment can stimulate growth of Z. marina when the sediment, rather than the water column, is the source. Because seagrass species have shown considerable variation in nutritional response, inferences about one well-studied species, from one geographic location, should not be applied a priori to that species in other regions or to seagrasses in general. Most of the available information has been obtained from study of a few species, and the basic nutritional physiology of many seagrasses remains to be examined and compared across geographic regions. Nonetheless, the relatively recent gains in general understanding about the physiological responses of some seagrass species to nutrient gradients already have proven valuable in both basic and applied research. For example, physiological variables such as tissue C:N:P content have begun to be developed as integrative indicators of nutrient conditions and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. To strengthen insights for management strategies to optimize seagrass survival in coastal waters adjacent to exponential human population growth and associated nutrient inputs, additional emphasis is critically needed to assess the role of variable interactions - among inorganic as well as organic N, P and C, environmental factors such as temperature, light, and other community components - in controlling the physiology, growth and survival of these ecologically important marine angiosperms.

The chronostratigraphy of the cores is based on planktonic \u03b418O records, 14C AMS-dating, and the recognition of Heinrich Events H1 through H4. Increased abundances of suspension feeding benthic foraminifers, denoted as 'Epibenthos Group', closely match areas where the recent MOW core layers impinge on the continental slope at 800 and 1300 m water depth, and near-bottom current velocities are enhanced. Elevated 'Epibenthos Group' abundances, increased benthic \u03b413C, and sedimentological evidence for winnowing and erosion are found in glacial sections up to the earliest Termination I in cores at water depths between 1600 and 2200 m off southern Portugal. The combined evidence reveals enhanced current activity at these depths due to a deep glacial MOW. The MOW advection at the Portuguese margin during the last Glacial was about 700 m deeper than today, conceivably forced by increased MOW density due to higher salinity and colder temperatures of Mediterranean waters. The deep MOW current gradually decreased in strength and shoaled to 1300 m water depth during the Termination and early Holocene. A shallow MOW core layer became active with the onset of Termination I at depths between 600 and 1000 m. Both the shallow and deep MOW current culminated during the Younger Dryas period. The present flow pattern with two MOW core layers centred at 800 and 1300 m water depth was established between 7.5 and 5.5 ka. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Since the mid-1980s a previously undescribed disease has affected moose in south-western Sweden. Investigations made to reveal evidence of a viral aetiology have proved unsuccessful. Trace element studies in apparently healthy moose shot during regular hunting suggested a trace element imbalance, with excessive molybdenum uptake causing secondary copper deficiency. The results also indicated a possible chromium deficiency. To verify this hypothesis, an experimental study was performed in male goats fed a semi-synthetic diet for 1.5 years. The animals were kept and treated in four groups: Controls, Cu-deficient group (group 1), Cr-deficient group (group 2), and combined Cu- and Cr-deficient group with additional supplementation of tetrathiomolybdate for 10 weeks at the end of the study (group 3). The present paper presents tissue contents of trace and minor elements, haematology and clinical chemical parameters. Feed consumption and weight development, as well as pathological and histopathological investigations, were also performed in this study, but these results are presented elsewhere. Changes in trace element concentrations were determined by comparing groups 1, 2 and 3 with the control group. Increased concentrations were observed for Al, Ca, Co, Fe, Mo, Pb, Se in the liver; for Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Mo in the kidneys; and for Mn and Mo in the ribs. Considerable accumulation of Mn in ribs seems to be a useful way to determine oxidative stress. Decreases in Mg and P in all organs and blood serum is characteristic of Cu deficiency and molybdenosis. Also the ratio of Ca/Mg was increased as the result of tissue lesions causing an intracellular increase in Ca and decrease in Mg. The trace element changes observed in group 1 were enhanced by the Mo supplementation in group 3, resulting in characteristic patterns, 'spectra' of changes. The alterations were not as remarkable in group 2 as in the two other groups. However, Cr deficiency considerably influenced Al, Co, V and to a smaller extent also Mn in ribs. In groups 1 and 2, only a few minor changes were detected in the haematological parameters, probably caused by increased adrenal activity after transportation of the animals. In group 3, severe anaemia was present but also a leukopenia. For the different clinical chemical parameters measured, all three groups showed changes, explained mainly by the altered activity of enzymes induced by trace element deficiencies and imbalance. Impaired carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was seen in groups 1 and 3, with increased concentrations of glucose, lactate and triglycerides in serum. Increased concentrations of total bilirubin were measured in all three groups (bile stasis was also seen post mortem). A considerably increased concentration of serum urea was found in group 3, although there were no indications of renal insufficiency or dehydration. Regarding hormones, a substantial decrease was seen in thyroxine (T4) in group 3 as a result of the molybdenosis, but a minor decrease was also seen in group 1. Insulin on the other hand showed increased levels in group 3 - and especially in group 2 due to the Cr deficiency but also affected by the molybdenosis. As could be expected, Cu deficiency (groups 1 and 3) caused low levels of caeruloplasmin, secondarily affecting the Fe metabolism in these animals. Protein abnormalities, detected as altered electrophoretic patterns of serum proteins, were also seen mainly in group 3. The findings were also confirmed by multivariate data analysis, where PCA revealed the overall impact of the deficiencies, and PLS regression coefficients indicated the influence on the various analytes.

        "Absrtact": "An unusual eclogite pod containing impure jadeite to omphacite pyroxene with anti-phase domain (APD) visible under the optical microscope is hosted in a medium-grade matrix in the Leaota Massif. Textural relationships support the hypothesis of garnet formation by peritectic reactions involving high-jadeite clinopyroxene, while inclusions entrapped in garnet, mainly a wide range of amphibole compositions, seemingly crystallised from a fluid phase in disequilibrium with the garnet host. Thermobarometric estimates indicate UHP, HT peak conditions (2.8-3.2 GPa, 780-840\u00b0C) inconsistent with those of the associated rocks, followed by a complicated exhumation path. The P-T-array of the retrograde path suggests syn-subduction exhumation and tectonic inclusion in a melange with a matrix derived from the accretionary wedge. Partial melting of the subducting slab, which induces tectonic weakening, may be an effective mechanism in detaching and enclosing small eclogite pods in metamorphic terrains.

        "Absrtact": "Carbon and strontium isotope studies of numerous drillcore and outcrop sections within individual Australian Neoproterozoic basins, in a tectonic and sedimentologic framework, have allowed the construction of isotopic records for the interval 830-750 Ma. This, combined with the discovery of a restricted stratigraphic range for the acritarch Cerebrosphaera buickii in mid-Neoproterozoic strata of Australia, makes possible correlation with successions in Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen. That part of the mid-Neoproterozoic succession in Spitsbergen which contains C. buickii was previously considered younger than the Sturtian glacial epoch, but this study has indicated that the Akademikerbreen Group is older than that. A correlation scheme is proposed along five tie lines, and is based on a correlation between Australia and Canada at ~830 Ma, and Australia, Spitsbergen and Namibia at ~760 Ma. The lowest ever recorded seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the upper Shaler Supergroup of Canada (0.70561-0.70670) compare with ratios in evaporites of the ~830 Ma Bitter Springs Formation, Amadeus Basin, Australia (0.70568-0.70720). Comparable \u03b413C(carb) records support a correlation. At about 760 Ma, a correlation is made between the heaviest mid-Neoproterozoic \u03b413C(carb) values of 7.2\u2030 (upper Burra Group, Adelaide Rift Complex) and 8.1\u2030 (Kanpa Formation, western Officer Basin) in Australia, 8.5\u2030 in Spitsbergen (Backlundtoppen Formation, Akademikerbreen Group), and 8.5\u2030 in Namibia (Ombombo Subgroup, Congo Craton). The stratigraphic range of C. buickii in Australia and Spitsbergen supports this correlation. A compilation of \u03b413C(carb) and 87Sr/86Sr records between about 830 and 750 Ma from Australia, Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen reveals numerous negative excursions, which are not associated with preserved glacial deposits. It is necessary, therefore, to consider additional models to the 'Snowball Earth' to explain the large and rapid carbon isotopic excursions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Partition coefficients of the rare earth elements (REE) and the high field strength elements (HFSE: Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta) among clinopyroxenes, garnets, and andesitic to granodioritic melts were experimentally determined at pressures ranging from 1 to 3 GPa and temperatures between 900 and 1150\u00b0C. Natural rocks of quartz-dioritic and basaltic composition were used as starting materials. Melt compositions covered a range from dioritic to quartz-dioritic and granodioritic. Partition coefficients obtained from experiments with different doping levels at the same run condition indicate that Henry's Law is fulfilled. Partition coefficients were investigated as a function of temperature and phase compositions. Apparent correlations between the clinopyroxene partition coefficients of the REE and degree of depolymerization expressed as nonbridging oxygens per tetrahedron (NBO/T) are due to variations in the Na contents of the clinopyroxenes which are controlled by pressure or NBO/T. Based on the model of Blundy and Wood (1994), which accounts for the strain associated with placing a cation on a particular crystallographic site when the radius of the cation differs from the optimal radius for that site, significant differences between Zr- and Hf partition coefficients as well as correlations between Ti and REE partition coefficients can be explained in terms of differences of their ionic radii. For garnets D(La)/D(Yb) ratios change as a function of temperature much more than for clinopyroxenes. This is also consistent with the Blundy and Wood (1994) model.

        "Absrtact": "This paper formally incorporates parameter uncertainty and model error into the implementation of contingent claim models. We make hypotheses for the distribution of errors to allow the use of likelihood based estimators consistent with parameter uncertainty and model error. We then write a Bayesian estimator which does not rely on large sample properties but allows exact inference on the relevant functions of the parameters (option value, hedge ratios) and forecasts. This is crucial because the common practice of frequently updating the model parameters leads to small samples. Even for simple error structures and the Black-Scholes model, the Bayesian estimator does not have an analytical solution. Markov chain Monte Carlo estimators help solve this problem. We show how they extend to some generalizations of the error structure. We apply these estimators to the Black-Scholes. Given recent work using non-parametric function to price options, we nest the B-S in a polynomial expansion of its inputs. Despite improved in-sample fit, the expansions do not yield any out-of-sample improvement over the B-S. Also, the out-of-sample errors, though larger than in-sample, are of the same magnitude. This contrasts with the performance of the popular implied tree methods which produce outstanding in-sample but disastrous out-of-sample fit as Dumas, Fleming and Whaley (1997) show. This means that the estimation method is as crucial as the model itself. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Early to mid-Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks of the southern Sierras Pampeanas tectono-stratigraphic terrane, northwestern Argentina, host diverse metallic mineral deposits of Au, Ni-Cu, Ag-Pb-Zn, W, Li, Be, Nb, LREE and Th. Integration of deposit geology, 40Ar-39Ar geochronology and stable isotope studies with regional geological mapping and U-Pb zircon dating, has led to the resolution of three principal metallogenic epochs. Ordovician intrusion-hosted Ni-Cu sulfide deposits and rare-metal-enriched pegmatites were succeeded by a province-wide metallogenic epoch and concurrent tectonic processes during the Devonian. This epoch was characterized by mesothermal lode Au deposits, high-level Ag-Pb-Zn veins, W \u00b1 Cu-bearing veins and replacements, and various pegmatite- and granite-related lithophile element deposits. Finally, Miocene-Pliocene epithermal Au-Ag mineralization developed during Andean tectonic events. Sericitic alteration associated with mesothermal lode Au (\u00b1 Cu \u00b1 Ag) in the Sierra de Las Minas and Sierras de Cordoba yields Devonian 40Ar-39Ar step heating ages in the ranges 382-393 and 351-378 Ma, respectively. These ages span the timing of Ag-Pb-Zn sulfide-quartz veining in the El Guaico district (386 \u00b1 4 Ma, sericite), and W-bearing quartz vein mineralization in the Aguas de Ram\u00f3n and El Morro districts which yielded muscovite ages of 366 \u00b1 1 and 363 \u00b1 1 Ma, respectively. Oxygen isotope \u03b418OSMOW compositions of the Au, Ag-Pb-Zn and W ore-forming fluids, calculated from quartz, white mica and chlorite isotope ratios, range from 5.2\u2030 to 10.8\u2030 (n = 32), whereas calculated \u03b4DSMOW compositions range from -61\u2030 in the La Rioja Au systems to -141\u2030 in the W veins (n = 9). Sulfide \u03b434S values range from 1.5\u2030 to 10.0\u2030, averaging 6.5\u2030 (n = 15). The oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope data suggest contributions to the ore fluids of either D-depleted meteoric waters that have reacted extensively with metasedimentary rocks, or fluids equilibrated with degassed felsic magmas, or mixtures of both. This mineralization formed during and up to 20-30 Ma after widespread emplacement of high-level peraluminous to metaluminous granites, which yielded U-Pb zircon ages of 404 \u00b1 6-382 \u00b1 6 Ma. The Devonian Au deposits are localised in transcurrent and reverse fault and shear zones that may be related to collision of the Chilenia terrane with the western margin of Gondwana during the newly defined Achalian orogeny. These deposits are considered to be members of the mesothermal lode Au family of systems found worldwide. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

We distinguish 18 features (Z-I) in the \u03b413C(carbonate) and \u03b413C(organic) curves: two intervals of well-defined variation in 87Sr/86Sr; and two peaks in the variation of \u03b434S(sulfate). Newly acquired isotopic data in Australia enable correlation with Canada: the Gillen Member of the Bitter Springs Formation, estimated to be about 840 Ma, is correlated with the upper Shaler Supergroup; the Sturtian glacials, about 700 Ma, with the Rapitan glacials; and the Marinoan glacials, about 600 Ma, with the Ice Brook glacials. We recognize only these two major glaciations, and possibly a third minor glaciation, at 570 Ma. Columns in Poland, Namibia, Iran, and Siberia, and possibly Oman and Mongolia provide correlation by \u03b413C, and in Svalbard, Siberia, Oman, and Mali by 87Sr/86Sr. The inter-glacial (700-600 Ma) peak of \u03b434S(sulfide) enables correlation among Australia, Namibia, and China. Two icehouse states were preceded by massive sequestering of CO2 and accompanied by catastrophic declines in biological productivity. During and immediately after the older, Sturtian, glaciation, the deeper parts of the ocean were anoxic and contained sufficient ferrous iron to sequester very large amounts of sulfur derived from bacterial reduction of sulfate; the evidence suggests that the resultant huge shift in the sulfur isotropic composition was global and accompanied by the reduction of as much as half the sulfate in the anoxic parts of the oceans. The effects of the Pan-African orogeny include mountain building and a high rate of sedimentation, which resulted in the burial of large amounts of organic matter and concomitant oxygenation of the hydrosphere and atmosphere. This reinforced a trend in oxygenation that began before the second, Marinoan, glaciation. A second huge sulfur isotope anomaly accompanies the tectonism, and has been explained previously as possibly resulting from the desiccation and flushing of evolving ocean basins. This may be linked to a remarkable carbon isotope anomaly immediately preceding the Cambrian: the anomaly could be due to release of methane from oceanic clathrates de-stabilized by combined sea level fall and global warming resulting from volcanic release of CO2.

In the framework of background studies and sensitivity estimations for the INTEGRAL and MINISAT-01 projects, a wide range of materials has been irradiated with proton beams at different energies to identify the induced unstable isotopes and their production cross-sections. In this paper we present experimental results obtained from the analysis of such irradiation experiments.

The paper summarizes the structure of the TREC work and analyses the experimental data in some detail. The analysis of the tests is presented through a series of key questions about indexing models, document and query descriptions, search strategies, etc. The assessment confirms that statistically-based methods perform as well as any, and that the nature and treatment of the user's request is by far the dominant factor in performance. One implication is that TREC should move into a new phase targeted on key comparisons and task specifications designed to deliver substantive new information, in particular shifting towards situated IR that addresses the user's context and contribution to searching.",

        "Absrtact": "We report the first 39Ar-40Ar ages from the three early basic shield-like massifs of Tenerife, Canary islands, and couple these with detailed major and trace element chemistry to constrain the nature and timing of the mantle melting processes. The massifs have chemically different sources, and independent evolutionary histories. The Teno and Roque del Conde massifs appear chemically to represent the products of single mantle melting cycles, with progressive decrease in mean melt fraction and increase in mean melting depth in younger rocks. The Teno massif (NW) was erupted in a short time period around 6.0-6.4 Ma, while at least the lower half of the Roque del Conde massif (SW) is older than 11 Ma. In contrast, the Anaga massif (NE) is polygenetic, with 39Ar-40Ar ages ranging from 8.0-4.2 Ma, and no simple stratigraphic chemical progression. These ages run counter to published suggestions of progressive younging of Canary shield stages to the southwest. Basic rocks in all three massifs are the result of much deeper melting and smaller melt fractions than equivalent units in Gran Canaria, but nevertheless the melting column must have extended significantly into the spinel facies, requiring substantial disruption of the local lithosphere. The age and melting relationships broadly support the mantle blob model for Canary magmatism proposed by Hoernle and Schmincke (Hoernle, K., Schminke, H.-U., 1993. The role of partial melting in the 15-Ma geochemical evolution of Gran Canaria: a blob model for the Canary hotspot. J. Petrol. 34, 599-626). In all three massifs, extensive fractional crystallisation has taken place at crustal levels so that mean MgO contents are only some 6-7%. The fractionation sequence is olivine-clinopyroxene-magnetite in basaltic compositions, with the involvement of plagioclase, amphibole and apatite only to generate the infrequent more evolved hawaiites to benmoreites. Despite the abundance of basanitic magmas in the Tenerife older massifs, these follow a differentiation trend towards weakly undersaturated benmoreite rather than to phonolite. This probably reflects early crystallisation of magnetite, perhaps resulting from somewhat high oxygen fugacity. The chemical evidence for replenished magma chambers in Tenerife described by Neumann et al. (Neumann, E.R., Wulff-Oedersen, E., Simonsen, S.L., Pearson, N.J., Mart\u00ed, J., Mitjavila, J., 1999. Evidence for fractional crystallisation of periodically refilled magma chambers in Tenerife, Canary Islands. J. Petrol. 40, 1089-1123) is a consequence of treating as a single cogenetic suite the products of several magmatic systems that differ in parental melt fraction. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

Data sets for this purpose contain data from spatially extensive networks of sites. The data are either directly comparable to model output or readily interpretable in terms of modelled climate variables. Data sets must contain sufficient documentation to distinguish between raw (primary) and interpreted (secondary, tertiary) data, to evaluate the assumptions involved in interpretation of the data, to exercise quality control, and to select data appropriate for specific goals. Four data bases for the Late Quaternary, documenting changes in lake levels since 30 14C kyr BP (the Global Lake Status Data Base), vegetation distribution at 18 14C kyr and 6 14C kyr BP (BIOME 6000), aeolian accumulation rates during the last glacial-interglacial cycle (DIRTMAP), and tropical terrestrial climates at the Last Glacial Maximum (the LGM Tropical Terrestrial Data Synthesis) are summarised. Each has been used to evaluate simulations of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21 calendar kyr BP) and/or mid-Holocene (6 cal. kyr BP) environments. Comparisons have demonstrated that changes in radiative forcing and orography due to orbital and ice-sheet variations explain the first-order, broad-scale (in space and time) features of global climate change since the LGM. However, atmospheric models forced by 6 cal. kyr BP orbital changes with unchanged surface conditions fail to capture quantitative aspects of the observed climate, including the greatly increased magnitude and northward shift of the African monsoon during the early to mid-Holocene. Similarly, comparisons with palaeoenvironmental datasets show that atmospheric models have underestimated the magnitude of cooling and drying of much of the land surface at the LGM The inclusion of feedbacks due to changes in ocean- and land-surface conditions at both times, and atmospheric dust loading at the LGM, appears to be required in order to produce a better simulation of these past climates. The development of Earth system models incorporating the dynamic interactions among ocean, atmosphere, and vegetation is therefore mandated by Quaternary science results as well as climatological principles. For greatest scientific benefit, this development must be paralleled by continued advances in palaeodata analysis and synthesis, which in turn will help to define questions that call for new focused data collection efforts.",

Model results are presented for two test periods, the whole of one winter for which daily observations are available, and a short subset for which hourly data were presented. The best results are those given by MACRO with an expert user, although satisfactory results were also obtained from CRACK-NP and for the longer test period by PLM. SIMULAT was less successful in modelling the site because it did not include an adequate representation of the site hydrology, it was unable to predict the leaching of pesticide. MACRO was also used by a second modelling group who were less familiar with both the code and the site. Although the initial uncalibrated runs from this group were poor, the final calibrated results were almost as good as those derived by the 'expert' user. The simulations showed the difficulty of deriving adequate representations, even where relatively complete soil physical data are available. A shortcoming of the dataset provided was the lack of detailed soil moisture observations, particularly to define the initial conditions. From a well-monitored site, many observations of site hydrology (water table position, drainflow and surface flow) were available, but significantly, fewer pesticide concentrations in either the soil or the discharges were available. Models could thus be evaluated only in terms of their ability to predict the magnitude and timing of major pesticide leaching events. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Together with the fact that most modelers calibrated at least part of their model, the possibility for evaluating model concepts was limited. In the case of bentazone, most model predictions were within the 95% confidence intervals of the observations. In the case of ethoprophos, model performance was often poor due to the ignorance of volatilization, kinetic sorption and adaptation of the microbial population. Most models were calibrated using on-site measured data, limiting the possibility for extrapolation for policy-oriented applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The performance of 10 deterministic one-dimensional dynamic pesticide leaching models with different complexity was evaluated using data collected on a humic sandy soil with a shallow ground water table in the Netherlands. Both mechanistic models, based on the solution of the governing flow equations (the Richards equation for soil water and the convection dispersion equation for solute flow) and functional, more empirical models were considered in the analysis. Simulations were carried out by 18 modellers allowing the characterisation of model performance in terms of user specific model parameterisation. Both uncalibrated and calibrated results are presented which demonstrate the impact of model calibrations on modelling results. In this paper, the ability of the models to correctly represent the physical transport processes is evaluated, while in a subsequent paper (Tiktak, 2000. Agric. Water Manage. Vol. 44, pp 119-134), the potential of the models to represent pesticide fate correctly will be assessed. Model calibration had a major impact on the simulation of water flow in soils. In general, after calibration, the Richards' type models were superior to the capacity type models. However, user-specific hydraulic parameter estimation procedures introduce considerable variability in model performance which sometimes overrules conceptual model differences (Richards'/capacity). The evaluation of the solute transport component of the models was inhibited by the lack of reliable tracer data. Heat transport modelling in the top soil was not felt as being a bottleneck in our modelling technology. A plea is made for developing good modelling practices in which guidelines for selecting robust parameter estimation methods are defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We performed a statistical analysis, both for stressed and non-stressed seed groups, using Poisson distribution as a suitable model for representing the number of non-germinated seeds in a standard experiment with 33 seeds in the same Petri dish. Finally, we have considered the most repeated potencies (30x and 45x), computing the sample odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the population OR. Our results show significant reproducible effects of some As2O3 decimal potencies, particularly As2O3 45x. in stressed seeds, even decimal potencies of water seem to give significant results compared to control, whereas high dilutions of As2O3 without potentization never show significant effects.",

This paper presents the methodology and major conclusions of a test of pesticide-leaching models. Twelve models simulating the vertical one-dimensional movement of water, solute, heat, and, in particular, pesticides, through the soil profile were used by 36 different modellers. The adopted modelling codes differ in terms of modelling concepts and modelling hypothesis. Modellers were affiliated to industry and to the scientific community as well. Four quality datasets were identified to perform the analysis. The dataset included field and lysimeter data, collected in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and the UK. As well, non-structured as structured soils were available in the dataset. To elucidate the ability to model correctly water transport, solute transport, heat transport and pesticide transport in soils, a stepwise evaluation approach was followed. Splitting up the experimental dataset enabled us to quantify the calibration capability and the prediction capability of the models. The simulations were performed by different model users enabling us also to characterise output variability in terms of user dependent interpretation of the model input and parameters. Recommendations are formulated for improving the quality of modelling datasets, and the process description of water, solute, and heat transport in a pesticide-leaching model, plus the process description of pesticide fate. Application of the principles of good modelling practice (GMP) is briefly described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In the TCF algorithm, reaction rate constants are estimated from the absorbance versus time data obtained from selective wavelengths. In this case, wavelengths are selected at which mainly one species is absorbing in time. In CCR, pure spectra of reacting absorbing species and the reaction rate constants are estimated simultaneously.Both TCF and CCR have been applied to experimental data. The reaction rate constants and the individual pure spectra of the reacting absorbing species were estimated simultaneously from the UV-VIS spectra taken in time of the two-step biochemical consecutive reaction of 3-chlorophenylhydrazonopropane dinitrile with 2-mercaptoethanol. This reaction was performed under second order and pseudo-first order conditions. For both conditions, the signal-to-noise ratio was approximately the same. However, if second order conditions are chosen, the first reaction step is very slow, which results in small absorbance differences in time. For the pseudo-first order dataset, the best precision of the reaction rate constant estimates has been obtained with TCF. For the second order dataset, CCR performed the best with respect to the precision of the reaction rate constant estimates. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Bank gullies are gullies that are formed due to a height drop caused by a terrace or a river bank, which develop by headward retreat in erodible hillslopes. This study aims (i) to investigate the morphology of actively eroding bank gullies, i.e., geometrical characteristics resulting from past erosion and active erosion processes shaping the gully, and, (ii), to find relationships with environmental site characteristics, such as topographical parameters, material properties and climate. The ultimate goal is to identify the most important controlling factors of past and present bank gully erosion. Fifty-five active bank gullies formed in different lithologies by various erosion processes have been selected in the Guadalentin basin and the surroundings of Guadix (Southeast Spain). For each bank gully site, geometrical and topographical parameters of both the channel and the drainage basin were measured. Erosion features indicating activity at the gully head, such as tension cracks, plunge pools, undercutting, fluting, piping and rill or sheet erosion on sloping side walls were mapped, and samples were taken from distinct lithological layers that were considered to influence the type and intensity of erosion processes. A relationship could be shown between the presence of piping and fluting and a number of material characteristics, including particle size distribution, dispersion behaviour and electrical conductivity. On the other hand, lithology appeared not to be a differentiating factor on gully development in the long run, as expressed by the total eroded volume (V). This parameter was most strongly related to the drainage basin area in which the entire bank gully had been formed (A(o)), explaining 66% of the variance. The relationship is V = 1.75(*) A(o)0.59. No significant difference was found between regression lines through sub-datasets of different soil textural classes. Finally, multiple regression was used to include both topographical parameters and material characteristics in an explanatory and/or predictive equation for the total eroded bank gully volume. The results of the analyses using the entire dataset, including the sites in the Guadalentin as well as in the Guadix area, have been compared with the results for the separate study areas. Differences are not only related to topographical and lithological characteristics, but may also be the consequence of a different climate in the two areas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We find that, due to complexities in the NYSE auction process, up to 40% of reported trades cannot be unambiguously classified as either buyer- or seller-initiated. However, for those trades that can be classified, the Lee-Ready algorithm is 93% accurate. In addition, we construct a firm-specific trade size proxy that is highly effective in separating the trading activities of individual and institutional investors.

We show that the trends observed for quasi-equatorial paths are consistent with predictions from recent tomographic mantle models, when the latter are modified to account for strong heterogeneity at the base of the mantle under the Pacific Ocean and Africa, as documented in several recent studies. Likewise, for polar paths, we show that a large part of the signal could be explained by deep mantle structure. The effects of complex structure in the deep mantle on PKP(AB-DF) travel times should be carefully considered in order to reliably estimate the anisotropic structure of the central part of the inner core.

        "Absrtact": "Background: Toxicity of the respiratory system is quite common after radiotherapy of thoracic tumors; breast cancer patients represent one of the groups for which there is also a long expected survival. The quantification of lung tissue response to irradiation is important in designing treatments associated with a minimum of complications and maximum tumor control. Methods: The study population consisted of 68 patients who received irradiation for breast cancer at Stage II. Radiation pneumonitis was retrospectively assessed on the basis of clinical symptoms and radiological findings. For each patient, a measure of the exposure (i.e., the lung dose- volume histogram [DVH]) and a measure of the outcome was available. Based on these data, a maximum likelihood fitting to the relative seriality model was performed. The uncertainties of the model parameters were calculated and their impact on the dose-response curve was studied. The optimum parameter set was then applied to 5 other patient groups treated for breast cancer, and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was calculated. Each group was individuated by the radiotherapy treatment technique used; the dose distribution in the lung was described by a mean DVH and the incidence of radiation pneumonitis in each group was known. Lung radiosensitivity was assumed to be homogeneous through all of the calculations. Results: The relative seriality model could describe the dataset. The volume effect was found to be relevant in the description of radiation pneumonitis. Age was found to be associated with increased risk of radiation pneumonitis. Two distinct dose-response curves were obtained by splitting the group according to age. The impact of the parameter uncertainties on the dose-response curve was quite large. The parameter set determined could be used predictively on 3 of the 5 patient groups. Conclusion: The complication data could be modeled with the relative seriality model. However, further independent datasets, classified according to the same endpoint, must be analyzed before introducing NTCP modeling in clinical practice. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

They have been studied by a number of researchers as they strongly affect other economic and financial parameters. Contrary to other chaotic financial data, the movement of interest rates has a series of change points owing to the monetary policy of the US government. The basic concept of this proposed model is to obtain intervals divided by change points, to identify them as change-point groups, and to use them in interest rates forecasting. The proposed model consists of three stages. The first stage is to detect successive change points in the interest rates dataset. The second stage is to forecast the change-point group with the backpropagation neural network (BPN). The final stage is to forecast the output with BPN. This study then examines the predictability of the integrated neural network model for interest rates forecasting using change-point detection.",

        "Absrtact": "When spectral variation caused by factors different from the parameter to be predicted (e.g. external variations in temperature) is present in calibration data, a common approach is to include this variation in the calibration model. For this purpose, the calibration sample spectra measured under standard conditions and the spectra of a smaller set measured under changed conditions are combined into one dataset and a global calibration model is calculated. However, if highly non-linear effects are present in the data, it may be impossible to capture this external variation in the model. Recently, a new technique, which is based on selection of robust variables, was proposed for constructing robust calibration models. In this technique, a calibration model is developed which uses a subset of spectral values that are insensitive to external variations.This new technique is compared with global calibration models for constructing robust models in spectrometric applications. Both techniques are applied to two different near infra-red (NIR) spectroscopic applications. The first is the determination of the ethanol, water, and iso-propanol concentrations in a ternary mixture of these components; the second is the determination of the density of heavy oil products. In both applications, the calibration set spectra have been measured at a standard sample temperature and a subset has been measured at sample temperatures deviating from the standard temperature. It has been found that models based on robust variable selection are similar or sometimes better than global calibration models with respect to their predictive ability at different sample temperatures.

The model incorporates the processes of light interception and photosynthesis, leaf area expansion; growth, ageing and senescence of plant tissues, recycling of substrates from senescing tissues, nitrogen uptake, mineralisation of soil organic N, N leaching and grazing. The paper discusses the main structure of the model, its components and the main adaptations required to simulate the growth of tropical pastures. The model was parameterised for kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) growing in dairy systems in highland regions of Costa Rica. This paper also discusses the sensitivity of parameter values and the development of minimum parameter datasets for time and cost-effective implementation of the model.

Alternatively, we designated old growth status using the proportion (\u226515%) of large trees (\u226540 cm DBH) and the subcanopy/canopy tree ratios (>1.5). With these riteria, approximately 11.4% of the boreal mixedwood landbase within northeastern Alberta has an old growth structure. Proportionally, more old growth structure was found in aspen and white spruce mixedwood types, with lesser proportions in pure aspen and white spruce stands.

They may also be treated as outcome measures and correlated with other clinical variables.The performance of each of the seven indices was assessed using data from two large ongoing studies of psychiatric patients: a longitudinal study of affective disorders and a longitudinal study of first-episode psychosis. These two datasets were subjected to bootstrapping techniques in order to calculate both type I error rates and statistical power for each summary statistic. Of the seven indices, Kendall's \u03c4 performed the best as a measure of patients' symptom course. Kendall's \u03c4 appears to offer more statistical power to detect change in course, yet its average type I error rate was comparable to the other indices. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "During early growth, when the apical meristem of a maize plant is close to the soil surface, its temperature may be very different from air temperature. A model is proposed to estimate apex temperature from meteorological data, when the leaf area index is less than 0.5. This model is based on the energy balance of the apical meristem, considered as a vertical cylinder close to the soil surface, called 'apex'. Soil surface temperature was calculated from an energy and water balance of the soil. Input data were hourly standard meteorological data and soil texture. Stomatal conductance was calculated from solar radiation and water vapor deficit. Five field experiments with different soil and climatic conditions were conducted to calibrate and validate the model. The roughness length of the soil surface was used as a calibrating factor. The selected value was 0.3 mm, and was used on all datasets. The agreement between observed and calculated apex temperatures was fairly good, with residual standard deviations between 0.8 and 1.9 K in five experiments, while apex temperature was generally higher than air temperature at screen level by more than 5-7 K during the day. This study showed that the main problem to overcome in estimating apex temperature, is to calculate air temperature at apex height, i.e. at several centimeters from the soil surface. This requires development of precise soil surface temperature models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Purpose: To evaluate the clinical utility of a treatment-planning technique involving the use of CT images obtained during both the static exhalation phase and static inhalation phase (two-phase planning). Methods and Materials: Ten patients with pancreatic or liver tumors underwent CT scanning under static exhale and inhale conditions, after a period of mild ventilation. By setting image positions differently, we were able to treat the two-phase images as one dataset. Each gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured separately and the mixed GTV was used for the two-phase treatment planning. Treatment plans were constructed to compare the two-phase plans with the plans constructed using static exhalation images. The shift of the center of the GTV and kidneys and the minimum dose of GTV were then calculated. Results: The shift of the GTV ranged from 2.6 to 27.3 mm and that of the kidneys from 2.2 to 24 mm. In some patients whose treatment was planned using exhalation planning, the minimum dose of GTV at inhalation was less than 90% of the isocenter dose. Conclusion: Two-phase planning is a simple technique that can visualize tumor and organ movement simultaneously using CT. It further defines adequate field margins around the tumor and prevents unexpected radiation exposure to critical organs. Routine use of this technique for upper abdominal irradiation is recommended.

The principal component analysis (PCA) method was applied to select the appropriate coating materials for organic vapours. A dataset for the multi- channel sensor with 14 PZ crystals for 30 analytes was collected. Six appropriate coating materials for various organic vapours such as amine, carboxylic acid, alcohol and aromatic molecules were selected after comparing the correlation between the 14 coating materials and the first four principal component (PC) factors. These organic molecules can be distinguished clearly by the six-channel PZ flow sensor.

A repeated measures regression method that takes into account the dependence in the data and provides estimates of error is proposed and illustrated using recent emissions data from CARB. A method for calculating confidence intervals for the ratio of means is also derived and illustrated. Using the same dataset, we find that the method currently in use, which fits a polynomial curve to the ratio of mean emissions, slightly underestimates the correction factors when compared with the repeated measures method. However, both methods appear to overestimate values in the middle range of speeds when compared with a method that does not assume a polynomial curve. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The data set is composed of 862 observations from different sites. Within the continental area of China, heat flow values range from 23 to 319 mW/m2, with a mean of 63 \u00b1 24.2 mW/m2. If non-conductive values related to local hydrothermal systems are excluded, the representative average heat flow is 61 \u00b1 15.5 mW/m2 (n = 823), with an associated range of 30-140 mW/m2. Heat flow analysis for each specific subtectonic province shows discernible trends within a tectonic province. The relationships between the heat flow and geological ages based on this new dataset indicate that surface heat flow is obviously more dependent on the last tectonothermal activity than the age of the orogeny. The overall heat flow pattern exhibits high values in the east and in the southwest, and low in the center and northwest parts of the continental area of China, and appears to be dominated largely by the Meso-Cenozoic tectonothermal evolution of the lithosphere. The Cenozoic collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, and the subsequent thickening of the lithosphere; and the lithospheric thinning and volcanomagmatic activities during the Late Mesozoic in East China; can be seen clearly in the heat flow pattern.

The present study is an extension to the excellent study of Cserhati et al. [LC-GC Int., 11 (1998) 240] for the retention behavior of solutes based on their structure. To this end, a dataset of 25 substances as solutes to two different stationary phases (polyethylene-silica and polyethylene-alumina) were analyzed to their structural descriptors and related to their retention behavior as expressed by the logarithms of their capacity factors (log k'). The results were compared to those of Cserhati et al. who studied the same problem using as many as ten different equations based on multiple regression analysis. In the present study a series of new and improved algorithms other than the 'old-fashioned' and problematic steepest descent were examined for training the MLP networks. The proposed methods led to substantial gain in both the prediction ability and the computation speed of the resulting models. For the development and evaluation of the artificial neural network (ANN) systems the same (eight) descriptors proposed by Cserhati were used also in this study. Furthermore, the results were compared to those produced from classical linear multivariate regression such as partial least squares regression (PLS). Some of the proposed ANN models diminished the number of outliers, during their implementation to unseen data (solutes), to zero. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "An important number of palaeomagnetic data have been obtained in Greece during the last 20 years. These data can be schematically divided into two groups according to their age. When plate movements are fairly well constrained, the Cenozoic provides a dense network of palaeomagnetic directions. The general pattern displays eastward declinations broadly distributed over a large distance - from the Ionian islands to the western Greek Rhodope - and westward declinations, less accurately constrained in space and time, in the Southern and Eastern Aegean and in Western Anatolia. Emphasis is given to the evaluation of this dataset by comparing it with new concepts of the regional tectonics. In the Mesozoic-Palaeozoic, more scarcely covered, reliable information is provided about latitudinal movements, resulting in a suggested palaeolatitude of 15-20\u00b0N for almost all studied areas. A model proposing prevailing counterclockwise rotations in the internal Hellenides and strong clockwise rotations for the external Hellenides appears plausible. Finally, issues for future research are outlined. For example. Mio-Pliocene formations from Central Greece, the Pindos ophiolites and Palaeocene-Upper Cretaceous data should receive further attention. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Including the selected data with those for oxygen, xenon, krypton and those obtained recently for 16 partially halogenated hydrocarbons (refrigerants), we propose the following extended scaled equation to represent the surface tension of these substances:\u03c3=kTc(NAVc)2/3(4 .35+4.14\u03c9)t1.26(1+0.19t0.5-0.25t)where t=1-T/Tc is reduced temperature, k, NA, Vc, and \u03c9 are the Boltzmann constant, Avogadro number, the critical volume and the acentric factor, respectively. This equation, which only differs slightly from that proposed by Schmidt et al. [J.W. Schmidt, E. Carrillo-Nava, M.R. Moldover, Fluid Phase Equilibria 122 (1996) 187-206] for refrigerants, yields values for \u03c3 within 3.5% of the experimental values for all these compounds.

However, the majority of this work has been attempted without reference to the needs of ecological process studies. While model initialisation is an important task there are other ways in which remote sensing can be combined with ecological models. This paper identifies four alternative strategies: (i) to use remotely sensed data to provide estimates of variables required to drive ecological process models, (ii) to use remotely sensed data to test, validate or verify predictions of ecological process modes, (iii) to use remotely sensed data to update or adjust ecological process model predictions and (iv) to use ecological process models to understand remotely sensed data. The objectives of the paper are to review the four strategies by reference to examples. Directions for future work are identified for each strategy, which can be grouped in terms of estimation accuracy, issues of spatial and temporal scale, long term comprehensive datasets and development of new methods and models with the emphasis on increased interaction between scientists from the remote sensing and ecological modelling disciplines.

        "Absrtact": "This paper deals with improvements in the accuracy and precision of attenuation measurements in the Earth, obtained from observations of surface waves and free oscillations. We focus our study on the observation of the resonant frequencies of the Earth and propose an improved method for deriving attenuation data from the free-oscillation amplitude decays that reduces uncertainties. We test our method on different theoretical seismograms computed for two different Earth models, a spherically symmetric one (the PREM model) and a laterally heterogeneous one (the M84A model). We compute seismograms for: the spheroidal fundamental mode only, the fundamental mode and overtones, without noise and with actual noise. Some biases related to the method are systematically found and corrected. Our conclusion is that if we fulfill some conditions in attenuation measurements by taking into account different parameters, such as the observed resonance period, the relative amplitude of the peak for the particular great-circle path considered, the noise level of the component in the station considered, it is possible to reduce the uncertainty in amplitude measurements. Doing this, we are more confident in free-oscillation measurements than in those of surface waves. It is evident that the presence of noise may increase the mean Q inferred from long-time series if no care is taken relative to the signal-to-noise level. The method is then systematically applied to a dataset of about one thousand vertical seismograms provided by the GEOSCOPE network after various large earthquakes, which occurred from 1982 to 1995. We determine reliable estimates of the mean frequency and attenuation of the fundamental spheroidal mode for the angular order range l = 21-51 (period range 175-336 s). Some results are discarded for reasons explained. We compare the consistency of this new dataset with previously published Q observations and commonly used models (PREM, Q(M1), Q(L6)). We point out the difficulties of obtaining reliable Q factors and show the discrepancies between surface waves and normal modes measurements. It is noted that surface wave attenuation measurements may be strongly affected by the time window used in order to extract each particular surface wave train, but fit normal modes results, in some cases.

However, few studies have examined how well this method performs when the groups of interest are extremely diverse. We conducted a detailed evaluation of the higher-taxon approach for a highly speciose but neglected group, the macromycete fungi. Using existing UK datasets, we found that at both national and local scales, the species richness of areas could be predicted reasonably closely from their genus-level richness. Family- and order-level data were less informative. However, efficient selection of priority areas for conservation hinges on differences between sites in their biota, as well as their absolute richness. In a simple algorithm designed to explore the consequences of using higher-taxon information for reserve selection, data on genera (but not on families or orders) again performed very well: hypothetical genus-based reserve networks typically captured 98-99% of the macromycete species represented when species-level data were used. Information on genera could successfully identify efficient reserve networks for species because of cross-level congruence in how well different sites complemented one another, as well as congruence in macrofungal richness. Further tests of the higher-taxon approach on highly speciose groups are needed, but the cautious use of genus-level surveys may be the most practical way of identifying priority areas for the conservation of megadiverse taxa.

        "Absrtact": "Neoproterozoic (Sinian) sediments are exceptionally well preserved in the Three Gorges region (western Hubei Province) of the South China block. We report new paleomagnetic results, obtained independently by two separate laboratories, from a total of 157 samples of the 748 \u00b1 12 Ma, basal Sinian Liantuo Formation at its type locality. Detailed thermal demagnetization procedures and least-squares line analyses reveal three distinct magnetic components among the suite of samples. Two overprint components can be distinguished from each other by their laboratory unblocking temperatures. The first to be removed ('C'), always annihilated below 600\u00b0C, is common throughout the dataset but is amenable to least-squares line-fitting in only 37 samples. It yields a pole which in present coordinates resembles Mesozoic overprints identified from previous studies in the Three Gorges region (75.7\u00b0N, 174.3\u00b0E, d(p) = 6.0\u00b0, d(m) = 8.3\u00b0, Q = 4). The higher unblocking-temperature overprint ('B'), always subsidiary to the 'A' component, is more prevalent than 'C' and was identified by line-fitting in 67 samples. The 'B' direction is very steep and generates a paleopole whose in situ coordinates do not resemble the Mesozoic-Cenozoic apparent polar wander path for South China, and whose tilt-corrected coordinates (20.3\u00b0N, 106.2\u00b0E, d(p) = 7.2\u00b0, d(m) = 7.3\u00b0, Q = 5) bear no resemblance to any reliable Phanerozoic paleopoles from the South China block. The steep 'B' direction, if an unbiased representative of an ancient geomagnetic dipole field, was probably acquired some time in the 200 m.y. interval between deposition of the Liantuo Formation at ~750 Ma and Cambrian time. The most stable component is a two-polarity remanence, removed at temperatures predominantly >630\u00b0C, which we infer to reside in hematite. A change in polarity of this component occupies a similar stratigraphic position (within 5 cm) among three outcrops separated by ~100 m lateral distance. We calculate a mean paleomagnetic pole from each of the laboratories' datasets and combine these with a previously determined pole from correlative rocks in Yunnan ['N1' of Zhang and Piper, Precambrian Res. 85 (1997) 173-199], to obtain an overall weighted mean paleomagnetic pole (04.4\u00b0N, 161.1\u00b0E, A95 = 12.9\u00b0, Q = 7) for the South China block at 748 \u00b1 12 Ma. The combined 'Z1' pole is considered to be primary based on its thermal stability, its magnetostratigraphic consistency, and a soft-sediment fold test determined by previous work. Results from individual sampling areas constrain the depositional paleolatitude of the Liantuo Formation and equivalent Sinian rocks to 30-40\u00b0. This result applies to one or both of the stratigraphically adjacent Chang'an and Nantuo glacial deposits; unfortunately, it is neither high nor low enough to refute any of the conceptual models for the enigmatic Neoproterozoic glaciations. The new basal Sinian paleopole, in the context of recent paleomagnetic and geochronological results from Australia, suggests that the Nantuo glaciation is pre-Marinoan. The new 'Z1' pole may also provide constraints on the various proposed reconstructions of South China's position in Rodinia. In particular, a paleoposition adjacent to northwestern Australia at ~750 Ma requires a specific relative orientation between the two blocks. Likewise, if Rodinia were still intact by 750 Ma, South China may have lain between Australia and Laurentia only in an orientation different from that originally proposed in the 'missing link' hypothesis. As a final alternative, the new paleomagnetic data could be used to position South China, Australia, and Laurentia in an immediately post-Rodinian paleogeography around the nascent Pacific Ocean.

        "Absrtact": "In situ energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques have been employed to study the hydrothermal formation of crystalline tobermorite and xonotlite. Alkoxide gels of tobermorite composition with varying aluminium contents (Al/(Al + Si) = 0 to 0.15) were reacted with a saturated calcium hydroxide solution at temperatures varying from 190\u00b0C to 310\u00b0C on the saturated vapour pressure curve. Reaction products consisted of tobermorite, xonotlite or a mixture of both. Tobermorite is stabilised by increasing aluminium content and decreasing temperature, whereas xonotlite forms at higher temperature and lower aluminium contents. Reaction times ranged from 3 to 5 h, with the first Bragg peaks forming within the first 10 min. The formation mechanism involves a two-stage process. Firstly, a poorly crystalline C-S-H gel phase forms, which has good periodicity parallel to the ab plane but is poorly ordered parallel to the c direction. The second stage involves the ordering of the C-S-H gel along the (001) direction to form ordered crystalline tobermorite or xonotlite. Kinetic analysis indicates that the reaction rate is increased with increasing aluminium content and increasing temperature. Activation energies for these reactions at different aluminium contents were calculated from two datasets; firstly, from the change in 2 \u03b8 position of the tobermorite(220)/xonotlite(320) peak during the reaction (19-30 kJ/mol) and secondly, from the rate at which the background hump intensity decreases for each experiment (26-33 kJ/mol).

The concentrations of six constituents are currently evaluated with a classical calibration method. The aim of the study being to improve the precision of the monitoring of the process, inverse calibration linear methods were applied on a synthetic dataset, in order to evaluate the improvement in prediction such methods could yield. Several methods were tested including principal component regression with variable selection, partial least square regression or multiple linear regression with variable selection (stepwise or based on genetic algorithm). Methods based on selected wavelengths are of great interest because the obtained models can be expected to be very robust toward experimental conditions. However, because of the important noise in the spectra due to short accumulation time, variable selection methods selected a lot of irrelevant variables by chance correlation. Strategies were investigated to solve this problem and build reliable robust models. These strategies include the use of signal pre-processing (smoothing and filtering in the Fourier or wavelets domain), and the use of an improved variable selection algorithm based on the selection of spectral windows instead of single wavelengths when this leads to a better model. The best results were achieved with multiple linear regression and stepwise variable selection applied to spectra denoised in the Fourier domain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the development of a Children's Health Test Program under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The Environmental Protection Agency's proposal for the children's health test battery has 12 different assays including general toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, and developmental and reproductive toxicity. The current Environmental Protection Agency testing proposal is an 'all or nothing' test battery. An alternative and preferable approach would be to use a science-based, tiered testing scheme. It is proposed that the Screening Information Dataset program, currently used by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for the Screening Information Dataset-High Production Volume test battery, or equivalent, be considered for the first step. Step 1 would include acute and repeat dose toxicity testing, developmental toxicity testing (first species OECD 414 or OECD 422), reproductive toxicity screening (OECD 415 or 422), and genetic toxicity testing. For this step, the rat would be the initial and only species tested unless the mouse was used for in vivo genetic toxicity. Step 2 of the proposed Children's health test battery would include developmental testing (second species OECD 414) or special mode of action studies performed for those chemicals that proved to be developmental toxicants in Step 1. Those chemicals that tested positive as reproductive toxicants in Step 1 would be tested in a two-generation reproduction study (OECD 416) or a special mode of action study. Steps I and 2 provide information on whether oncogenicity or developmental neurotoxicity testing is useful. Step 3 would include chronic toxicity/oncogenicity testing for those chemicals that tested positive for genetic toxicity in Step 1, and positive for developmental concerns in Step 2. In this step, chemicals would also be tested for developmental neurotoxicity if they showed evidence of neuropathy, behavioral effects, or neurotoxic potential in earlier studies. This stepwise approach would conserve resources and answer scientific questions in a logical, orderly, timely, and cost-effective manner. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

Gediga, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 18 (1998) 93-106] presented a first approach to this problem. Their technique collects values of a single feature into a single value. In this paper we present a novel approach to classificatory filtering, which can be regarded as a generalisation of the approach in the above mentioned paper. This approach is aimed at collecting values of a set of features into a single value. We look at the problem abstractly in the context of lattices. We focus on hypergranules (arrays of sets) in a problem domain, and it turns out the collection of all hypergranules can be made into a lattice. Our solution (namely, LM algorithm) is formulated to find a set of maximal elements for each class, which covers all elements in a given dataset and is consistent with the dataset. This is done through the lattice sum operation. In terms of decision systems, LM collects attributes values while preserving classification structure. To use the filtered data for classification, we present and justify two measures (C0 and C1) for the relationship between two hypergranules. Based on the measures, we propose an algorithm (C2) for classification. Both algorithms are evaluated using real world datasets and are compared with C4.5. The result is analysed using statistical test methods and it turns out that there is no statistical difference between the two. Regression analysis shows that the reduction ratio is a strong indicator of prediction success. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

The correlations and the uncertainties on shear-wave velocities defining the elastic model are estimated by using a procedure based on the same thermodynamic analogies. As a relevant feature, the simulated annealing algorithm permits reducing the usual dependence of the solution on the sometimes arbitrary starting model. A shortcoming linked to the use of this procedure for solving an inversion problem is the necessity of a previous empirical determination of some parameters controlling the annealing process. With this aim, a simulation of a joint inversion of synthetic surface wave dispersion data has been performed. After that, path-averaged velocity dispersion curves corresponding to a Hercynian area of the Iberian Peninsula have been inverted to derive two possible crust and upper mantle elastic structures. Whereas, the first structure has been deduced by considering as unknown variables the shear velocities of the stratified Earth model, the second has been obtained also including the respective layer thicknesses. Both structures are compared with shear velocity and Q\u03b2 models derived by the stochastic inversion procedure in previous studies and from the same Rayleigh waves dataset. Finally, advantages and shortcomings of the inversion of phase and group velocity data by means of simulated annealing are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

A wide range of datasets have been analysed to assess cost distribution across sectors. We calculate the annual total external costs of UK agriculture in 1996 to be \u00a32343 m (range for 1990-1996: \u00a31149-3907 m), equivalent to \u00a3208/ha of arable and permanent pasture. Significant costs arise from contamination of drinking water with pesticides (\u00a3120 m/year), nitrate (\u00a316 m), Cryptosporidium (\u00a323 m) and phosphate and soil (\u00a355 m), from damage to wildlife, habitats, hedgerows and drystone walls (\u00a3125 m), from emissions of gases (\u00a31113 m), from soil erosion and organic carbon losses (\u00a3106 m), from food poisoning (\u00a3169 m), and from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (\u00a3607 m). This study has only estimated those externalities that give rise to financial costs, and so is likely to underestimate the total negative impacts of modern agriculture. These data help to identify policy priorities, particularly over the most efficient way to internalise these external costs into prices. This would imply a redirection of public subsidies towards encouraging those positive externalities under-provided in the market place, combined with a mix of advisory and institutional mechanisms, regulatory and legal measures, and economic instruments to correct negative externalities. Further work examining the marginal costs and benefits of UK agriculture would help to inform future policy development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

To the west, in the western Gawler Craton (Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic), heat flow averages ~ 54 mW m-2 while to the east in the Willyama Inliers (Palaeoproterozoic) heat flow averages ~ 75 mW m-2. We use a regional geochemical dataset comprising > 2500 analyses to show that the anomalous heat flow zone correlates with exceptional surface heat production values, mainly hosted in Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic granites. The median heat production of Precambrian 'basement' rocks increases from < 3 \u03bcW m-3 west of the anomalous zone to ~ 6 \u03bcW m-3 within the anomalous zone. In the highest known part of the heat flow anomaly, Mesoproterozoic gneisses and granites of the Mount Painter Province in the northern Adelaide Fold Belt yield an area-integrated mean heat production of 9.9 \u03bcW m-3. These data suggest that the anomalous heat flow reflects an unusual enrichment in U and Th in this part of the Proterozoic crust, with the total complement of these elements some 2-3 times greater than would be expected for Proterozoic crust on the basis of the global heat flow database. This extraordinary enrichment has played an important role in modulating the thermal regime of the crust in this region, and particularly its response to tectonic activity.

The objective is to provide insights on the interactions between grassland dynamics and water and energy budgets. These three years exhibit drastically different precipitation regimes and thus different vegetation growth. The result of the coupled model showed that for the 3 years, the observed seasonal variation of plant biomass, leaf area index (LAI) are well reproduced by the model. It is also shown that the model simulations of soil moisture, radiative surface temperature and surface fluxes compared fairly well with the observations. Reflectance data in the red, near infrared, and short wave infrared (SWIR, 1600 nm) bands measured by the VEGETATION sensor onboard SPOT-4 were corrected from atmospheric and directional effects and compared to the observed biomass and LAI during the 1998-1999 seasons. The results of this 'ground to satellite' approach established that the biomass and LAI are linearly related to the satellite reflectances (RED and SWIR), and to vegetation indices (NDVI and SWVI, which is a SWlR-based NDVI). The SWIR and SWVI sensitivity to the amount of plant tissues were similar to the classical RED and NDVI sensitivity, for LAI ranging from 0 and 0.8 m2 m-2 and biomass ranging from 0 to 120 g DM m-2. Finally, LAI values simulated by the vegetation model were fed into a canopy radiative transfer scheme (a 'model to satellite' approach). Using two leaf optical properties datasets, the computed RED, NIR and SWlR reflectances and vegetation indices (NDVI and SWVI) compared reasonably well with the VEGETATION observations in 1998 and 1999, except for the NIR band and during the senescence period, when the leaf optical properties present a larger uncertainty. We conclude that a physically-sound linkage between the vegetation model and the satellite can be used for red to short wave infrared domain over these grasslands. These different results represent an important step toward using new generation satellite data to control and validate model's simulations at regional scale.

Seven ecological indices (S, number of phytoplankton species; N, total number of individuals; DMg, Margalef\u2019s index; DMn, Menhinick's index; DOd, Odum\u2019s species per thousand individuals; H\u2019, Shannon\u2019s Diversity index; E, Evenness index), based on phytoplankton community data collected from Saronicos Gulf, Greece were used for describing the eutrophication state of the sea environment. A representation of the spatial distribution for each ecological index was developed using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. A eutrophication scale for each index was also developed for indicating four different trophic levels in the marine environment (eutrophic, upper-mesotrophic, lower-mesotrophic, oligotrophic); categorization of the interpolated values of each index resulted in a clear illustration of these trophic levels on seven thematic maps. Two methodological procedures were finally applied for synthesizing the information of these thematic maps. The purpose was the development of a final map illustrating the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the study area. The first procedure was based on the integration of unsupervised and supervised classification methods, widely used in the field of remote sensing, while the second one on the overlay technique, simply carried out within the frame of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The hybrid unsupervised/supervised classification method can assess the optimal number of classes in which data values from simultaneously considered parameters could be allocated, while the overlay technique is an additive procedure not taking into account existing trends in the dataset. The advantages and disadvantages of each procedure are further discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "We report Pb isotopic compositions for 35 samples of the volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea from the Hawaiian Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP-1) core at Hilo. These data were obtained with an external precision of ~ 100 ppm (2\u03c3(ext.)) on the ratios 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb by using a Pb triple spike to correct for instrumental mass fractionation. The Pb isotopic compositions in the lower section (1200 to 280 m) of the core sample 200 to 400 ka-old Mauna Kea lavas, and display two well-defined linear arrays in 207Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb isotope spaces. There is a suggestion that Mauna Loa (0 to 280 m depth) also displays such linear array(s). However, analysis of the Mauna Loa samples is complicated by residual contamination and/or sample heterogeneity. While these latter data exhibit a satisfactory array in 208Pb/204Pb vs. 206Pb/204Pb, there still remains scatter in 207Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb space, making it difficult to assess the true Pb isotope systematics of Mauna Loa. The presence of two linear Pb isotopic arrays in Mauna Kea can be interpreted as either reflecting two parallel isochrons or in terms of binary mixing. If interpreted as isochrons, the 207Pb/204Pb-206Pb/204Pb systematics correspond to an age of ~ 1.9 Ga. Comparison of measured Th/U ratios in the lavas and those inferred from Pb isotope systematics strongly suggest that the Pb isotopic arrays reflect binary mixing, and this bears directly on the question of how many distinct components are present in the Hawaiian plume. Most of the new Mauna Kea data lie well outside the mixing-component triangle defined in the literature by the 'Kea', 'Loihi', and 'Koolau' components. On the basis of the relationships between Pb isotope ratios in 3D and a principal component analysis of the Mauna Kea Pb isotope dataset, we show here that a three-component mixing model can in principle explain both mixing lines. However, such an explanation requires a highly specific set of mixing conditions in order to produce parallel arrays in Pb isotope space (2D and 3D). Therefore, our preferred interpretation is that the two arrays reflect binary mixing, with four discrete source components involved in the generation of the Kea lavas. Comparison of the Pb isotope characteristics of these lavas with those of East Pacific Rise (EPR) MORB glasses further suggests that EPR-type Pacific lithosphere does not contribute to the source of Kea lavas. The position of samples along the mixing lines does not correlate with stratigraphic height in the core, and therefore the age of the lavas. Rather, it appears as though the relative proportions of the endmembers are controlled by the spatial configuration of these endmembers, and by melting and transport processes in the source itself. The stratigraphic fluctuations of Pb and Sr isotopes contrast with the monotonic decrease of \u03b5(Nd) and \u03b5(Hf) values as a function of age. This may in part be explained by differences in analytical precision of isotope measurements relative to the total range of values observed. This analytical resolution is far higher for Pb than for the other radiogenic isotopes. Alternatively, the observed fluctuation may be caused by the mobility of lead (as well as Rb and/or Sr) during the ancient differentiation process that created the differences in parent-daughter ratios.

        "Absrtact": "The non-Lambertian nature of the terrestrial surface is a major source of unexplained variability in wide-swath satellite sensor data acquired in the solar reflective wave-lengths, hindering quantitative analysis in the spectral, temporal, and locational domains. The interactions of light with the surface are governed by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BBDF), and modeling this is one of the most promising methods for describing and explaining this variability. Here the Roujean linear semi-empirical kernel-driven (LiSK) model was tested against two independent bidirectional reflectance factor datasets that were acquired close to ground level over seminatural semiarid grasslands in Xilingol, Inner Mongolia (People's Republic of China) and in Arizona (United States). The objectives were to determine how well the model is able to describe and explain observed bidirectional reflectance factor distributions in the red and near-infrared wavelengths, to explore its utility in correcting such data for angular variations, and the likely impact of such corrections on cover-type discrimination. The sensitivity of the model to reductions in the number and angular distribution of the bidirectional reflectance observations with which it is inverted was also evaluated. The results show that the model is able to describe the observed multiangular BRFs with good accuracy and with low sensitivity to the number of angular inputs, with observations in the forward-scattering direction shown to be important in constraining inversions. The behavior of retrieved parameters indicates that one or more of the simplifying assumptions made in the model derivation is likely to be too severe for explaining BRDF in the near-infrared region; non-negligible anisotropic multiple scattering and the assumption of an optically thick medium mean that a physical interpretation of parameters is unlikely to be valid. However, the model is shown to provide an effective means of correcting for BRDF effects, allowing greater precision and consistency than hitherto possible in the retrieval of surface spectral reflectance over semiarid grasslands and concrete improvements in cover-type discrimination.The interactions of light with the surface are governed by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and modeling this is one of the most promising methods for describing and explaining variability.

These sites were concentrated in east Scotland and were the locations of Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) field experiments and surveys related to tillage and compaction. Compactibility was determined by a rammer method on sieved soil. The coefficient of variability of compactibility (as maximum dry bulk density) was relatively low between sites (9.5%) and within site (4%). The soils covered a wide range of textures; sand contents ranged from 1.7 to 93.5 g 100 g-1 and clay contents ranged from 2.5 to 49.1 g 100 g-1. However, liquid limit was more important than particle size fractions in the prediction of compactibility. Loss-on-pretreatment prior to measurement of particle soil distribution was taken as a measure of readily oxidisable soil organic matter. This fraction was more variable and more relevant than total organic matter in determining mechanical behaviour. Compactibility was predicted adequately by a combination of loss-on-pretreatment and liquid limit. Maximum dry bulk density and liquid limit were identified as important characteristics of the dataset and would be suitable parameters for measurement of soil physical/behavioural quality. Although particle density was not particularly important in predicting compactibility, it ranged from 2.36 to 2.87 Mg m-3. Awareness of this variability is important for properties estimated by a calculation involving particle density. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In the paper, we present descriptors for color and shape information in images that we proposed for MPEG-7. In particular, we describe two ways of capturing color content in images called Color Histogram and Region Color. These descriptors are suitable for a wide variety of applications requiring image-to-image matching and object-to-image matching. We also present descriptors for capturing shape information on objects and within images called affine structure and location hash tree. These shape descriptors enable a pose-invariant localization and recognition of 2d patterns. The utility of color and shape descriptors is demonstrated through experiments on the MPEG-7 dataset.",

        "Absrtact": "The anthropogenic increase in radiatively active gases in the atmosphere has been well documented, and there is evidence that suggests an impact of this increase on the earth's climate. Agriculture is vulnerable to climatic changes, and estimating the likely response to such changes is critical. The current work examines the impact of climate change on water stress during the critical periods of soybean [Glycine max (L.) merr.] reproductive development. This is a time of particular interest because soybeans at these stages are believed to be particularly vulnerable to water stress. Climate scenarios from three General Circulation Models (GCMs) were adapted to produce daily, simulated weather datasets for the nine climate centroids (in the state of Iowa). The GCMs were the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) models. Soil association datasets were created for two counties within each of the centroids. Simulations were performed for each county and each GCM at climate samples corresponding to climate change at 350,450,550, and 650 ppm atmospheric [CO2], using the mechanistic soybean physiology model GLYCIM. The model provided data on the probability and magnitude of water stress during the reproductive development stages of soybean crops. The results indicated that water stress was most severe during the R2-R5 stages under the UKMO scenarios, and became progressively more severe as climate change progressed. Although stress occurred under the GISS and GFDL scenarios, it did not increase with changing climate. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The present study is an exploration of the similarities and differences between results from 22 character weighting schemes when applied to a study of barbet and toucan (traditional arian families Capitonidae and Ramphastidae) phylogenetic relationships. The dataset comprises cytochrome b sequences for representatives of all toucan and Neotropical barbet genera, as well as for several genera of Paleotropical barbets. The 22 weighting schemes produced conflicting patterns of relationship among taxa, often with conflicting patterns each receiving strong bootstrap support. Use of multiple weighting schemes helped to identify the source within the dataset (codon position, transitions, transversions) of the various putative phylogenetic signals. Importantly, some phylogenetic hypotheses were consistently supported despite the wide range of weights employed. The use of phylogenetic frameworks to summarize the results of these multiple analyses proved very informative. Relationships among barbers and toucans inferred from these data support the paraphyly of the traditional Capitonidae. Additionally, these data support paraphyly of Neotropical barbets, but rather than indicating a relationship between Semnornis and toucans, as previously suggested by morphological data, most analyses indicate a basal position of Semnornis within the Neotropical radiation. The cytochrome b data also allow inference of relationships among toucans. Supported hypotheses include Ramphastos as the sister to all other toucans, a close relationship of Baillonius and Pteroglossus with these two genera as the sister group to an (Andigena, Selenidera) clade, and the latter four genera as a sister group to Aulacorhynchus.

The mixed layer from fall to winter is cooled by the net surface heat flux, the Ekman transport and the entrainment, and warmed by the horizontal heat convergence resulting from the Kuroshio heat advection. The mixed layer depth is controlled by the entrainment and the horizontal transport divergence/convergence which act to slow the mixed layer deepening from fall to early winter and then in winter deepen the mixed layer. The entrainment velocity is significantly influenced by the temperature difference between the mixed layer and the layer below. The mixed layer shift from its deep to shallow phase occurred in 1985. This shift is preceded the SST-shift in 1988 by three years, and was caused by the horizontal transport divergence anomaly. The horizontal heat COnvergence of the Kuroshio Extension caused the SST-shift in 1988, whereas its anomaly had been already positive since 1983. The delay from 1983 to 1987 can be attributed to the effects of the negative fall-SST anomaly, stronger surface heat flux and Ekman cooling and the shoaling of the mixed layer depth. It is suggested that the Kuroshio current system plays a major role in forcing the SST-shift and thus the subsequent climate regime shift. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The rps16 intron displayed low levels of variation, corroborating previous reports that the chloroplast genome of palms is highly conserved. High levels of within-individual polymorphism were identified in the ITS region, indicating that concerted evolution is not effectively homogenizing the ITS repeats. In the majority of cases, multiple clones from individuals resolved as monophyletic. However, the high levels of homoplasy in the ITS dataset, along with generally poor jackknife support for many clades, led to concerns that topologies obtained from these data might be unreliable. Nevertheless, congruence between trees based on ITS data alone and those based on rps16 intron data was high. Simultaneous analyses of both datasets yielded well-resolved topologies with high levels of jackknife support. A number of exciting groups emerged from the analyses: the African rattan clade comprising the endemic African rattan genera Laccosperma, Eremospatha, and Oncocalamus; the Lepidocaryeae-Raphia clade comprising the fan-leaved New World tribe Lepidocaryeae and the African genus Raphia; and the Asian clade comprising all Asian genera except Eugeissona. The position of Eugeissona was variable, although it did not resolve inside any of the three major clades mentioned above. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

The La Palma sediment wave field covers some 20,000 km2 of the continental slope and rise, and consists of sediment waves with wave heights of up to 70 m and wavelengths of up to 2.4 km. The wave crestlines have a complex morphology, with common bifurcation and a clear sinuosity. Waves have migrated upslope through time. Cores recovered from the wave field contain volcaniclastic turbidites interbedded with pelagic/hemipelagic layers. The wave field is interpreted as having formed beneath unconfined turbidity currents. A simple, previously published, two-layer model is applied to the waves, revealing that they formed beneath turbidity currents flowing at 10-100 cm/s-1, with a flow thickness of 60-400 m and a sediment concentration of 26-427 mg/l. The El Julan sediment wave field lies within a turbidity current channel on the southwest flank of El Hierro. The sediment waves display wave heights of about 6 m and wavelengths of up to 1.2 km. The waves are migrating upslope, and migration is most rapid in the centre of the channel where the flow velocity is highest. This wave field has been formed by channelised turbidity currents originating on the flanks of El Hierro. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The Puysegur Fault is located along Puysegur Ridge, which terminates at ca. 47\u00b0S against the continental Puysegur Bank in a complex zone of deformation called the Snares Zone. At Puysegur Trench, the Australian Plate subducts beneath Puysegur Bank and the Fiordland Massif. East of Fiordland and Puysegur Bank, the Moonlight Fault System (MFS) represents the Eocene strike-slip plate boundary. Interpretation of seafloor morphology and seismic reflection profiles acquired over Puysegur Bank and the Snares Zone allows study of the transition from intraoceanic strike-slip faulting along the Puysegur Ridge to oblique subduction at the Puysegur Trench and to better understand the genetic link between the Puysegur Fault and the MFS. Seafloor morphology is interpreted from a bathymetric dataset compiled from swath bathymetry data acquired during the 1993 Geodynz survey, and single beam echo soundings acquired by the NZ Royal Navy. The Snares Zone is the key transition zone from strike-slip faulting to subduction. It divides into three sectors, namely East, NW and SW sectors. A conspicuous 3600 m-deep trough (the Snares Trough) separates the NW and East sectors. The East sector is characterised by the NE termination of Puysegur Ridge into right-stepping en echelon ridges that accommodate a change of strike from the Puysegur Fault to the MFS. Between 48\u00b0S and 47\u00b0S, in the NW sector and the Snares Trough, a series of transpressional faults splay northward from the Puysegur Fault. Between 49\u00b050'S and 48\u00b0S, thrusts develop progressively at Puysegur Trench into a decollement. North of 48\u00b0S the Snares Trough develops between two splays of the Puysegur Fault, indicating superficial extension associated with the subsidence of Puysegur Ridge. Seismic reflection profiles and bathymetric maps show a series of transpressional faults that splay northwards across the Snares Fault, and terminate at the top of the Puysegur trench slope. Between ca. 48\u00b0S and 46\u00b030'S, the relative plate motion appears to be distributed over the Puysegur subduction zone and the strike-slip faults located on the edge of the upper plate. Conversely, north of ca. 46\u00b0S, a lack of active strike-slip faulting along the MFS and across most of Puysegur Bank indicates that the subduction in the northern part of Puysegur Trench accounts for most of the oblique convergence. Hence, active transpression in the Snares fault zone indicates that the relative PAC-AUS plate motion is transferred from strike-slip faulting along the Puysegur Fault to subduction at Puysegur Trench. The progressive transition from thrusts at Puysegur Trench and strike-slip faulting at the Puysegur Fault to oblique subduction at Puysegur Trench suggests that the subduction interface progressively developed from a western shallow splay of the Puysegur Fault. It implies that the transfer fault links the subduction interface at depth. A tectonic sliver is identified between Puysegur Trench and the Puysegur Fault. Its northwards motion relative to the Pacific Plate implies that is might collide with Puysegur Bank. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

In CF, entities are recommended to a new user based on the stated preferences of other, similar users. We describe a CF spider that collects from the Web lists of semantically related entities. These lists can then be used by existing CF algorithms by encoding them as 'pseudo-users'. Importantly, the spider can collect useful data without pre-programmed knowledge about the format of particular pages or particular sites. Instead, the CF spider uses commercial Web-search engines to find pages likely to contain lists in the domain of interest, and then applies previously proposed heuristics to extract lists from these pages. We show that data collected by this spider are nearly as effective for CF as data collected from real users, and more effective than data collected by two plausible hand-programmed spiders. In some cases, autonomously spidered data can also be combined with actual user data to improve performance.",

        "Absrtact": "In Kuwait, an arid country with a low annual average rainfall of about 115 mm, fresh ground-water lenses are found at Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish fields, in the northern part of the country. These lenses are formed due to a combination of unique conditions that include short duration, high intensity rainfall; geomorphology; and lithology that enables rapid infiltration to the underlying ground-water. Large depressions and playas, paleodrainage patterns, and catchment areas, which are necessary for the accumulation of large amounts of water during flash foods, were mapped from aerial photographs, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and digital elevation model (DEM) datasets. From historical pumping and water quality variation data acquired between 1963 and 1977, the sustainable extraction rate for Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish is estimated to be 5\u00b75 and 3\u00b75 Ml day-1, respectively. These rates are fundamental to the delicate management required to extract freshwater from the lenses and yet avoid upconing of the deeper saline water. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

We compute a confidence value for putative local solutions derived from bootstrap replicates of the original solution. In the reliable parts, the confidence neighborhood and the computed solution tend to coincide. In regions that are ill-defined by the data, the neighborhood contains additional reasonable alternatives. This offers the possibility of designing further experiments for the badly defined regions to improve the quality of the physical map.

Parsimony analyses were conducted on these data, as well as on a complementary rbcL sequence dataset assembled from the literature and the combined dataset. The atp\u03b2-rbcL spacer was notable for the high frequency of insertion-deletion mutations (indels); their distributions were coded as binary characters and included as a adjunct matrix in some of the analyses. The phylogenetic patterns derived from the spacer and rbcL data and the combined analyses, both including and excluding the indel data, concur in resolving seven major lineages corresponding to the tribes of Crayn et al. (1998, Aust. J. Bot. 46, 187-200), viz. Prionoteae, Archerieae, Oligarrheneae, Cosmelieae, Richeeae, Epacrideae, and Styphelieae. The relationships of the tribes and within Styphelieae, however, are not convincingly resolved. Minor conflicts in the positions of some taxa between the spacer and the rbcL trees are poorly supported. Among epacrids, the spacer region provided more cladistically informative characters than rbcL and resulted in trees with lower homoplasy. Further, the spacer data, when analyzed alone and when combined with rbcL, resolved several clades that could not be retrieved on rbcL data alone and provided increased support for many other relationships. The evolution of a putative three-base inversion associated with a hair-pin secondary structure in the spacer region is discussed in the light of the inferred phylogeny. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Heat capacity measurements have been performed on birch plants (Betula pendula Roth.) by use of a drop-Cp-microcalorimeter. Influence of hydration level on heat capacity was investigated. It was found that heat capacity decreased in a linear fashion with decreasing water content until a point of discontinuity was reached at a water fraction of 0.2gg-1 (grams of water per gram fresh biomass). A linear regression of the region above 0.2gg-1 gave a slope of 2.49JK-1g-1 and an intercept of 1.72JK-1g-1. It was concluded that a rough division of the water in the biomass into free and perturbed water is reflected in the heat capacity of the system and that the heat capacity in the region below 0.2gg-1 could be divided into three discrete subregions. These subregions are assumed to reflect the perturbed water state in the tissue at different levels of hydration. Further, the temperature influence on heat capacity was studied in the range between 14 and 37\u00b0C. The water fraction in these experiments was 0.75\u00b10.1gg-1. No significant difference in heat capacity values was observed.

        "Absrtact": "TNT Equivalency methods are widely used for vapour cloud explosion blast modeling. Presently, however, other types of models are available which do not have the fundamental objections TNT Equivalency models have. TNO Multi-Energy method is increasingly accepted as a more reasonable alternative to be used as a simple and practical method. Computer codes based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) like AutoReaGas, developed by TNO and Century Dynamics, could be used also in case a more rigorous analysis is required. Application of the Multi-Energy method requires knowledge of two parameters describing the explosion: a charge size and a charge strength. During the last years, research has led to an improved determination of the charge strength (i.e., the class number or source overpressure) to be chosen to apply the blast charts. A correlation has been derived relating the charge strength to a set of parameters describing the boundary conditions of the flammable cloud and the fuel in the cloud. A simple approach may not be satisfactory in all situations. The overpressure distribution inside a vapour cloud explosion is generally not homogeneous and the presence of obstructions causes directional blast propagation in the near field. A CFD approach, in which the actual situation is modeled, supplies case-specific results. An overview of the key aspects relevant to the application of the Multi-Energy method and CFD modeling is provided. Then the application of the two methods is demonstrated for an example problem involving the calculation of the explosion blast load on a structure at some distance from the explosion in an offshore platform complex.

A novel summary display is used to present the information contained in bivariate graphs in order to facilitate global visualization. Positive results were achieved through assessing the capabilities of the monitoring scheme on a nonlinear industrial process.",

        "Absrtact": "Web applications are becoming increasingly database-centric. Unfortunately, the support provided by most Web sites to explore such databases is rather primitive and is based on the traditional database metaphor of submitting an SQL query and packaging the response as an HTML page. Very often, the result set is empty or contains too many records. It is up to the user to refine the query by guessing how the query constraints must be tightened or relaxed and then go through another submit/response cycle. Furthermore, once results are displayed, typically no further exploration capabilities are offered. Web applications requiring interactive exploration of databases (e.g. e-commerce) need that the above submit/response metaphor be replaced with a continuous querying metaphor that seamlessly integrates querying with result browsing. In addition to supporting queries based on predicates on attribute values, queries based on example records should also be supported. We present techniques for supporting this metaphor and discuss their implementation in a Web-based database exploration engine.",

        "Absrtact": "A validation study of the physical based pesticide leaching model WAVE is presented. The model considers a mechanistic description of 1-D water, solute and heat transport. Linear sorption isotherms and first order degradation sub-models are used to simulate pesticide sorption and transformation. The first order degradation rates are reduced when temperature and moisture stress in the soil profile occur. The model is conceived to describe pesticide fate within rigid mineral soils. Model tests were therefore done using data collected at a sandy (Vredepeel) and a loamy soil (Weiherbach). Both field data and lysimeter data were used to evaluate the performance to describe water, bromide, ethoprophos, bentazone and isoproturon transport in soil. The evaluation procedure presented by Vanclooster et al. (Agric. Water Mgmt., Vol. 44, pp. 1-19) was completely adopted. The measured soil moisture in the sandy soil could only successfully be described after calibrating the hydraulic functions using field observed soil moisture profiles. In addition, the predicted balance terms, such as the soil water drainage, were subject to a lot of uncertainty. Bromide transport in the sandy soil was poorly described with the equilibrium solute transport model. Anomalies were also observed when simulating the transport of the inert tracer in the lysimeter at the loamy site. The fate of the weakly sorbing bentazone component was appropriately described at the Vredepeel field site. However, the retardation of the strongly sorbing ethoprophos and isoproturon components was poorly simulated. Further, the pesticide dissipation varied considerably in time, which could not be accounted for with the first order degradation model. The need for model calibration illustrates the constraints when using mechanistic models such as WAVE to predict field scale pesticide fate and transport. The adoption of a mechanistic model for registration purposes may therefore be subjected to a lot of uncertainty. In addition, processes affecting pesticide fate and transport are still poorly represented within the model. Deficiencies are related to the description of non-linear sorption, time dependent pesticide degradation, and pesticide volatilisation. Future developments with the model should therefore envisage to improve the parametrisation reduce the output uncertainty, and improve process descriptions of essential processes.

In order for these data to be useful for comparing with different computer simulations and theories of water, it is first necessary to Fourier transform them to the corresponding site-site radial distribution functions. The process of doing this is not straightforward because of the inherent systematic uncertainties in the data, which arise primarily in the case of neutron scattering, from the inelasticity or recoil effects that can distort the experimental data. In this paper, it is shown that the empirical potential structure refinement procedure, which attempts to fit a three-dimensional ensemble of water molecules to all three partial structure factors simultaneously, leads to improved reliability in the extracted radial distribution functions. There are still some uncertainties, primarily associated with the hardness of the repulsive core of the intermolecular potential, which current data are not precise enough to resolve. The derived empirical potentials show some variability associated with particular experiments. General trends can be discerned however which indicate polarisation effects may be significant when effective intermolecular potentials are used over a wide temperature and density range.

Measured variables included energy intake, total energy expenditure, resting energy expenditure, rate of change in weight, CD4 count, clinical status, appetite, and mood. Derived variables included energy balance, activity-related energy expenditure, and physical activity level. Relative contributions were assessed by linear structural modeling based on multiple regression expressing results as path coefficients for individual relationships. The primary determinant of energy balance was energy intake (r = 0.80). Total energy expenditure made a very minor contribution to energy balance (r = -0.04). Total energy expenditure was primarily determined by activity level (r = 0.91), which itself was negatively related to the presence of opportunistic infection and CD4 count. Energy intake was related to activity level (r = 0.28) and appetite (r = 0.30), which were closely interrelated (r = 0.59). Such linear structural models allow quantitative importance to be apportioned to factors determining weight change in those infected with HIV and represent a powerful tool for future metabolic studies.

Mass spectral classification models were built for carbamates and their substructures using temperature-constrained-cascade correlation networks (TC-CCNs). The carbamate classifier was applied to the mass spectral scans of a GC-MS run. The classification models were built from reference and experimental mass spectra. Different network configurations were compared that used multiple network models with single outputs and single networks with multiple outputs. A major source of variation caused by randomly partitioning the training and prediction sets was reduced by an order of magnitude by using a method of Latin-partitions. This method also furnished a precision measure for comparing classification methods. Multiple networks with single outputs generally predicted better than single networks with multiple outputs. Hierarchical single output networks achieved better than 98% classification accuracy in one study. The TC-CCN models compared favorably to the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and discriminant partial least squares (DPLS) reference methods. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Information theory provides a theoretical framework for addressing fundamental questions concerning the nature of neural codes. Harnessing its power is not straightforward, because of the differences between mathematical abstractions and laboratory reality. We describe an approach to the analysis of neural codes that seeks to identify the informative features of neural responses, rather than to estimate the information content of neural responses per se. Our analysis, applied to neurons in primary visual cortex (V1), demonstrates that the informative precision of spike times varies with the stimulus modality being represented. Contrast is represented by spike times on the shortest time scale, and different kinds of pattern information are represented on longer time scales. The interspike interval distribution has a structure that is unanticipated from the firing rate. The significance of this structure is not that it contains additional information, but rather, that it may provide a means for simple synaptic mechanisms to decode the information that is multiplexed within a spike train. Extensions of this analysis to the simultaneous responses of pairs of neurons indicate that neighboring neurons convey largely independent information, if the decoding process is sensitive to the neuron of origin and not just the average firing rate. In summary, stimulus-related information is encoded into the precise times of spikes fired by V1 neurons. Much of this information would be obscured if individual spikes were merely taken to be estimators of the firing rate. Additional information would be lost by averaging across the responses of neurons in a local population. We propose that synaptic mechanisms sensitive to interspike intervals and dendritic processing beyond simple summation exist at least in part to enable the brain to take advantage of this extra information.

        "Absrtact": "The Dorper is a hardy South African composite breed, derived from a cross between the Black-headed Persian and the Dorset Horn. Dorpers are regarded as early-maturing, and ewes lambed at an age of 1 year in one study. Age at first lambing was higher in other literature sources cited. The fertility of Dorper ewes was approximately 0.90 ewes that lambed per ewe mated, with a litter size ranging from 1.45 to 1.60. The gestation length of Dorper ewes was approximately 147 days, while they were reported to start cycling as soon as 52 days after parturition. The pre-weaning survival of Dorper lambs was cited at approximately 0.90. Overall reproduction rate of Dorpers ranged from 0.99 to 1.40 lambs weaned per ewe mated, while it exceeded 1.40 lambs weaned per ewe mated per annum under accelerated mating conditions. Dorper lambs gained from 0.24 to 0.28 kg per day under vastly different environmental conditions. When weaned early at 2-3 months of age, post-weaning gains in excess of 0.18-0.20 kg per day were recorded. At slaughter, Dorper lambs had dressing percentages of approximately 50%. Two divergent genotypes in the breed (with a hairy or a woolly fleece cover) were evaluated under natural pasture conditions. No conclusive advantage in favour of either genotype could be demonstrated as far as productive traits were concerned. It was concluded that the breed adapts well to a wide variety of environmental conditions. In view of the scarcity of estimates of genetic parameters for the breed, the maintenance and expansion of datasets suitable for this purpose should receive high priority.

Thirty-four chemical variables involving metals, volatile and phenolic compounds were determined in 39 red wines from Galicia divided into two categories: Ribeira Sacra CBO and non-Ribeira Sacra CBO. Feature selection techniques were employed to choose a set of optimally discriminating variables. Multivariate chemometric classification procedures were applied to modelling classes on the basis of the selected chemical data. The obtained results indicated good performance in terms of classification and prediction for CBO Ribeira Sacra wines in order to differentiate them from other similar wines produced in nearby geographical areas. Five key features (Fe, Li, Rb, delphinidin and epicatechin) provided sufficient information to enable classification rules to be developed for identifying wines according to their origin.

        "Absrtact": "The biogeography of living calcareous nannoplankton for the southeastern Indian Ocean offshore of Western Australia was studied by analyzing 192 filter samples collected within the upper 200 m of the ocean at 33 stations. The cell density of total nannoplankton decreased significantly in some nearshore stations along the Western Australian coast where the Leeuwin Current flows. A total of 92 taxa were identified by SEM observation from 118 of the samples, i.e. those which had common nannoplankton and allowed the distinction between upper- and lower-photic zone floras. The most abundant taxa were classified into three main groups and two independent species based on their distribution pattern. Of the latter, Umbellosphaera irregularis is common in the shallower samples in the tropics, whilst Gephyrocapsa oceanica occurs in isolated patches. Group U taxa (Discosphaera tubifera, Rhabdosphaera clavigera var. stylifera and Umbellosphaera tenuis) occur in the shallower depths of the subtropical water. Group UL taxa, which include Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericasonii, Syracosphaera spp., Umbilicosphaera hulburtiana and various other taxa whose coccospheres are covered by holococcoliths (holococcolithophores), are common in the subtropics. Group L taxa, which are composed of Florisphaera profunda. Oolithotus antillarum, Gladiolithus flabellatus and Algirosphaera oryza, are most common in the deep water. In order to clarify the mega-trends of floral variations in the upper- and lower-photic zone communities, we obtained the following two rations. The ratio of U. irregularis to groups U + UL in the upper-photic community is positively related to temperature, whereas its relationship with salinity and water density is negative. In the lower-photic community, the ratio of group L to UL varies in the nutrient-poor environments, but is consistently high in eutrophic environments. The occurrence of G. oceanica is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity and lower water density in the upper-photic community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "We applied novel modelling techniques (neural networks, tree-based models) to relate total abundance and species number of Collembola as well as abundances of dominant species to habitat characteristics and compared their predictive power with simple statistical models (multiple regression, linear regression, land-use-specific means). The data used consisted of soil biological, chemical and physical measurements in soil cores taken at 396 points distributed over a 50 x 50 m sampling grid in an agricultural landscape in southern Germany. Neural networks appeared to be most efficient in reflecting the nonlinearities of the habitat-Collembola relationships. The underlying functional relations, however, are hidden within the network connections and cannot be analyzed easily. Model trees - next in predictive power to neural networks - are much more transparent and give an explicit picture of the functional relationships. Both modelling approaches perform significantly better than traditional statistical models and decrease the mean absolute error between prediction and observation by about 16-38%. Total carbon content and measurements highly correlated with it (e.g. total nitrogen content, microbial biomass and respiration) were the most important factors influencing the Collembolan community. This is in broad agreement with existing knowledge. Apparent limitations to predicting Collembolan abundance and species number by habitat quality alone are discussed.

        "Absrtact": "Lesions in estuarine finfish are associated with a variety of organisms including parasites and bacterial, viral, and fungal infectious agents. In addition, trauma, suboptimal water quality, and other abiotic stress factors may result in the loss of homeostasis. We have observed solitary ulcerative lesions on menhaden sampled from the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, the Pamlico River, North Carolina, and the St. Johns River, Florida. Histologically, the lesions demonstrated a marked chronic inflammatory infiltrate and granulomas in response to fungal hyphae throughout large areas of exposed necrotic muscle. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria were also observed in the lesions, a common finding in ulcers of aquatic organisms. Similar observations in menhaden and other species have been described previously in the literature as ulcerative mycosis, mycotic granulomatosis, red spot disease, and epizootic ulcerative syndrome. Despite the many different known causes of fish lesions, the popular press and the scientific literature have recently emphasized Pfiesteria piscicida and other Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates (and their bioactive compounds) as the primary causative agent for finfish lesions, particularly mycotic granulomatous ulcers in Atlantic menhaden. While some laboratory data suggest that Pfiesteria may play a role in field-observed lesions, much more cause-and-effect evidence is needed to determine the importance of other risk factors, both alone or and in combination with Pfiesteria. In order to better understand the etiology of lesion initiation and progression in estuarine finfish, accurate assessments of environmental conditions collected on appropriate temporal and spatial scales, and fish morphological indicators consistent with gross and histological pathologic terminology, should be used for reporting fish lesion observations and kills. Further, this outlook will help to avoid bias and may foster a broader perspective for examining the health of estuarine systems in general. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Many pseudorank estimation methods currently in use are based on the size of the eigenvalues calculated in abstract factor analysis (AFA). The basic assumption behind these methods is that the eigenvalues, when ordered according to their size, form two distinct sets, namely the so-called primary eigenvalues, that explain the systematic variation in the data together with embedded error, and the so-called secondary eigenvalues, that consist only of noise. This paper shows that a strict separation of eigenvalues in a primary and secondary set can not be expected a priori if the noise in the data is heteroscedastic. The main conclusion is that proper data pre-treatment is required to facilitate AFA-based pseudorank estimation. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Therefore, the MBB is robust against residuals correlation. An MBB design evaluates probability distribution functions and therefore opens access to non-parametric statistical analysis of the data. It does not require sum-of-squared residuals as fitting criteria and, hence, allows data analysis that is also robust against extraneous data. The MBB will be discussed for UV-VIS spectroscopic data, where the correlation in the residuals is demonstrated by autoregression analysis.

        "Absrtact": "Several social, economic and political factors have contributed to the increasing diversity of today's workforce. In addition, in an era when organizations are continuously redesigning their work and restructuring their operations to achieve their goals with fewer resources, performing work in teams has become commonplace. These trends have increased the need for managing diverse work teams effectively. There are several existing models in the management science literature that help managers to assign employees to work groups in order to maximize the groups' diversity and hence, facilitate their effectiveness. This paper introduces a new model that recasts the problem of managing diversity in a different way: it is assumed that the population comes partitioned into 'families' with a high degree of intra-familial similarity and inter-familial dissimilarity. The objective of the assignment then is to disperse these family members as evenly into the workgroups as possible. A little known network flow problem, known as the dining problem, is used to develop an efficient algorithm to produce solutions to this new model. This is followed by a report on an experimental application of the developed model to assign Master of Business Administration students in a business school to different projects in a course. As a part of this empirical report, an attractive feature of this model is also demonstrated; namely, how to conduct sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal levels of diversity in the presence of resource constraints. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing limitations of this new model and how they may be addressed in future research on this topic. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Rare gas concentrations show large variations, from 6 X 10-5 to 1 X 10-3 mol/mol for 4He and from 3 X 10-7 to 3 X 10-5 mol/mol for 36Ar. In general, 36Ar concentrations are high compared to literature data for natural gas. CO2 and N2 concentrations are variable, ranging up to 70 and 20%, respectively. Mantle-derived He is not observed, therefore CO2 and N2 are not mantle-derived either. Hydrocarbon gas maturity is high, but accumulation efficiency is small, suggesting that early-produced hydrocarbons, including oil, were lost as well as mantle helium. This is consistent with the generally late, Pliocene, trap formation, and explains the high N2 concentrations, since N2 is the final species generated at the end of organic matter maturation. Based on \u03b413C data, CO2 originates from carbonate decomposition. Very elevated 20Ne/36Ar ratios are found, reaching a maximum of 1.3 (compared to 0.1-0.2 for air-saturated water and 0.5 for air), and these high values are related to the lowest rare gas concentrations. We suggest that this highly fractionated signature is the trace of the past presence of oil in the basin and appeared in groundwater. We propose a model where oil-water contact is followed by gas-water contact, both with Rayleigh distillation for rare gas abundance ratios, thereby generating the fractionated 20Ne/36Ar signature in groundwater first and transferring it to gas later. Assuming the gas-water contact occurred shallower than present reservoir depths, this model explains the generally high 36Ar concentrations and low CH4/36Ar ratios compared to other studies on younger basins. It thus provides a historical perspective on fluid transfer in a sedimentary basin, where a gas accumulation may have been buried to greater depth since formation. Rare gas and major element data point to mixing between two gas pulses produced successively. The very CO2-N2-rich gases are terminal products of organic matter maturation which have been trapped after important migration. This gas was followed by a more typical thermogenic gas which mixed with it. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

These shell mounds have been occupied by sedentary fisher-gatherer-hunters. Charcoal fragments retrieved from vertical profiles in the archaeological sites were examined; taxonomic determinations were based on a reference collection of charred woods and a program for computer-aided identification. Charcoal assemblages of all the studied sites present taxa from various restinga vegetation types, mangroves, xeromorphic coastal forest, and inland Atlantic Forest. The restinga ecosystem, characteristic of the Brazilian coast, is associated with sandy beach ridges; the restinga forest was much more abundant during the studied period than nowadays. The charcoal assemblages represent mainly the local vegetation; a regional reconstruction depends on the study of numerous sites. In the Cabo Frio region, open restinga taxa are more abundant in the Sambaqui do Forte, while forest elements are more important in the Sambaquis Salinas Peroano and Boca da Barra. The sites studied in the Arraial do Cabo (Sambaqui da Ponta da Cabeca) and in the Saquarema regions (Sambaquis da Pontinha and da Beirada) show that open restinga formations were locally predominant. A comparison of multivariate analysis applied to both charcoal assemblages and to phytosociological data of the extant vegetation showed a good correspondence between the charcoal spectra and the present vegetation. The high taxonomic diversity of archaeological charcoal samples and numerous fragments showing traces of decay before charring suggests that aleatory gathering of dead wood constituted the main source of firewood for fisher-gatherer-hunters populations. Condalia sp. was probably selected for cultural reasons. The only significant fluctuations on the charcoal spectra relate to the mangrove vegetation. Two relatively humid episodes (recorded from ca. 5500 to 4900/4500 and from ca. 2300 to 2000 14C yr BP), intercalated by two episodes of increased dryness with increased lagoon salinity (from ca. 4900/4500 to 2300 and from ca. 2000 to 1400 14C yr BP) were recorded in the Cabo Frio region. The changes in mangrove vegetation cannot be attributed to sea-level variations, for the three regressive and the two transgressive episodes identified for the Brazilian coast during this period are not in phase with the development of mangroves. The stability of the mainland vegetation ecosystem is probably due to the edaphic character of the coastal environments, which makes coastal formations much more resistant to climatic variations and less sensitive to climatic change. We propose that this environmental stability was a decisive factor in the maintenance of the fisher-gatherer-hunter sociocultural system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The Early Devonian Mount Buffalo granite is exposed today as an inselberg at the dissected western margin of the southeastern highlands of Victoria Australia. It dominates a block of deeply incised, Ordovician turbidites that appears structurally isolated from the surrounding highlands. By treating these highlands as an elastic plate subject to flexure or warping, previous workers have proposed that this region of the Lachlan Fold Belt has experienced a relatively simple thermotectonic and landscape evolution history following shallow-level intrusion of the granite. However, results of apatite and zircon fission-track analyses from the granite indicate the occurrence of major, previously unrecognized, episodes of: (1) heating/burial prior to ~246 Ma (Early Triassic), and prior to ~70 Ma (Late Cretaceous); and (2) rapid cooling/denudation at some time between ~246 and 220 Ma (Early to Late Triassic), and between ~70 and 50 Ma (Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary). While previous interpretations of the landscape history of the region suggest the prolonged, subaerial exposure of the granite following shallow crustal residence, our results clearly indicate this region of the Lachlan Fold Belt has experienced a dynamic post-Paleozoic history. Thus this new dataset forces a radical re-interpretation of the landscape evolution of the Mount Buffalo structural block, which has significant implications for our understanding of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic geomorphic and structural development of southeastern Australia. We therefore propose a model incorporating reactivation of wrench faults that may explain the complex thermotectonic history while accommodating the detailed observations of previous workers in this area.

We use data from 37 countries on agricultural protection and public agricultural research expenditures (PARI). The empirical results are consistent with the political economy hypotheses. The analysis suggest that structural changes in the economy have important effects on the political incentives for governments not only to subsidize or tax farmers, but also to invest in public agricultural research. Furthermore, the analysis supports the hypotheses that the impact of such structural changes on government decision-making on PARI is non-linear and conditional on other factors. Regarding the impact of political institutions, the results suggest that more democracy neither leads to more distortionary transfers (agricultural protection), nor to lower investment in public goods (PARI).

        "Absrtact": "This study aimed to develop an estimate of the incidence of all medically-treated injury by level of severity and to broadly describe the epidemiology of injury in the Australian State of Victoria in a given year. Victoria has developed a relatively comprehensive injury surveillance system. Data is currently collected by various agencies on injury deaths, hospitalisations and emergency department attendances. The method used to establish the incidence of both unintentional and intentional injury is described. Incidence figures were directly derived, or estimated from, the available Victorian health sector and Coronial data bases for three level of severity (deaths, hospitalisations and medical treatment only) and for causes of injury, age and gender groups, location of the injury event and activity at the time of injury. In 1993/1994, injuries resulted in at least 1487 deaths, 67 402 persons hospitalised and an estimated 397 160 medically-treated, non-hospitalised injured persons in Victoria. In total, over 466 000 people were injured or 10.5 persons per year for every 100 residents. Males sustain 62% of all injuries yet represent 49.5% of the population. Almost three-quarters of injury fatalities and over 60% of non-fatal injuries occur among males. Young people aged 15-24 years account for 22% of all injuries yet represent only about 16% of the Victorian population. Children (0-14 years) also suffer relatively high injury rates, although mainly less severe, while the elderly are at risk of more severe injuries. The leading cause of injury death in Victoria is suicide, followed by motor vehicle accidents, whereas falls are the leading cause of all non-fatal injury. Most injuries occur in the home (36%), areas of sport and recreation (12.5%) and transport (11.7%). They are mainly associated with leisure activities (33.1%), work (11%) and transportation (10.8%). This study demonstrates a method for the development of comprehensive injury incidence estimates. The results indicate that injuries have a significant impact on the Victorian community, health care system and economy in general. Reliable incidence data are necessary for descriptive epidemiology and provide the basis for quality of life and economic cost studies. Together this information has potential application for evidence-based strategic planning and evaluation in injury research and prevention. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Geographical information systems (GIS) are becoming an increasingly integral component of natural resource management activities worldwide. However, despite some indication that these tools are receiving attention within the aquaculture community, their deployment for spatial decision support in this domain continues to be very slow. This situation is attributable to a number of constraints including a lack of appreciation of the technology, limited understanding of GIS principles and associated methodology, and inadequate organizational commitment to ensure continuity of these spatial decision support tools. This paper analyzes these constraints in depth, and includes reviews of basic GIS terminology, methodology, case studies in aquaculture and future trends. The section on GIS terminology addresses the two fundamental types of GIS (raster and vector), and discusses aspects related to the visualization of outcomes. With regard to GIS methodology, the argument is made for close involvement of end users, subject matter specialists and analysts in all projects. A user-driven framework, which involves seven phases, to support this process is presented together with details of the degree of involvement of each category of personnel, associated activities and analytical procedures. The section on case studies reviews in considerable detail four aquaculture applications which are demonstrative of the extent to which GIS can be deployed, indicate the range in complexity of analytical methods used, provide insight into issues associated with data procurement and handling, and demonstrate the diversity of GIS packages that are available. Finally, the section on the future of GIS examines the direction in which the technology is moving, emerging trends with regard to analytical methods, and challenges that need to be addressed if GIS is to realize its full potential as a spatial decision support tool for aquaculture.

These efforts have been recognized and encouraged by bank regulators. Recently, banks have extended these efforts into the field of credit risk modeling. However, an important question for both banks and their regulators is evaluating the accuracy of a model's forecasts of credit losses, especially given the small number of available forecasts due to their typically long planning horizons. Using a panel data approach, we propose evaluation methods for credit risk models based on cross-sectional simulation. Specifically, models are evaluated not only on their forecasts over time, but also on their forecasts at a given point in time for simulated credit portfolios. Once the forecasts corresponding to these portfolios are generated, they can be evaluated using various statistical methods. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A size change after EAR, however, is the consequence of alterations of the excluded aneurysm sac volume. Objective: To assess the agreement between diameter measurements and volume measurements after endovascular aneurysm repair. Patients and methods: from 53 consecutive patients scheduled for EAR, follow-up of at least 6 months was available in 35 patients. CTA was performed on all patients at discharge, at 6 months and yearly thereafter. The resulting 113 datasets were processed on a workstation in a blinded and random order. Maximal aneurysm diameter (DMAX) was measured along the central lumen line. Total aneurysm volume was measured by manual segmentation. All measurements of an individual patient were compared with each other, resulting in 149 comparisons. The significance of individual size changes was classified based on the 95% confidence limits of the intra-observer variability, using difference-of-means analysis. DMAX changes were compared to volume changes. Results: In 37% of the comparisons, discordance was found between DMAX and volume measurements. A decrease in aneurysm size was missed using DMAX in 14% of cases and an increase in 19% of cases. Conclusion: aneurysm size changes after EAR are not noticed using maximal diameter measurements in over one-third of cases.",

        "Absrtact": "An ELISA using a recombinant 14.2kDa excretory/secretory Cooperia oncophora protein (CoES14.2 ELISA) was evaluated for estimating level of cumulative exposure to infective Cooperia larvae in first grazing season calves. Data from one experiment were used to obtain a quantitative relationship between IgG levels and cumulative exposure. That relationship was validated against data from another experimental study and from natural field studies. The latter included different pasture management strategies with or without an anthelmintic treatment. Validation involved 'predicting' cumulative exposure for the groups of calves in the latter two datasets based on observed IgG levels measured with the CoES14.2 ELISA, and subsequently comparing those 'predictions' with observed cumulative exposures. Generally, 'predicted' cumulative exposures correlated well to observed exposures (r values of 0.7-0.9). However, 'predicted' cumulative exposures underestimated observed exposures in the natural field studies. Anthelmintic treatments in some of the groups of the natural field studies reduced the 'prediction' accuracy of the CoES14.2 ELISA. This suggests that cumulative exposure in relation to IgG levels is more accurately defined by the total amount of host-parasite contact than by the cumulative number of larvae ingested. It is concluded that IgG levels measured with the CoES14.2 ELISA allow evaluating how much exposure to infection calves have experienced in the first grazing season.

ReviewPlus is capable of displaying interactive 2D and 3D graphs of raw, analyzed, and simulation code data.

On the basis of its 60 living species, Ctenomys is one of the most speciose mammalian genera and displays great chromosomal variation. In order to study the mode of speciation in Ctenomys and to evaluate the role of chromosomes in cladogenesis, it is essential to generate an accurate phylogeny of the genus. From such a phylogeny k should be possible to identify particular species lineages worthy of further study. Following the success in 1998 of Lessa and Cook in generating a phylogeny of 10, mostly Bolivian, species from mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences, we sequenced a further 18, mostly Argentinian, species. By combining our dataset with that of Lessa and Cook's we were able to confirm six species lineages within Ctenomys. These lineages correspond well to taxonomic groups suggested on the basis of morphology and biogeography. At least two of the species groups (the Boliviano-Matogrossense and Chaco) are very variable chromosomally, and are worthwhile systems to examine the possibility of chromosomal speciation. While, in general, multiple specimens of the named species did form monophyletic groups on the basis of the cytochrome b analysis, there were some exceptions. Thus, C. bergi and C. yolandae did not form separate clades in the phylogenetic analysis, nor did C. roigi and C. dorbignyi. The molecular analysis was also very informative with regards species designations for C. boliviensis and related forms. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.",

Population genetics theory predicts that species relationships will be revealed with greater probability when the topology of gene trees from many unlinked loci are found to be congruent. The theory underlying this approach is described. Monophyly of the mangabeys is not supported by any of the gene trees; instead, they are polyphyletic with Cercocebus found to be the sister taxon to Mandrillus in five gene trees (with no conflicting trees), and Lophocebus found to be closely related to Papio and/or Theropithecus in all trees. Theropithecus and Papio are not strongly supported as sister taxa (present in one or two trees only); Lophocebus and Papio are supported as sister taxa in the majority of trees. A close relationship between Mandrillus and Papio is not supported in any of the trees. The relationships among Papio, Lophocebus, and Theropithecus cannot be resolved by congruence, probably due to the short time interval estimated between their divergences. The mtDNA COII sequences are used to estimate divergence dates within the papionins. The internode between the divergences of these species is estimated to be between 290 ka and 370 ka. Lastly, the evolution of morphological features such as long faces, suborbital facial fossae, and terrestrial skeletal adaptations is discussed.",

Speaker tracking is used to segment waveforms for speaker detection, which is carried out by averaging frame scores of the Viterbi path and normalizing for handset variation via a novel parameter interpolation extension of HNORM for use with waveform segments of arbitrary lengths. A short-duration penalty to augment the acoustic scores is also introduced via a nonlinear combination function.

We show that a pattern of decreasing diversity with increasing latitude characterizes both the North and South Atlantic. This pattern is confirmed for the northern hemisphere by independent data from the west-central North Atlantic and the Arctic basin. Species diversity in the North Atlantic northwards from the equator is variable until a sharp fall in the Norwegian Sea (ca. 65 \u00b0N). In the South Atlantic species diversity drops from a maximum in latitudes less than 30 \u00b0S and then decreases slightly from 40 to 70 \u00b0S. For any given latitude, North Atlantic diversity is generally lower than in the South Atlantic. Both ecological and historical factors related to food supply are invoked to explain the formation and maintenance of the latitudinal gradient of deep-sea benthic foraminiferal species diversity. The gradient formed some 36 million years ago when global climatic cooling led to seasonally fluctuating food supply in higher latitudes.",

Single-path inversions of 230 Rayleigh waveforms from 140 earthquakes mainly located in the Solomon Trench confirm the presence of an extremely thick crust, with an average depth to the Mohorovicic discontinuity of 33 km. The thickest crusts (38 km) are found in the southcentral part of the plateau, around 2\u00b0S, 157\u00b0E. Lesser values remaining much thicker than average oceanic crust (15-26 km) are found on either side of the main structure, suggesting that the OJP spills over into the Lyra Basin to the west. Such thick crustal structures are consistent with formation of the plateau at the Pacific-Phoenix ridge at 121 Ma, while its easternmost part may have formed later (90 Ma) on more mature lithosphere. Single-path inversions also reveal a strongly developed low-velocity zone at asthenospheric depths in the mantle. A three-dimensional tomographic inversion resolves a low-velocity root of the OJP extending as deep as 300 km, with shear velocity deficiencies of ~5%, suggesting the presence of a keel, dragged along with the plateau as the latter moves as part of the drift of the Pacific plate over the mantle.",

        "Absrtact": "The Western Gneiss Region (WGR) marks the outcrop of a composite terrane consisting of variably re-worked Proterozoic basement and parautochthonous or autochthonous cover units. The WGR exhibits a gross structural, petrographic and thermobarometric zonation from southeast to northwest, reflecting an increasing intensity of Scandian (late Palaeozoic) metamorphic and structural imprint. Scandian-aged eclogites have been widely (though for kinetic reasons not invariably) stabilised in metabasic rocks but have suffered varying degrees of retrogression during exhumation. In the region between the Jostedal mountains and Nordjord, eclogites commonly have distinctively prograde-zoned garnets with amphibolite or epidote-amphibolite facies solid inclusions suites and lack any evidence for stability of coesite (high pressure [HP] eclogites). In the south of this area, in Sunnfjord, eclogites locally contain glaucophane as an inclusion or matrix phase. North of Nordfjord, eclogites mostly lack prograde zoning and evidence for coesite, either as relics as relics or replacive polycrystalline quartz, is present in both eclogites (ultrahigh pressure [UHP] eclogites) and, rarely, gneisses. Coesite or polycrystalline quartz after coesite has now been found in eight new localities, including one close to a microdiamond-bearing gneiss. These new discoveries suggest that, by a conservative estimate, the UHP terrane, in the WGR covers a coastal strip of about 5000 km2 between outer Nordfjord and Moldefjord. A 'mixed HP/UHP zone' containing both HP and UHP eclogites is confirmed by our observations, and is extended a further 40 km east along Nordfjord. Thermobarometry on phengite-bearing eclogites has been used to quantify the regional distribution of pressure (P) and temperature (T) across the WGR. Overall, a scenario emerges where P and T progressively increase from 500\u00b0C and 16 kbar in Sunnfjord to > 800\u00b0C and 32 kbar in outer Moldefjord, respectively, in line with the distribution of eclogite petrographic features. Results are usually consistent with the silica polymorph present or inferred. The P-T conditions define a linear array in the P-T plane with a slope of roughly 5\u00b0C/km, with averages for petrographic groups lying along the trend according to their geographic distribution from SE to NW, hence defining a clear field gradient. This P-T gradient might be used to support the frequently postulated model for northwesterly subduction of the WGC as a coherent body. However, the WGC is clearly a composite edifice built from several tectonic units. Furthermore, the mixed HP/UHP zone seems to mark a step in the regional P gradient, indicating a possible tectonic break and tectonic juxtaposition of the HP and UHP units. Lack of other clear evidence for a tectonic break in the mixed zone dicatates caution in this interpretation, and we cannot discount the possibility that the mixed zone is, at least, partly a result of kinetic operating near the HP-UHP transition. Overall, if the WGC has been subducted during the Scandian orogeny, it has retained its general fown-slab pattern of P and T in spite of any disruption during exhumation. Garnetiferous peridotites derived from subcontinental lithospheric mantle may be restricted to the UHP terrane and appear to decorate basement-cover contacts in many cases. P-T conditions calculated from previously published data for both relict (Proterozoic lithospheric mantle?) porphyroclast assemblages and Scandian (subduction-related?) neoblastic assemblages do not define such a clear field gradient, but probably record a combination of their pre-orogenic P-T record with Scandian re-working during and after subduction entrainment. A crude linear array in the P-T plane defined by peridotite samples may be, in part, an artifact of errors in the geobarometric methods. A spatial association of mantle-derived peridotites with the UHP terrane and with basement-cover contacts is consistent with a hypothesis for entrainment of at least some of them as 'foreign' fragments into a crustal UHP terrane during subduction of the Baltic continental margin to depths of > 100 km, and encourages a more mobilistic view of the assembly of the WGC from its component lithotectonic elements.

Such paradigms are therefore potentially useful in investigating the neural bases of control functions. Here, we present the results of an fMRI study intended to examine two separable components of task-switching: preparation, and the residual shift cost identified by Rogers and Monsell [13]. In analyses restricted to functionally identified regions of interest, we found robust evidence of greater activity for switch trials, compared to repeat trials. This pattern was present both at the time of stimulus presentation and prior to the switch trial. In analyses of the entire brain, we were able to identify one area in the superior parietal lobule that was active during switching but was not part of the apparent network of task-related regions. We conclude that switch trials are neurally distinct from repeat trials in eliciting generally greater neural activity both before and during the performance of a trial.

In a Monte Carlo simulation study, we evaluated the performance of all three NN methods with that of Cox regression models which included main effects and interactions, when interactions exist. Using the EPILOG PLUS PROC NEURAL utility, feed-forward back-propagation networks were examined under nine designs representing a variety of experimental conditions which varied (a) the number of inputs and interactions, (b) the degree of censoring, (c) proportional vs. non-proportional hazards, and (d) sample size. Minimization methods were implemented that efficiently determined optimal parameters. The C-index was used as a measure of performance. For the testing phase of the study, none of the NN methods outperformed Cox regression. Compared to Cox regression, the Faraggi-Simon, Buckley-James, and Liestol-Andersen-Andersen methods performed as well as Cox regression for 7,5 and 1 of the nine designs, respectively. The effect on performance of modeling interactions in Cox regression, varying the number of intervals in the Liestol-Andersen-Andersen method, and varying the NN architecture are also presented. The results of our study suggest that NNs can serve as effective methods for modeling right-censored data. However, the performance of the NN is somewhat variable, depending on the underlying data structure.",

Repeatabilities between tests at 6-month intervals were 0.75-0.77 for gaits and 0.38-0.58 for jumping traits. The genetic correlation between the gaits ranged from 0.30 to 0.71. Positive genetic correlations were found between gaits under rider and jumping traits (0.14-0,54), thus breeding for both characteristics is facilitated. Free jumping results were highly correlated (0.93) to results in jumping under rider, and because of their higher heritability the former are Very suitable for selection purposes. Genetic correlation estimates between a trait in SPT and the same trait at 4-year-old offspring field test were unity for gaits under rider and jumping. The genetic correlations between gaits and jumping at the two different tests were 0.26-0.35. It was concluded that the field tests are well suited for early progeny testing of the stallions, and will improve the accuracy in selection of stallions for performance traits.

Field significance was assessed using a bootstrap methodology to account for the observed regional cross-correlation of streamflows. Using a 5% significance level, we found no evidence of trends in flood flows but did find evidence of upward trends in low flows at the larger scale in the Midwest and at the smaller scale in the Ohio, the north central and the upper Midwest regions. A dramatically different interpretation would have been achieved if regional cross-correlation had been ignored. In that case, statistically significant trends would have been found in all but two of the low flow analyses and in two-thirds of the flood flow analyses. We show that the cross-correlation of flow records dramatically reduces the effective number of samples available for trend assessment. We also found that low flow time series exhibit significant temporal persistence. Even when the serial correlation was removed from the time series, significant trends in low flow series were apparent, though the number of significant trends decreased. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Residual feed intake (RFI(Reg)) was calculated for each test as the difference between actual feed and expected feed intake predicted from a multiple regression of feed intake on metabolic mid-test LW and average daily gain (ADG). RFI(Reg) was heritable (0.16, S.E. 0.08) and phenotypically and genetically independent of size and growth rate. RFI(Reg) had favourable phenotypic and genetic correlations with feed conversion ratio (FCR) and estimated maintenance energy expenditure. It was negatively correlated with estimated lean content of the carcase (LEAN) and appeared to be genetically independent of mature cow LW (COWWT). RFI(Reg) over the performance test was not affected by differences in pre-test rearing treatments, in contrast to start-of-test LW and end-of-test LW, and in some years, ADG and FCR. Selection against RFI has the potential to increase the efficiency of beef production by reducing feed intake without changing the growth rate of the young animal, or increasing mature cow size.

        "Absrtact": "It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976-77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10-15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965-1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone. \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Growth of many bubbles is monitored in every experiment. Bubble growth rate increases with temperature and initial total H 2 O. At a given temperature and initial total H 2 O, bubble growth rate also increases slightly with bubble size. The average growth rate for bubbles growing in an infinite rhyolitic melt at a bubble radius of 25 \u03bcm is at 600\u00b0C and 2.0 wt% H 2 O(t,i). Our data show that bubble growth is controlled by both viscous flow and diffusion, with viscous flow playing a dominant role at the initial stage. We used the numerical bubble growth model of Proussevitch and Sahagian [J. Geophys. Res. 103 (1998) 18223-18251] to calculate bubble growth rate. Using recently assessed solubility, diffusivity, and viscosity models, the bubble growth model can reproduce our experimental data to within a factor of about 2. Adjusting the viscosity model by a factor of up to 5 (within the stated 2\u03c3 uncertainty of a factor of 8.3) generates almost perfect fits to our data. (Adjusting other parameters within uncertainty does not help significantly.) Other recent bubble growth data, except those at 0.1 MPa and 375-460\u00b0C with 5.0 wt% initial H 2 O, are also consistent with the calculation. This is the first experimental verification of a bubble growth model in a silicate melt. We suggest that the verified model can be applied with confidence to quantify bubble growth during volcanic eruptions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Several countries within the EU have successfully eradicated bovine herpesvirus type I (BHV1), while others are still making efforts to eradicate the virus. Reintroduction of the virus into BHV1-free areas can lead to major outbreaks - thereby causing severe economic losses. To give decision-makers more insight into the risk and economic consequences of BHV1 reintroduction and into the effectiveness of various control strategies, we developed the simulation model InterIBR. InterIBR is a dynamic model that takes into account risk and uncertainty and the geographic location of individual farms. Simulation of a BHV1-outbreak in the Netherlands starts with introduction of the virus on a predefined farm type, after which both within-farm and between-farm transmission are simulated. Monitoring and control measures are implemented to simulate detection of the infection and subsequent control. Economic consequences included in this study are related to losses due to infection and costs of control. In the simulated basic control strategy, dairy farms are monitored by monthly bulk-milk tests and miscellaneous farms are monitored by half-yearly serological tests. After detection, movement-control measures apply, animal contacts are traced and neighbour farms are put on surveillance. Given current assumptions on transmission dynamics, we conclude that a strategy with either rapid removal or vaccination of infected cattle does not reduce the number of infected farms compared to this basic strategy - but will cost more to control. Farm type with first introduction of BHV1 has a considerable impact on the expected number of secondarily infected farms and total costs. To limit the number of infected farms and total costs due to outbreaks, we suggest intensifying the monitoring program on farms with a high frequency of cattle trade, and monthly bulk-milk testing on dairy farms.

Measurements were made during dry westerlies on 10 occasions during 1995. The concentration and flux of salt in the air was measured using 'salt vanes'. It is concluded that marine salt is transported along the whole transect at all occasions and that the concentration and flux of salt decrease with downwind distance from the coast as an inversed power function. The two easternmost stations show a slight increase towards the east-coast. Variability of the data is high on the west coast due to strong influence from the coastal production of aerosols. This effect diminishes along downwind forming lower, less variable concentration further inland. Statistical models based on the data are in relatively good agreement with previous models and data. Further, salt content on Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris, L) needles after two westerly gale occasions, in profiles from west- to east-coast, were analysed. The Cl-/Na+, Ca2+/Na+, K+/Na+, Mg2+/Na+ and SO4 2-/Na+ ratios were studied revealing a clear downwind decrease in Ca2+/Na+ and Mg2+/Na+, a close to sea water ratio for Cl-/Na+ and an excess of SO4 2- along the profile. Also, the importance of degree of exposure was studied concluding that the roughness of the upwind surface is an important factor for the deposition onto trees in forest edges.",

A numerical solute transport simulator, that incorporates rate-limited dissolution and desorption using linear driving force expressions, was developed and applied to analyze soil column dissolution data and to conduct numerical dissolution experiments. Published mass transfer coefficients were unable to accurately predict the observed dissolution of entrapped PCE in fractional wettability porous media (media containing both water- and PCE-wet solid surfaces). A two-parameter power function expression for the lumped mass transfer coefficient was developed and successfully fit to these data. Correlations were then developed for the fitted mass transfer model parameters as a function of wettability and grain size distribution characteristics. The power function model, in conjunction with the parameter correlations, yielded reasonable predictions for long-term dissolution behavior in the more PCE- wetting media. Poorer predictions for the more water-wet materials were attributed to an increased sensitivity of effluent concentration behavior to temporal changes in PCE saturation in these systems. Many of the effluent concentration curves exhibited low and persistent concentration tailing after recovery of the separate phase PCE. This tailing behavior could be adequately modeled by incorporation of rate-limited desorption. Results from numerical experiments indicate that both the magnitude and spatial distribution of wettability can significantly influence PCE dissolution behavior and remediation time.

Although biomedical interests tend to focus on mammalian genes, only simple organisms allow rapid genetic manipulation and functional analysis. A prerequisite for the meaningful extrapolation of gene functional studies from invertebrates to man is that the orthologs under study are unambiguously linked. However, identifying orthologs is not trivial, especially where large gene families are involved. We present here an automated sequence analysis procedure that allows a rapid visualization of most likely ortholog pairs. We illustrate the utility of this approach for the human gene family of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as compared with the full set of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster conceptual ORFs. The approach is based on a reciprocal series of BLAST searches, which are automatically stored and represented in an HTML-formatted table. We have used this 'MetaBlast' approach to compile lists of human PTPs and their worm and fly orthologs. Many of these PTP orthologs had not been previously identified as such.

We have applied the method to partially rigid, C-and D-ring modified lignan natural product derivatives related to podophyllotoxin, and the biological activities of these as measured against HT29, P388 and A549 cell lines. The modified CoMFA produces more robust regressions than 'standard' CoMFA.

Interferometric SAR ice surface velocities show how three radar transects are aligned along the general direction of ice flow. Internal layering within the ice sheet is used to determine changes in the vertical component of ice flow along the transects. These data indicate ice sheet flow is related strongly to subglacial topography. In one transect, ice flows in a conventional base-parallel manner down a relatively uniform subglacial slope in the direction of ice flow. In the other two transects, internal layers show the flow of ice over a large subglacial hill upstream of Lake Vostok. Across the stoss face of this subglacial hill, analysis of the radar reflections from internal layers show that layers of ice with a preferred crystal orientation are likely to develop. This process results in layers of ice with a preferred crystal fabric across Lake Vostok at ice depths greater than ~ 2.8 km. Evidence to support our analysis comes from the Vostok ice core where layers of ice with noticeable crystal alignment are abundant at ice depths greater than 2.7 km. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We find that SO2 emission rates, measured by COSPEC, correlate with the amplitude of these tilt cycles, and that higher rates of SO2 emission were associated with stronger ground deformation and enhanced hybrid seismicity. Within tilt cycles, degassing peaks coincide with maximum deformation gradients. Increases in the amount of gas in the magma conduit feeding the dome, probably due to increases in volatile content of ascending magma volume can account for the observed increases in tilt amplitude, hybrid seismicity and SO2 emission rate.

Twice-yearly samples of different age-groups of trout were recorded, together with a more detailed set of records for a further 8 years. These data are used to develop and calibrate a time-dependent population model. A concurrent record of rainfall data for Windermere is aggregated to form seasonal averages and used as an indicator of drought for the region. Drought conditions result in lower than expected stock which can be identified as outliers from the Ricker stock-recruitment curves for each sample. A set of five difference equations, which describe the overlapping trout age-groups, is identified and used to forecast the trout population up to a few years ahead. The model is particularly successful at forecasting population numbers 1-year ahead if the following years drought is taken into account. Incorporation of drought effects into the model significantly improves model forecasts. A linearised stability analysis suggests that long-term drought conditions will have the effect of increasing population stability, although a particularly severe drought, or series of severe droughts, may lead to population decline.

It also examines the locations and occupations of jobs taken by residents of other parts of Belfast and Northern Ireland as part of the wider context. These data are used as a background for the discussion of the spatial targeting of jobs to areas of social deprivation and high unemployment. Although policies of this kind are increasingly important in Northern Ireland and in other parts of the UK, the analysis highlights two important problems. First, the well-known problem of 'spatial leakage' means that not all jobs located in deprived areas, particularly those in professional occupations, go to local residents. Secondly, residents of socially deprived areas have a greater representation in non-professional occupations in comparison with those who live in non-deprived locations. The implications of these findings are twofold. First, spatial units for labour market interventions might be more appropriately delimited to take account of observed travel-to-work flows. Secondly, to maximize job uptake by local residents of deprived areas, the jobs located there might be 'appropriate' in terms of existing occupational structures of the residents. However, this second recommendation might reinforce existing spatial and occupational divisions in the labour market since socially deprived areas could become, in a worst-case scenario, 'sinks' for low-grade employment. Because of this potential danger, supply-side education and training measures are also appropriate, as a supplement to job location policies, to enable residents of deprived locales to compete for a wider range of jobs wherever they are located. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

METHODS: Pachymetry, tonometry, and endothelial cell density were measured by a masked observer in 19 subjects with bilateral glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were treated with 2% dorzolamide in one eye, and with saline in the other, before wearing contact lenses under patched eyes. Corneal thickness, measured each 30 minutes up to 4.5 hours after contact lens removal, enabled estimation of percentage recovery per hour and time for 95% of corneal thickness recovery for both eyes. Seven patients repeated this test after 1 year of dorzolamide use, and their results were compared with those of the preceding year. RESULTS: After induction of hypoxic corneal edema, there was no significant difference between paired corneas in swelling levels (60.0 \u00b1 11.8 and 59.8 \u00b1 12.9 \u03bcm) (P = .94), time to 95% recovery (440.6 \u00b1 255.8 and 445.4 \u00b1 186.7 minutes) (P = .93), and percentage recovery per hour (38.1% \u00b1 10.9% and 36.1% \u00b1 9.6%) (P = .40). Subjects followed up after 1 year of dorzolamide use did not differ significantly in values of endothelial cell density, percentage recovery per hour, or time to 95% recovery from those obtained a year before. One subject developed persistent corneal edema after his stress test in the eye treated with dorzolamide. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the recovery from induced corneal edema after either a short-term or 1-year use of dorzolamide in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a normal corneal endothelium. One patient had persistent corneal edema after the stress test was performed on the dorzolamide-treated eye. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "In April and May 1996, a geophysical study of the Cascadia continental margin off Oregon and Washington was carried out aboard the German RV Sonne as a cooperative experiment between GEOMAR, the USGS and COAS. Offshore central Oregon, which is the subject of this study, the experiment involved the collection of wide-angle refraction and reflection data along three profiles across the continental margin using ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and hydrophones (OBH) as well as land recorders. Two-dimensional modelling of the travel times provides a detailed velocity structure beneath these profiles. The subducting oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca plate can be traced from the trench to its position some 10 km landward of the coastline. At the coastline, the Moho has a depth of 30 km. The dip of the plate changes from 1.5\u00b0 westward of the trench to about 6.5\u00b0 below the accretionary complex and to about 16\u00b0 further eastward below the coast. The backstop forming western edge of the Siletz terrane, an oceanic plateau that was accreted to North America about 50 Ma ago, is well defined by the observations. It is located about 60 km to the east of the deformation front and has a seaward dip of 40\u00b0. At its seaward edge, the base of the Siletz terrane seems to be in contact with the subducting oceanic crust implying that sediments are unlikely to be subducted to greater depths. The upper oceanic crust is thinner to the east of this contact than to the west. At depths greater than 18 km, the top of the oceanic crust is the origin of pre-critical reflections observable in several land recordings and in the data of one ocean bottom instrument. These reflections are most likely caused by fluids that are released from the oceanic crust by metamorphic facies transition. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Maize and cowpea were grown as sole stands or in agroforestry systems containing grevillea trees (Grevillea robusta A. Cunn.). Crop and system performance were examined over a 4.5-year-period (nine growing seasons) commencing in October 1991; failure of the rains caused the loss of one cropping season. A rotation of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) and maize (Zea mays L.) was grown during the first five seasons after planting the trees, while maize was grown continuously during the final four seasons. Sole maize was also grown under spectrally neutral shade netting which reduced incident radiation by 25, 50 or 75% to establish the relative importance of shade and below-ground competition for water and nutrients in determining the performance of understorey crops. The above-ground biomass and grain yield of understorey crops were not significantly affected by the presence of grevillea during the first four seasons, but were greatly reduced in subsequent seasons as the trees became increasingly dominant; maize yields reached 50% of the sole crop values only once during the final four seasons, when rainfall was unusually high. The hypothesis that competition for water was the primary limiting factor for understorey crops was supported by the observation that above-ground biomass and grain yield were greater in the shade net treatments than in agroforestry maize, demonstrating that shade was not solely responsible for the substantial yield losses in the latter treatment. Performance ratios (ratio of values for the agroforestry system relative to sole stands) for total above-ground and trunk biomass in grevillea were initially low, reflecting the impact of competition with associated crops during tree establishment, but increased to unity within 2.5 years. Performance ratios for the understorey crops exhibited the reverse trend, initially being close to unity but approaching zero for three of the final four seasons. Performance ratios were never close to unity for both trees and crops during the same season, indicating that there was always competition for available resources irrespective of crop species or tree size. The implications for agroforestry system design and future research are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Piston core MD95-2024 from the Labrador Rise provides a continuous record of rapidly deposited detrital layers denoting Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) instability. The core also provides a high-resolution record of geomagnetic paleointensity, that is consistent with, but at higher temporal resolution than previous Labrador Sea records. Correlation to the Greenland Summit ice cores (GRIP/GISP2) is achieved by assuming that Labrador Sea detrital layers correspond to cold stadials in the ice cores. This allows a GISP2 official chronology to be placed on MD95-2024 which is consistent with the inverse correlation between paleointensity and the flux of cosmogenic isotopes (10Be and 36Cl) in Greenland ice cores. Synchronous millennial scale variability observed from the MD95-2024 paleointensity record and a North Atlantic paleointensity stack (NAPIS-75) [C. Laj et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Ser. A 358 (2000) 1009-1025], independently placed on the GISP2 official chronology [C. Kissel et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 171 (1999) 489-502], further support the sediment to ice core correlation. High-resolution paleointensity and oxygen isotope records from the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, Somali Basin, sub-Antarctic South Atlantic and the relative flux of 10Be in Vostok (Antarctic) ice core are used to derive a common chronostratigraphy that neither violates the regional (millennial) or global (orbital) scale environmental stratigraphics. The resulting correlation circuit places the ice core and marine records on a common GISP2 official chronology, which indicates discrepancies as high as 5 kyr between the GISP2 and SPECMAP time scales. It further demonstrates that LIS instabilities in the Hudson Strait area are synchronous with cooling in the Greenland Summit ice cores and warming in the sub-Antarctic South Atlantic and in the Vostok ice core. Geomagnetic field intensity shows common global variance at millennial time scales which, in view of the out-of-phase interhemispheric climate variability, cannot be attributed to climatic contamination of the paleointensity records.

        "Absrtact": "Signal peptides direct mature peptides to their appropriate cellular location, after which they are cleaved off. Very many random alternatives can serve the same function. Of all coding sequences, therefore, signal peptides might come closest to being neutrally evolving. Here we consider this issue by examining the molecular evolution of 76 mouse-rat orthologues, each with defined signal peptides. Although they do evolve rapidly, they evolve about half as fast as neutral sequences. This indicates that a substantial proportion of mutations must be under stabilizing selection. A few putative signal sequences lack a hydrophobic core and these tend to be more slowly evolving than others, indicating even stronger stabilizing selection. However, closer scrutiny suggests that some of these represent mis- annotations in GenBank. It is also likely that some of the substitutions are not neutral. We find, for example, that the rate of protein evolution correlates with that of the mature peptide. This may be a result of compensatory evolution. We also find that signal peptides of immune genes tend to be faster evolving than the average, which suggests an association with antagonistic co-evolution. Previous reports also indicated that the signal peptide of the imprinted gene, Igf2r, is also unusually fast evolving. This, it was hypothesized, might also be indicative of antagonistic co- evolution. Comparison of Igf2r's signal peptide evolution shows that, although it is not an outlier, its rate of evolution is comparable to that of many of the faster evolving immune system signal sequences and 5/6 of the amino acid changes do not conserve hydrophobicity. This is at least suggestive that there is something unusual about Igf2r's signal sequence. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Frequent degassing explosions, occurring at intervals of minutes to tens of minutes, are common at many active basaltic and andesitic volcanoes worldwide. In August 1997, April 1998, and September 1998 we recorded seismic and acoustic signals generated at two andesitic volcanoes with 'Strombolian-type' activity. Despite variations in explosion frequency (5-15 h-1 at Karymsky as opposed to 1-3 h-1 at Sangay), the signatures of the explosions are remarkably similar at these two, diverse field sites. In all explosions, gas emission begins rapidly and is correlated with an impulsive acoustic pressure pulse. Seismic waveforms are emergent and begin 1-2 s before the explosion. We classify explosion events at the two volcanoes as either short-duration (less than 1 min) simple impulses or long-duration (up to 5 min) tremor events. Many tremor events have harmonic frequency spectra and correspond to regular 1 s acoustic pulses, often audible, that sound like chugging from a locomotive. Chugging events are intermittent, suggesting that the geometry or geochemistry of the process is variable over short time scales. We attribute the 1 Hz periodic chugs to a resonant phenomenon in the upper section of the conduit. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are direction-specific acoustic filters formed by the head, the pinnae and the ear canals. They can be used to assess acoustical cues available for sound localization and to construct virtual auditory environments. We measured the HRTFs of three anesthetized Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 591 locations in the frontal hemisphere ranging from -90\u00b0(left) to 90\u00b0(right) in azimuth and -60\u00b0(down) to 90\u00b0(up) in elevation for frequencies between 0.5 and 15 kHz. Acoustic validation of the HRTFs shows good agreement between free field and virtual sound sources. Monaural spectra exhibit deep notches at frequencies above 9 kHz, providing putative cues for elevation discrimination. Interaural level differences (ILDs) and interaural time differences (ITDs) generally vary monotonically with azimuth between 0.5 and 8 kHz, suggesting that these two cues can be used to discriminate azimuthal position. Comparison with published subsets of HRTFs from squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) shows good agreement. Comparison with published human HRTFs from the frontal hemisphere demonstrates overall similarity in the patterns of ILD and ITD, suggesting that the Rhesus monkey is a good acoustic model for these two sound localization cues in humans. Finally, the measured ITDs in the horizontal plane agree well between -40\u00b0and 40\u00b0in azimuth with those calculated from a spherical head model with a radius of 52 mm, one-half the interaural distance of the monkey.

        "Absrtact": "Protein synthesis in eukaryotes is mediated by both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound ribosomes. During the co-translational translocation of secretory and membrane proteins, eukaryotic ribosomes dock with the protein conducting channel of the endoplasmic reticulum. An understanding of these processes will require the detailed structure of a eukaryotic ribosome. To this end, we have compared the three-dimensional structures of yeast and rabbit ribosomes at 24 \u00c5 resolution. In general, we find that the active sites for protein synthesis and translocation have been highly conserved. It is interesting that a channel was visualized in the neck of the small subunit whose entrance is formed by a deep groove. By analogy with the prokaryotic small subunit, this channel may provide a conserved portal through which mRNA is threaded into the decoding center. In addition, both the small and large subunits are built around a dense tubular network. Our analysis further suggests that the nascent chain exit tunnel and the docking surface for the endoplasmic reticulum channel are formed by this network. We surmise that many of these features correspond to rRNA, based on biochemical and structural data. Ribosomal function is critically dependent on the specific association of small and large subunits. Our analysis of eukaryotic ribosomes reveals four conserved inter-subunit bridges with a geometry similar to that found in prokaryotes. In particular, a double-bridge connects the small subunit platform with the interface canyon on the large subunit. Moreover, a novel bridge is formed between the platform and the base of the L1 domain. Finally, size differences between mammalian and yeast large subunit rRNAs have been correlated with five expansion segments that form two large spines and three extended fingers. Overall, we find that expansion segments within the large subunit rRNA have been incorporated at positions distinct from the active sites for protein synthesis and translocation.

        "Absrtact": "We have developed a procedure to predict the peptide binding specificity of an SH3 domain from its sequence. The procedure utilizes information extracted from position-specific contacts derived from six SH3/peptide or SH3/protein complexes of known structure. The framework of SH3/peptide contacts defined on the structure of the complexes is used to build a residue-residue interaction database derived from ligands obtained by panning peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage. The SH3-specific interaction database is a multidimensional array containing frequencies of position-specific contacts. As input, SH3-SPOT requires the sequence of an SH3 domain and of a query decapeptide ligand. The array, that we call the SH3-specific matrix, is then used to evaluate the probability that the peptide would bind the given SH3 domain. This procedure is fast enough to be applied to the entire protein sequence database. Panning experiments were performed to search putative specific ligands of different SH3 domains in a database of decapeptides, or in a database of protein sequences. The procedure ranked some of the natural partners of interaction of a number of SH3 domains among the best ligands of the ~5.6 x 109 different decapeptides in the SWISSPROT database. We expect the predictive power of the method to increase with the enrichment of the SH3-specific matrix by interaction data derived from new complex structures or from the characterization of new ligands. The procedure was developed using the SH3 domain family as test case but its application can easily be extended to other families of protein domains (such as, SH2, MHC, EH, PDZ, etc.).

        "Absrtact": "The bioluminescence of Amphipholis squamata was assessed from freshly collected individuals for 16 successive months, and from individuals maintained in the laboratory under various experimental conditions of salinity, temperature and photoperiodic regime. Field investigations showed that bioluminescence intensity and kinetics varied seasonally, with the light produced being brighter and faster in winter and summer. The seasonal variation was not correlated with changes of ambient salinity. However, it was correlated with changes in temperature, the luminescence being brighter and faster in coldest and warmest seasons, and with the changes of photoperiod, the luminescence being brighter and faster in seasons with shortest and longest day length. Laboratory investigations also demonstrated that luminescence was not affected by salinity conditions. Conversely, luminescence was affected by temperature, the light production being brighter and faster in warmer conditions (in agreement with field observations) and dimmer and slower in colder conditions (in disagreement with field observations). Light production was also affected by photoperiod since experimental changes of natural light:dark regime caused the bioluminescence to decrease. Considering that photoperiod guides the biology of A. squamata and that reproduction takes place during coldest months in the species, an endogenous factor of neurophysiological nature linked to the ophiuroid reproductive cycle is proposed to induce the luminescence to peak in winter. This was confirmed by the fact that seasonal variation of luminescence was different between adult and juveniles, the latter showing no winter peak of luminescence. It is suggested that the luminescence normally associated with defense could also be part of an intraspecific visual signal related to individuals aggregating for reproduction during winter.

However, we have recently demonstrated that a monomeric motor domain construct of KIF1A (C351), a kinesin superfamily protein, moves processively, taking about 700 steps before being detached from microtubules. To elucidate the mechanism of its single-headed processivity, we examined the C351-MT interaction by mutant analysis and high-resolution cryo-EM. Mutant analysis indicated the importance of a highly positively charged loop, the 'K loop,' for such processivity. A 15 \u00c5 resolution structure unambiguously docked with the available atomic models revealed 'K loop' as an extra microtubule-binding domain specific to KIF1A, and bound to the C terminus of tubulin. The site- specific crosslinking further confirmed this model.",

FMSI: a FORTRAN program for inverting fault/slickenside and earthquake focal mechanism data to obtain the regional stress tensor. Comput. Geosci. 16, 953-989) to fault plane solutions of 298 small earthquakes (2.5<M(d)<4.8) recorded by the National seismic network of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica in the period 1988-1995. First, we verified that the stress inversion procedure, generally applied to a large number of focal mechanisms of earthquakes recorded in a local seismic network, could be successfully used in Italy, using background seismicity recorded over large (~ 100-200 km) regions. Then, comparing the stress inversion results with other stress indicators, we find that they are geologically sound for many regions in Italy, even if the misfit values are relatively large. We also find that the largest misfit values are determined by a few earthquakes (only 10-20% of the total number). Excluding these earthquakes from inversion, the average misfit becomes much lower (by ~ 30-40%). The results obtained in this study confirm the large variations of the stress field over a relatively short distance in Italy, but also confirm the existence of regions extending for a few hundred kilometres within which the stress is homogeneous. Among these, most of the Apennines are dominated by extension perpendicular to the trend of the mountain belt. Only in the northern Apennines is there any clear distinction between an area of extension in the inner portion of the belt and an area under horizontal compression along the Adriatic margin of the belt. More rapid variations occur around Calabria and Sicily, as expected because of the complexities linked with the Tyrrhenian subduction and with active volcanism. In the Ionian Calabrian coastal region, there are hints of active NW-SE compression, although constrained by a few data, whereas in the Messina Strait, we observe ~ E-W extension and a vertical \u03c31. In northern and western Sicily, our results indicate N-S to NW-SE compression, roughly consistent with the general convergence between the European and the African plates.

        "Absrtact": "This paper introduces a new reaction model for the rapid devolatilization of diverse forms of biomass called bio-FLASHCHAIN (bio-FC). Given the proximate and ultimate analyses and the thermal history and pressure, bio-FC predicts the complete distribution of primary devolatilization products from paper and any form of wood, grass, and agricultural residue, including the yields of tar and all major gas species, the elemental compositions of tars and chars, and the molecular weight distribution of tar. Biomass is represented as a chain copolymer of cellulose and a lignin-like component. The actual composition and structure of cellulose are implemented, whereas the composition of the lignin-like component is assigned from the ultimate analysis of the whole biomass. The reaction scheme is based on the depolymerization of a mixture of chain macromolecules into fragments that volatilize into tar, partially decompose into gases, or recombine with the nascent char matrix. Comparisons to measurements demonstrate that bio-FC is a macromolecular reaction framework that can represent the complete distribution of primary devolatilization products from biomass. They also suggest that the model predictions will express the impact of variations in the most important operating conditions. The novel calibration procedure for the impact of mineral catalysis does not incorporate detailed mineralogical analyses or measured product yields. But many more evaluations are necessary to establish that it is suitable for the complete range of biomass fuel properties.",

Additions to SPM2 include incorporation of major understory species, addition of site water balance components, and replacing the daily time-step decomposition and growth respiration fluxes with hourly outputs. The model extensions are intended to increase generality and to provide output that can be directly compared with eddy covariance measurements. Sensitivity analysis was performed using a Latin Hypercube sampling scheme with parameter ranges of 1-5% around the nominal values. The Latin Hypercube method divides the range of each input parameter into equal probability class intervals. This approach ensures that the entire range of each parameter will be evenly sampled and the distribution of each parameter will be better represented with fewer samples. Of the 69 parameters tested, 29 contributed 5% or more to model output variable sensitivity. Foliage mass parameters affected 16 output variables, including gas exchange quantities and tree biomass variables. Sampling parameters at the \u00b15% level resulted in only one additional parameter (initial soil water content) influencing output above the threshold value of 5%. Simulated annual net pine canopy assimilation was 1236 g C m-2, annual pine maintenance respiration was 523 g C m-2, and pine growth respiration was 91 g m-2. Annual understory assimilation was 14% of the pine value SPM2 simulations of all combinations of a range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations from pre-industrial to 750 ppm, temperature increases of 0-5\u00b0C, and precipitation changes of \u00b140% were used to generate response surfaces for the model. Although there was a positive annual stem increment at all combinations of conditions tested, the labile carbon pool (starch and soluble sugars) was completely depleted by the end of the simulated year under many combinations of increased temperature and reduced or normal precipitation.",

First, we operate an integrated urban model (TRANUS), which represents both land and travel markets with zones and networks. The travel and land use projections from TRANUS are outlined, to demonstrate the general reasonableness of the results, as this is the first application of a market-based urban model in the US. Second, the land use projections for each of the 58 zones in the urban model were fed into a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based land allocation model, which spatially allocates the several land uses within each zone according to simple accessibility rules. While neither model is new, this is one of the first attempts to link these two types of models for regional policy assessments. Other integrated urban models may be linked to other GIS land allocation models in this fashion. Pairing these two types of models allows the user to gain the advantages of the urban models, which represent spatial competition across a region and produce measures of user welfare (traveler and locator surplus), and the advantages of the GIS land allocation models, which produce detailed land use maps that can then be used for environmental impact assessment.",

It has been argued that animals in general might perform Levy flight motion with power law distribution of times between successive changes of the direction of motion. Here we study the temporal behaviour of nesting gilts. The time spent by a gilt in a given form of activity has a power law probability distribution without a finite average. Further analysis reveals intermittent occurrence of certain periodic behavioural sequences which are responsible for the scaling behaviour and indicates the existence of a critical state. This is in close analogy with temporal sequences of velocity found in turbulent flows, where random and regular sequences alternate and form an intermittent sequence. The source of this complex behaviour can come only from the neural system forced by hormonal stimulus due to nesting instincts. This is the first carefully examined case, where complex scaling behaviour of animals is related to the self-organization and possibly to some unstable critical state of the nervous system.",

        "Absrtact": "Any change in climate will have implications for climate-sensitive systems such as agriculture, forestry, and some other natural resources. With respect to agriculture, changes in solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation will produce changes in crop yields, crop mix, cropping systems, scheduling of field operations, grain moisture content at harvest, and hence, on the economics of agriculture including changes in farm profitability. Such issues are addressed for 10 representative agricultural areas across the midwestern Great Lakes region, a five-state area including Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This region is one of the most productive and important agricultural regions in the world, with over 61% of the land use devoted to agriculture. Individual crop growth processes are affected differently by climate change. A seasonal rise in temperature will increase the developmental rate of the crop, resulting in an earlier harvest. Heat stress may result in negative effects on crop production. Conversely, increased rainfall in drier areas may allow the photosynthetic rate of the crop to increase, resulting in higher yields. Properly validated crop simulation models can be used to combine the environmental effects on crop physiological processes and to evaluate the consequences of such influences. With existing hybrids, an overall pattern of decreasing crop production under scenarios of climate change was found, due primarily to intense heat during the main growth period. However, the results changed with the hybrid of maize (Zea mays L.) being grown and the specific location in the study region. In general, crops grown in sites in northern states had increased yields under climate change, with those grown in sites in the southern states of the region having decreased yields under climate change. Yields from long-season maize increased significantly in the northern part of the study region under future climate change. Across the study region, long-season maize performed most successfully under future climate scenarios compared to current yields, followed by medium-season and then short-season varieties. This analysis highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to changed environmental conditions. In addition, scenarios of increased climate variability produced diverse yields on a year-to-year basis and had increased risk of a low yield. Results indicate that potential future adaptations to climate change for maize yields would require either increased tolerance of maximum summer temperatures in existing maize varieties or a change in the maize varieties grown.

        "Absrtact": "Thermal imaging from satellites is one methodology used for the monitoring and scientific investigation of volcanoes, including those characterised by active lava domes. To be most effective, the remote sensing techniques employed must allow the cause of any observed thermal anomaly to be identified, ideally using information contained within the remote sensing data itself, whilst using any ancillary field data to guide analysis and the necessary assumptions. This study investigates a method by which such discrimination maybe accomplished for activity at lava domes. For this purpose we use three Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of Unzen Volcano (Japan) to determine the temperature structure of the active lava dome existing during 1991-1993. These data are of particularly high quality since the TM scenes were obtained during night-time overpasses and a large amount of supplementary data are available to parameterise the model used to retrieve the subpixel temperature structure of the dome surface. The results are matched to near-contemporaneous geological sketch maps of the then current situation in order to identify the TM pixel groupings corresponding to the different styles of dome activity, namely fumarolic degassing, exogenous and endogenous dome growth, and collapse deposits resulting from block and ash flows, small scale pyroclastic flows and rockfalls. The spatial and statistical characteristics of the resultant TM-derived temperature distributions are then investigated to determine rule-based criteria that may be used to differentiate the activity styles of lava domes based on their thermal structure within the remote sensing data. Results indicate that fumarolically active locations, regions of active dome growth, and areas of collapse deposition on the Unzen dome can be differentiated using only the statistical distribution of the hotspot temperatures and fractional areas identified via analysis of TM imagery. The statistics derived for hotspots at the fumarolically active areas show them to be, in general, significantly hotter (and smaller) than those found at the areas of active dome growth, whereas hotspots retrieved on the areas of collapse deposition are cooler (and larger). We find that the frequency distributions of hotspot temperatures extracted for the areas of endogenous and exogenous dome growth exhibit statistically inseparable means, but that discrimination between these two dome growth styles is possible using analysis of the spatial arrangement of the retrieved hotspots. Specifically the exogenous lobes are characterised by structures interpreted to be the effusing vent of new magma and the collapsing lobe front. These features are absent at locations showing only endogenous growth. It is hoped that the criteria developed here will prove useful during future quantitative analysis of the extended TM time-series available for Unzen, and for identification of thermal anomalies of uncertain origin at other active domes observed via satellite remote sensing. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Data about the stratigraphical and regional distribution of Cretaceous rudist bivalves in the central-eastern Mediterranean and Middle East from the Barremian to the Maastrichtian have been compiled in a taxonomic databank system. The investigated region comprises northern, central and southern regions of the Cretaceous Tethys. The regionally different quality of taxonomic data is critically discussed. Both species richness and abundance (number of species records) peak in the Early Aptian, Late Cenomanian and Early Campanian. Temporal patterns in species richness are examined in relation to evolutionary innovations of the group. Crises in species richness and abundance during the Early and mid-Cretaceous were coeval with oceanic anoxia associated with platform drowning. Also, regional emergence affected large parts of the Apulian Plate and other central Tethyan carbonate platforms during the mid-Cretaceous period of globally high sea level, so that these crises can be attributed to regional environmental perturbations, induced by either oceanic anoxia or tectonic movements. The Cenomanian-Turonian transition marks an important faunal turnover, as indicated by the demise of taxonomic groups which are characterised by recumbent ecological morphotypes and predominantly aragonitic shells. During the Turonian, they were replaced by associations of largely calcitic Radiolitidae and Hippuritidae, among which elevator morphotypes dominated. The stratigraphy of many post-Turonian deposits in the studied region is too imprecise for a detailed analysis of Late Cretaceous distributional patterns, and the demise of rudists during the Maastrichtian in particular. The regional pattern of species richness and abundance is similar throughout most of the investigated region. A notable exception is the broad north-eastern African shelf from Libya to Lebanon, where rudists were almost completely absent after the Coniacian. This coincided with shallow-water phosphorite and black-shale formation on the extended shelf of this region, indicating the upwelling of nutrient-rich waters and stagnant conditions. During this time (Campanian-Maastrichtian), species-rich associations thrived along the north-eastern Afro-Arabian margin, now exposed in south-eastern Turkey, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. This region forms the single distinct faunal province during the Cretaceous in the studied region, as indicated by an endemism of 40% at the genus level. The low species richness and abundance of Hippuritidae on Turonian-Maastrichtian central Tethyan carbonate platforms, when compared with regions having mixed calcareous-siliciclastic sedimentation, is interpreted to argue against a widespread photosymbiosis in the group. Several aspects of this study highlight the importance of regional tectonic and oceanographic controls of distributional, and perhaps also evolutionary, patterns of rudist bivalves. Their delineation still suffers from the regionally different quality of stratigraphical and taxonomic data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Basin-scale variations in oceanic physical variables are thought to organize patterns of biological response across the Pacific Ocean over decadal time scales. Different physical mechanisms can be responsible for the diverse basin-scale patterns of sea-surface temperature (SST), mixed-layer depth, thermocline depth, and horizontal currents, although they are linked in various ways. In light of various theories and observations, we interpret observed basinwide patterns of decadal-scale variations in upper-ocean temperatures. Evidence so far indicates that large-scale perturbations of the Aleutian Low generate temperature anomalies in the central and eastern North Pacific through the combined action of net surface heat flux, turbulent mixing and Ekman advection. The surface-forced temperature anomalies in the central North Pacific subduct and propagate southwestwards in the ocean thermocline to the subtropics but apparently do not reach the equator. The large-scale Ekman pumping resulting from changes of the Aleutian Low forces western-intensified thermocline depth anomalies that are approximately consistent with Sverdrup theory. These thermocline changes are associated with SST anomalies in the Kuroshio/Oyashio Extension that are of the same sign as those in the central North Pacific, but lagged by several years. The physics of the possible feedback from the SST anomalies to the Aleutian Low, which might close a coupled ocean-atmosphere mode of decadal variability, is poorly understood and is an area of active research. The possible responses of North Pacific Ocean ecosystems to these complicated physical patterns is summarized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Legitimate genotype frequency estimation for multiallelic loci relies on component allele frequencies, as population surveys represent only a fraction of possible DNA profiles. Multilocus genotypes from two ethnic human populations, African American (n = 195) and U.S. Caucasian (n = 200), were compiled at 13 STR loci that are used worldwide in forensic investigation (D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D16S539, TH01, TPOX, CSF1PO, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820). Sex-specific AmpFlSTR(TM) multiplexes provided stringent PCR-based STR typing specifically optimized for multicolor fluorescence detection. Heterozygosity at each STR locus ranged from 0.57 to 0.89 and encompassed from seven (TH01) to twenty-one (D21S11) alleles. Homozygosity tests, tests based on the distinct numbers of observed homozygous and heterozygous classes, log likelihood ratio tests, and exact tests assessed that the degree of divergence from theoretical Hardy-Weinberg proportions for all 13 STRs does not have practical consequence in genotype frequency estimation. Departures from linkage equilibrium, between loci, that imposed significance to forensic calculations were not indicated by observed variance of the number of heterozygous loci or Karlin interclass correlation tests. For forensic casework, reliable multilocus profile estimates may be obtained from the product of component genotype frequencies, each calculated through application of the Hardy-Weinberg equation to population database allele frequency estimates reported here. The average probability that two randomly selected, unrelated individuals possess an identical thirteen-locus DNA profile was one in 1.8 x 1015 African Americans and one in 3.8 x 1014 U.S. Caucasians.

New technologies have advanced our ability to address these issues but the solutions may require the commitment of resources that may yet be outside the reach of developing countries. This paper briefly reviews new and existing technologies in the areas of data collection methods with some emphasis on remote sensing methods. An example for a conceptual data base management system adapted by the US Department of Agriculture is presented as a framework for the acquisition, maintenance and distribution of climate and agrometeorological data for the 21st century. The access of data to the national and international community can be resolved with the standardization of data base management and electronic accessibility. Databases in the US have been upgraded for access through the World Wide Web, and include data archived from other countries that have co-operative programs with US institutions. The operational needs of national agricultural producers, researchers, and agricultural weather and crop forecasters are the focus of this paper although it also serves some of the needs of the international research community.

The TPR1 domain of Hop specifically recognizes the C-terminal heptapeptide of Hsp70 while the TPR2A domain binds the C-terminal pentapeptide of Hsp90. Both sequences end with the motif EEVD. The crystal structures of the TPR-peptide complexes show the peptides in an extended conformation, spanning a groove in the TPR domains. Peptide binding is mediated by electrostatic interactions with the EEVD motif, with the C-terminal aspartate acting as a two-carboxylate anchor, and by hydrophobic interactions with residues upstream of EEVD. The hydrophobic contacts with the peptide are critical for specificity. These results explain how TPR domains participate in the ordered assembly of Hsp70-Hsp90 multichaperone complexes.",

        "Absrtact": "Integrated geophysical surveys were performed in two sites, Fossa di Fuardo and Terme di San Calogero in Lipari Island, Southern Italy with the intent of the exploration of low-enthalpy geothermal fluids. Both sites show strong geochemical and geologic evidences of hydrothermal activity. The geophysical methods consist of two microgravimetric surveys, two 2D geoelectric profiles, a seismic reflection profile and a five seismic refraction profiles. The seismic methods allowed us to locate the main subsurface seismic discontinuities and to evaluate their geometrical relationships. The gravity field was used to constraint the seismic discontinuities, while the electric prospecting let discriminate more conductive areas, which could correspond to an increase in thermal fluid circulation in the investigated sites. The results obtained by the different geophysical methods are in good agreement and permit the definition of a reliable geostructural model of the subsurface setting of the two investigated areas. A low-enthalpy geothermal reservoir constituted by a permeable pyroclastic and lava sequence underlying two shallow impermeable formations was found at Fossa del Fuardo. The reservoir is intersected by some sub-vertical faults/fractures that probably play an important role in convoying the thermal water up to the surface. At the other site, Terme di S. Calogero, the geophysical surveys showed that an intense circulation of fluids affects the subsurface of the area. This circulation concentrates along a ENE-trending fault located at a little distance from the thermal resort. The hot fluids may upraise along the fault if the width of the ascent area is smaller than 20 m. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Several robust nonparametric location estimators are examined with respect to several criteria, with emphasis on the criterion that they should agree with the point of symmetry in the case of a symmetric distribution. For this purpose, a broad version of multidimensional symmetry is introduced, namely \"halfspace symmetry\", generalizing the well-known notions of \"central\" and \"angular\" symmetry. Characterizations of these symmetry notions are established, permitting their properties and interrelations to be illuminated. The particular location measures considered consist of several nonparametric notions of multidimensional median: The \"L2\" (or \"spatial\"), \"Tukey/Donoho halfspace\", \"projection\", and \"Liu simplicial\" medians, all of which are robust in the sense of nonzero breakdown point. It is established that the first three of these in general do identify the point of symmetry when it exists, whereas the latter, however, fails to do so in some circumstances. Combining this finding with consideration of other criteria such as affine equivariance, stochastic order preserving, and degree of robustness, we conclude that among these choices, the \"halfspace\" and \"projection\" medians, both of which are based on projection pursuit methodology, are the most attractive overall. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "This paper is devoted to a new approach to the problem of estimating the free core nutation (FCN) parameters from tidal gravity data. We first review different models of the FCN resonance parameters (period, damping, strength), as well as different inversion techniques used in gravimetry (analytical, linearised least squares, non-linear generalised inverse, stochastic). We propose then a new Bayesian inversion method since such a probabilistic view allows the most complete and reliable information on the FCN resonance to be obtained. We show the consequences of introducing the positivity of the quality factor Q and, even more important, we show that the null information criterion on this factor allows us to better understand why Q is often underestimated in gravity studies (or even found to be negative) with standard least squares techniques. We apply the Bayesian estimation method to a set of gravity data originating from a 3000-day record (1988-1996) of the superconducting gravimeter (SG T005) near Strasbourg (France), after correction for pressure effects and ocean loading with the help of a recent model derived from satellite altimetry. The marginal distribution found for the eigenperiod is nearly Gaussian and leads to a most probable value of 428 days, in agreement with previous gravity studies. The Q distribution is found to be highly asymmetrical with a flat maximum probability that Q exceeds 105, in agreement with the high values derived from very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) studies. The joint probability laws of the parameters show that strong correlations exist between some couples of parameters. Finally, the important impact of inaccurate ocean loading corrections on the determination of the damping of the eigenmode is pointed out; it appears that wrong ocean corrections may lead to underestimation of Q or, even worse, to generation of negative Q when using standard least squares retrieval techniques applied to gravity data.",

        "Absrtact": "Plant communities (ground and field layer species) within a wide range of coniferous forest stands across Britain were classified using the National Vegetation Classification, and community composition and diversity related to stand structure and site characteristics. Data were collected from 12 plantation forest sites, encompassing a range of climatic conditions (uplands, foothills, and lowlands), crop types (Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Corsican pine), and crop ages (pre-thicket, mid-rotation, mature and over-mature). Vegetation communities in lowland sites were poorly correlated with semi-natural woodland analogues, with 'goodness-of-fit' coefficients less than 40%. The highest coefficients were obtained for mature and over-mature pine and spruce stands in the uplands and foothills climatic zones. These stands were matched most closely to semi-natural pinewoods and oakwood communities. Principal components analysis produced four summary soil vectors and four habitat structure vectors, that described 84 and 79% of the variability in the site and stand structure data, respectively. These vectors were related to plant community composition, species richness and diversity using canonical correspondence analysis and correlation analysis. Variation in community composition was related principally to a soil fertility gradient, defined by increasing pH, exchangeable Ca, and available N in NO3- form, coupled with decreases in soil organic matter and N in NH4+ form. Vascular plant and bryophyte species diversity was inversely related to available N. Uplands and foothills Scots pine and Sitka spruce sites had plant communities typical of acid, infertile soils, whereas lowland Norway spruce sites had communities associated with high soil fertility. Plant community composition and diversity was also significantly related to measures of vertical stand structure. Pre-thicket plots, with high values for field layer vertical cover; had distinctive communities and were more diverse than mid-rotation and mature plots; which had high canopy cover values, and low shrub and field layer cover. A positive relationship was recorded between deadwood volume and bryophyte species diversity, with over-mature Sitka spruce stands in the uplands having particularly high volumes of deadwood due to windthrow. This influence of stand structure suggests that plant community diversity can be enhanced in commercial conifer forests by extending rotation lengths, introducing alternative silvicultural systems such as shelterwood, and increasing deadwood volumes.

A limitation of this rule is basically the number of parameters of the one-fluid EoS considered, which cannot exceed 2 or 3.By integrating an improved Teja corresponding states EoS (T), which requires the same individual parameters as a cubic equation, in a gE-EoS mixing rule framework, a new technique is obtained with two modes, one correlative and one predictive.In the correlative mode, the liquid phase \u03b3 is generated from input VLE data using the improved T model and the historical Wong-Sandler-Teja mixing rules for the pseudocritical functions, except for Tcmix. In the predictive mode, the same general procedure is followed, but with the liquid phase \u03b3 coming from a UNIFAC gLE model, which makes the mixing rule predictive.The Tcmix values are locally generated from these new rules and are correlated as an individual function, which in both cases presents a very smooth trend for the systems studied. The two proposed rules are applied to systems of halogenated alkanes, which are known to be polar and deviating, and are compared with the dedicated EoS available for these mixtures. The results for both modes show an interesting level of accuracy in representing the whole thermodynamic behaviour of a mixture. Copyright \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "We have used wide-angle seismic data to constrain the internal structure of Tenerife, Canary Islands. The experiment was designed as a seismic fan profile to detect azimuthal variations in the seismic structure of the volcanic edifice and its flanks. Seismic energy was generated using a 75-1 airgun-array on board the RRS Charles Darwin fired every 40 s along a quasi-circular profile around the island of Tenerife, centered on Teide volcano. We present the results obtained from the data recorded by five portable land stations distributed on the island. The travel-times indicate that the averaged P-wave velocity within the volcanic edifice is greater than 6 km/s. The observed travel-times were reduced to residual travel-times by removing the effects of variations in the bathymetry along the profile, variations in the shot-receiver distance, and from local heterogeneities. Negative residual travel-times up to 0.8 s in amplitude indicate that the southwestern part of Tenerife is characterized by a high P-wave velocity zone, coincident with a gravity maximum that was previously modeled as a high-density body forming the core of an old, large mafic volcano. We estimate velocities greater than 7.3 km/s within the anomalous body, suggesting that it represents an intrusive plutonic complex. This high-velocity, high-density body may have played an important role in the evolution of Tenerife, buttressing Las Ca\u00f1adas edifice and preventing the occurrence of landslides in the southern and western areas of Tenerife. The bathymetric high between Tenerife and La Gomera is associated with travel-time delays up to 0.4 s, suggesting that it may be composed of large deposits of lava flows and volcaniclastic materials, probably erupted from the shield massifs of Teno, Roque del Conde, and La Gomera. The post-shield volcanic zones of Santiago and Dorsal rifts also seem to be characterized by moderate high P-wave velocities. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.",

We considered Rayleigh waves from available records of all events which occurred during years 1991-1995, with latitude lower than 40\u00b0S and magnitude M \u2265 5.0. We performed classic single-station dispersion analysis on the surface wave train to measure group velocity of the Rayleigh fundamental mode in the period range between 30 and 120 s. We iteratively applied two different techniques of filter analysis: a multiple-filter [Dziewonski et al.. 1969] and a phase-matched filter algorithm [Herrin, and Goforth. 1977]. We used such dispersion measurements to compute two-dimensional maps of velocity anomalies in the region. We parameterized group velocity with linear splines, and inverted the linear system by means of singular value decomposition. Results are in significant agreement with earlier studies, but reach a considerably higher detail. Our model differentiates well among geologically different regions, such as the old East Antarctica craton, the accreted terranes of West Antarctica, and the oceanic lithosphere surrounded by the ring of mid-ocean ridges. We image slow areas corresponding to hot-spot regions, including a broad anomaly corresponding to recent volcanism in the Ross Sea, where the existence of a mantle plume has been proposed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using morphologic and rbcL sequence characters for 20 taxa that represent the range of chromosome number, ecological and pollination system diversity in the genus. Parsimony analyses reveal that aneuploid reduction (n=5 to 4) and polyploidy (n=5 to 10) have evolved at least twice in the genus; whereas the obligately submersed growth habit and hypohydrophily have evolved once.

        "Absrtact": "Samples of both surface and subsurface soils were collected on various surfaces in three badland areas of differing ages (Tabernas, Vera and Mocatan), in Almeria province, southern Spain. Data were explored with the aim of identifying any diagnostic geochemical relationships between site EC, pH, sediment size and SAR, which might constitute typical 'signatures' for site materials, with some success. Data for the three sites are further used to explore the hypothesis that changes in site geochemistry through time are involved in badland stabilisation. It was found that: (1) the physico-chemical properties of the three sites can be differentiated by the functional relationship between EC and SAR, and this may represent a useful tool in characterising sites where piping predominates; (2) there is some (equivocal) evidence that sediment size distribution may play an additional role in site diagnosis and evolution; and (3) surfaces appear to lose sodium over time, the suggestion being that sodium is either progressively buffered by calcium during leaching, or exchanges with hydrogen on the cation exchange sites under a vegetation cover. Since other research suggests that smectite can also relocate down the profile on some marl sites, reducing hydraulic conductivity and suppressing pipes, we argue that the surface at Tabernas may be capable of long-term autostabilisation in which piping intensity progressively reduces. However, this possibility really applies only to fine-grained, densely structured materials, and evidence from the silty Triassic-rich unit in the Mocatan basin suggests that without a high clay content, piping may be expected to increase through time. From this standpoint, contemporary badland morphology at Mocatan does not represent an early stage of the forms seen in Vera and Tabernas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Atmospheric CO2 concentration has greatly fluctuated during the Quaternary. These variations have influenced the vegetation changes. The assumption that the relationship vegetation-climate sensu stricto was constant through time should be reconsidered taking into account the impact of the atmospheric CO2 content on the plants. Here we propose to use a process-based vegetation model (BIOME3) in an inverse mode to reconstruct from pollen data the most probable climate under precipitation seasonality change and under lowered CO2 concentration in the biosphere. Appropriate tools to match the model outputs with the pollen data are developed to generate a probability distribution associated with the reconstruction (Monte Carlo sampling and neural network techniques). The method is validated with modern pollen samples from Greece and Italy: it proves to be able to reconstruct modern climate with a more or less large error bar from pollen data. The error bar depends in fact on the tolerance of the vegetation to the corresponding climatic variable. The application to six pollen assemblages from Greece and Italy, representing the last glacial maximum (LGM: 18 000 14C-year B.P.), is done into three experiments: (1) modern CO2 concentration; (2) LGM CO2 concentration; (3) LGM CO2 concentration and high winter precipitation. The latter experiment is motivated by evidence of high lake-levels in Greece during the LGM which has been attributed to winter rainfall. These experiments show that winter was ca. 15-20\u00b0C colder than the present, in agreement with previous climate reconstruction. The apparent discrepancy between the high lake-levels and the steppe vegetation during the LGM, can be explained by an increase of the winter precipitation (which leads to high lake level) while the summer season is mild and dry (which affects the vegetation). The summer temperature has three stable states (- 16\u00b0C, - 10\u00b0C, - 2\u00b0C), but the warmest one is the most probable if we take into account the lowered CO2 and the high lake-levels.

The low-resolution structure of the complex is known from electron microscopy studies. The general shape of the complex is in the form of an L, with one arm in the membrane and the other peripheral. We have purified complex I from beef heart mitochondria and reconstituted the enzyme into lipid bilayers. Under different conditions, several two-dimensional crystal forms were obtained. Crystals belonging to space groups p2221 and c12 (unit cell 488 \u00c5 x 79 \u00c5) were obtained at 22\u00b0C and contained only the membrane fragment of complex I similar to hydrophobic subcomplex I\u03b2 but lacking the ND5 subunit. A crystal form with larger unit cell (534 \u00c5 x 81 \u00c5, space group c12) produced at 4\u00b0C contained both the peripheral and membrane arms of the enzyme, except that ND5 was missing. Projection maps from frozen hydrated samples were calculated for all crystal forms. By comparing two different c12 crystal forms, extra electron density in the projection map of large crystal form was assigned to the peripheral arm of the enzyme. One of the features of the map is a deep, channel-like, cleft next to peripheral arm. Comparison with available structures of the intact enzyme indicates that large hydrophobic subunit ND5 is situated at the distal end of the membrane domain. Possible locations of sub-unit ND4 and of other subunits in the membrane domain are proposed. Implications of our findings for the mechanism of proton pumping by complex I are discussed.

The ice-budget calculations are performed on a common and relatively fine grid (0.5\u00b0x 1\u00b0), by interpolating the monthly GCM fields, making straightforward corrections for the GCMs' topographic errors, and adding synthetic diurnal cycles of air temperature and solar radiation. These fields drive a common snow-ice vertical column model (LSX) through annual cycles to predict net precipitation, melt, and ablation at each fine-grid point over Greenland, Antarctica, and the 21 k Laurentide and Eurasian ice sheets. Considerable scatter among GCMs is found in the computed budgets for all ice sheets except Antarctica, even among the higher-resolution GCMs. This is mainly due to scatter in snow and ice melt around the ice-sheet margins, which is caused by differences of several degrees in summer surface-air temperatures in these regions. Wind speed and cloudiness also vary widely among GCMs, but contribute little to the scatter in melt. Although the temperature differences are not large by GCM standards, they have a large effect on melt rate. By driving a 2-D dynamic ice-sheet model with the predicted mass balances, it is shown that the scatter would cause drastic uncertainties in coupled ice-sheet/GCM simulations of long-term ice-sheet evolution. Much the same scatter occurs with a commonly used perturbative method (using present observed temperatures and precipitation, modified by the GCMs' predicted changes from the present). Although some of the scatter may be due to local differences in ice albedos between GCMs, it is argued that most of it are due to larger-scale climatic differences. Thus, the stringent requirements of consistency in ice-sheet forcing are not met by this set of GCMs, and consistent results from ice-sheet/GCM simulations of future sea-level contributions and past ice-age evolution will require improvements in GCM performance.

In this paper, we discuss the philosophy of design, functional modules and application areas of POND, a decision tool that has been developed to allow analysis of pond aquaculture facilities by the use of a combination of simulation models and enterprise budgeting. We focus less on the details of POND's internal models, and more on the experiences we have gained from going through the process of the designing, developing and using the POND software. POND was designed and implemented using object-oriented programming principles. The software makes use of a simulation framework to provide much of the generic simulation, data handling, time flow synchronization and communication features necessary for complex model-based DSSs. Additionally, an architecture suitable for representing and manipulating pond aquaculture facilities was developed in order to meet the design specifications of POND. This architecture includes a series of mini-databases, a number of knowledge-based components ('experts'), models of the pond ecosystem, and various decision support features (e.g. assembling alternate management scenarios, economic analysis, and data visualization). A typical POND simulation consists of assembling a number of appropriate objects or entities (e.g. multiple ponds and fish lots), their management settings together with appropriate experts (e.g. an aquaculture engineer, an aquatic biologist, an economist, etc.), and projecting changes in the facility over time. Our experience with the development of POND and other simulation-based tools indicates that the object-based approach provides a robust foundation for developing tools which allow code reusability, facilitate maintenance of complex software, and enable partition of program development among multiple programmers. Experience gained with POND users suggests that there are largely two groups of aquaculture personnel interested in such applications, namely commercial growers and educators. These two groups have substantially different interests and needs. Consequently, a single tool such as POND may not optimally meet the requirements of both groups. Recent development work on POND, and the need to involve users in the design process of such tools are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Episodes of enhanced ice rafted detritus (IRD) input were accompanied by discrete temperature minima, representing coolings of between 4 and 8\u00b0C, and reductions in surface salinity of up to 2.5-3.5\u2030. Several additional cooling episodes of a similar magnitude were documented during intervals of low IRD input that appear to be synchronous, within the limits of dating, with ice rafting events spatially confined to higher latitudes. Accelerator mass spectrometer 14C dates for Heinrich events (HI - 14.2 ka, H2 - 21.4 ka, H3 - 26.7 ka, H4 - 34.8 ka, H5 - 47.2 ka) obtained from core SU90-03 agree well with other published age estimates and suggest a contemporaneous pattern of climate change throughout the North Atlantic during the last glacial period. This interpretation is supported by a comparison of IRD and palaeotemperature records from DSDP site 609 and core SU90-03, which clearly shows that the major climatic fluctuations identified at high latitudes were transmitted toward the subtropics. However, 14C dates suggest that ice rafting episodes may be diachronous to some extent. The northward migration of the polar front after the H1 event at 40\u00b0N in the mid-Atlantic occurred at 14 ka, approximately 500 years earlier than along the Portuguese margin, where the southerly advection of polar waters persisted within eastern boundary current system.

Recently, it was found that one of the most abundant expressed sequence tags in Onchocerca volvulus infective larvae encoded a protein with similarities to a component of vespid venom. This clone was designated O. volvulus Activation associated Secreted Protein -1 (Ov-asp-1). We report the characterization of three members of a family of proteins, designated the Ov-ASP family, of which Ov-ASP-1 is a member. Sequence based and phylogenetic analyses suggest that these proteins form a filarial specific protein family related to both the vespid venom antigen 5 and the vertebrate CRISP/Tpx family of proteins. The three members of the Ov-ASP family exhibit distinct patterns of expression in the life cycle of O. volvulus. Genomic Southern blot analyses indicate that several genes encoding sequences related to the Ov-asp family are present in the genome of O. volvulus. Recombinant proteins expressed from full length cDNAs encoding two members of the Ov-asp family were found to induce an angiogenic response after injection into corneas of naive mice, and vessel formation was associated with only minor inflammatory cell infiltration. These data suggest that Ov-ASP proteins may directly induce an angiogenic response and may therefore contribute to corneal neovascularization in onchocercal keratitis.

        "Absrtact": "Detailed \u03b413C stratigraphies have been published recently for several Cenomanian-Turonian pelagic sections of southern England, and the Lower Saxony basin of Germany. The observed changes in the \u03b413C record provide a useful tool for high-resolution stratigraphic correlation, and are used here to create a composite Cenomanian-Turonian \u03b413C curve in a time-related framework. A best fit curve to 673 carbon isotope data is provided using the LOWESS regression scatterplot smoother. The long-term trend of the smoothed composite \u03b413C profile varies on time scales of 106 years, and shows stable \u03b413C values through the Lower Cenomanian, an increase in the Middle and Upper Cenomanian, with a major positive excursion around the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary, and a decrease through the Lower and Middle Turonian. Short-term fluctuations vary on time scales of 105 years, and dominated the \u03b413C signal in the higher Middle and Upper Turonian. Changes of the Cenomanian-Turonian \u03b413C record have commonly been explained by variations in the organic carbon flux to the sedimentary reservoir, in response to eustatic sea-level change. However, mass balance consideration suggests also an influence of carbonate production and burial rate on the \u03b413C signal. Enhanced inorganic carbon burial increased the ratio of the inorganic to organic carbon fluxes and shifted the 13C/12C ratio to more negative values. This pattern may be observed in the Early and Middle Turonian \u03b413C long-term record, and correlates with the spatial expansion of pelagic carbonate deposits in epicontinental seas. Short-term \u03b413C variations could be either a directly response to short-term sea-level changes, reflecting local conditions in the European epicontinental sea, or could represent changes in oceanic 12C storage in response to the varying intensity of thermohaline circulation.

        "Absrtact": "The length distribution of normal faults and grabens in the Valles Marineris region of Mars reveals the importance of fault linkage on fault-length data sets. Fault-length data for the normal-fault segments produce a continuously curving distribution on a cumulative-length vs. frequency plot, assuming that the faults all slip independently, with an approximate slope of -2 for lengths 30 < L < 200 km. When the Martian fault lengths are modified to account for their interaction and linkage, a more shallowly sloping (approximately -1) distribution is produced for fault lengths 30 < L < 300 km, reflecting the greater importance of large linked faults in accommodating the regional strains. Incremental-frequency and R-plots of fault lengths demonstrate variations in fault density with linkage and the importance of considering grabens as single structures. Unlike some terrestrial earthquake data, the Martian fault population does not reveal persuasive evidence for a small-to-large fault transition associated with lithospheric thickness or rheology, or with long-term strain. However, the decoupling of maximum fault displacement and length over the full range of the data is consistent with the dependence of displacement-size scaling on fault segment aspect ratio, rather than on the total fault length. The important inverse dependence of population power-law exponent and natural inhomogeneous fault strain, obtained previously from terrestrial fault sets and fault-growth simulations, is supported by using this Martian fault array.

The neural network is discriminatively trained to maximize speaker recognition performance specifically in the setting of telephone handset mismatch between training and testing. The algorithm requires neither stereo recordings of speech during training nor manual labeling of handset types either in training or testing. Results on the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Speaker Recognition Evaluation corpus show relative improvements as high as 28% for the new multilayered perceptron (MLP)-based features as compared to a standard mel-cepstral feature set with cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) and handset-dependent normalizing impostor models.",

        "Absrtact": "In order to better understand the behaviour of nickel in magmatic processes, we have measured the apparent equilibrium constant (K(D)) for the exchange of Fe and Ni between coexisting olivine and sulphide liquid at controlled oxygen and sulphur fugacities (f(O2) = 10-8 -10-10 and f(S2) = 10-2-10-4) over the temperature range 1200 to 1400\u00b0C and with 5 to 50 wt.% nickel in the sulphide liquid. Measured values of K(D) are independent of temperature and sulphur fugacity, but increase linearly with the nickel content of the sulphide liquid, and follow a power-law increase with oxygen fugacity; behaviour that is consistent with previous measurements of K(D) under controlled conditions of f(O2) and f(S2). The variation of K(D) with melt nickel content and f(O2) is most likely the result of nonideal mixing in the sulphide liquid, which results in a decrease in \u03b3(NIS)/\u03b3(FeS) with melt/sulphur ratio. As a consequence of the systematic dependence of K(D) of f(O2), a new oxygen barometer is proposed for estimating oxygen fugacity in igneous rocks that were cosaturated in olivine and sulphide liquid. Application of the experimental results to natural samples shows that the relatively large variations that exist in K(D) values from different olivine + sulphide-saturated rock suites can be interpreted as arising from variations in f(O2) and/or the nickel content of the sulphide liquid. Oxygen fugacities calculated for oceanic basalt samples using the proposed Fe-Ni exchange oxybarometer are found to be relatively high (10-8.5-10-10.4) which is in accord with the range of values determined using glass ferric/ferrous ratios. Moreover, the very low f(O2) (~10-14) calculated for the mafic dike from Disko Island is consistent with the presence of native iron in these samples and is in quantitative agreement with indicators of f(O2) based on chromite- and olivine-melt partitioning of vanadium. Consideration of the f(O2) exhibited by olivine + sulphide-saturated intrusive suites reveals a range from relatively oxidized (i.e., similar to oceanic basalts) to values at or below that of Disko Island. Field, petrographic, and geochemical evidence suggests that the production of the low f(O2) suite of samples is probably the result of reduction accompanying the assimilation of carbonaceous country rock.

        "Absrtact": "The New Jersey passive continental margin records the interaction of sequences and sea-level, although previous studies linking seismically defined sequences, borehole control, and global \u03b418O records were hindered by a seismic data gap on the inner-shelf. We describe new seismic data from the innermost New Jersey shelf that tie offshore seismic stratigraphy directly to onshore boreholes. These data link the onshore boreholes to existing seismic grids across the outer margin and to boreholes on the continental slope. Surfaces defined by age; facies, and log signature in the onshore boreholes at the base of sequences Kw2b, Kw2a, Kw1c, and Kw0 are now tied to seismic sequence boundaries m5s, m5.2s, m5.4s, and m6s, respectively, defined beneath the inner shelf. Sequence boundaries recognized in onshore boreholes and inner shelf seismic profiles apparently correlate with reflections m5, m5.2, m5.4, and m6, respectively, that were dated at slope boreholes during ODP Leg 150. We now recognize an additional sequence boundary beneath the shelf that we name m5.5s and correlate to the base of the onshore sequence Kw1b. The new seismic data image prograding Oligocene clinoforms beneath the inner shelf, consistent with the results from onshore boreholes. A land-based seismic profile crossing the Island Beach borehole reveals reflector geometries that we tie to Lower Miocene litho- and bio-facies in this borehole. These land-based seismic profiles image well-defined sequence boundaries, onlap and downlap truncations that correlate to Transgressive Systems Tracts (TST) and Highstand Systems Tracts (HST) identified in boreholes. Preliminary analysis of CH0698 data continues these system tract delineations across the inner shelf The CH0698 seismic profiles tie seismically defined sequence boundaries with sequences identified by lithiologic and paleontologic criteria. Both can now be related to global \u03b418O increases and attendant glacioeustatic lowerings. This integration of core, log, and seismic character of mid-Tertiary sediments across the width of the New Jersey margin is a major step in the long-standing effort to evaluate the impact of glaciouestasy on siliciclastic sediments of a passive continental margin.

This argument is developed by drawing on an analysis of the levels of residential population within designated risk zones around a sample of major accident hazard sites in the UK, and on examples of the consequences of ignoring population proximity in the allocation of required safety measures.

Muriwai is a high-energy meso-tidal beach characterised by modal breaker wave heights of 2.5 m and incident wave periods of 10-15 s. The monitored rip system was characterised by a 400 m long, 75 m wide longshore feeder channel and a 150 m wide rip-neck channel oriented obliquely to the shore and extending over a distance of almost 400 m. During the experiment, the beach evolved from a longshore bar-trough and rip state to a transverse bar and rip configuration. Mean eulerian flow velocities obtained from ducted flowmeters deployed on the margin of the feeder channel and rip-neck were on the order of 1 m s-1 and instantaneous flows were commonly in excess of 2 m s-1. Mean lagrangian surface flow velocities extending from the base of the feeder through to the rip-head were obtained by tracking rip floaters and were on the order of 0.7 m s-1, with maximums in the rip-neck region of 1.4 m s-1. A distinct tidal modulation of rip current flow existed with maximum velocities occurring at low tide and minimum velocities at high tide. Comparison with other rip studies suggests that although the magnitude of the morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes occurring within large-scale rip systems is extreme, the behaviour of these rip systems is very similar to low-energy rips with much smaller spatial scales. There is evidence to suggest that distinct morphodynamic scaling relationships exist between these environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

There is a need for Meteorological Office forecasts to be more readily available to the scientific community and for fine grid hydrodynamic models to be developed for regions considered to be at risk. There should be a shift in the focus of spill modelling towards real-time forecasting and away from the present emphasis on simplistic hindcasting studies. There is a need for a central forecasting service, run according to UK Meteorological Office protocols, to provide state-of-the-art forecasting at the time of a major spill.

In near-central collisions, the spectral shapes and the widths of the rapidity distributions of K- and K+ mesons are in agreement with the assumption of isotropic emission. In non-central collisions, the K- and K+ rapidity distributions are broader than expected for a single thermal source. In this case, the polar angle distributions are strongly forward-backward peaked and the nonisotropic contribution to the total yield is about one third both for K+ and K- mesons. The K-/K+ ratio is found to be about 0.03 independent of the centrality of the reaction. This value is significantly larger than predicted by microscopic transport calculations if in-Medium modifications of K mesons are neglected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Deamplification of strong motion and the increase of the effective period of soil deposits are typical nonlinear effects: we seek them in SMART 1-array data by applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) technique. The recordings, from four soil and one rock stations, represent 23 earthquakes (ML 4.9-7.0): PGA varies between 20-260 cm/s2. For each station, mean HVSR curves are calculated for two PGA ranges: <75 cm/s2 and >100 cm/s2 (weak and strong motion). At the soil station, the \"weak\" (linear) and \"strong\" (nonlinear) responses are significantly different. Below 1-1.8 Hz, the nonlinear response exceeds the linear one. Above 2 Hz, the nonlinear response drops below the linear one and above 4-6 Hz below unity (deamplification). From 10 to 16 Hz, the two responses converge. One soil site shows significant negative correlation between resonance frequency and ground acceleration. Such behaviour agrees with other empirical studies and theoretical predictions. Our results imply that the HVSR technique is sensitive to ground-motion intensity and can be used to detect and study nonlinear site response. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Historical time-series of recruitment to plaice stocks around the United Kingdom were examined for evidence of synchrony. Correlations were significant for most pair-wise comparisons and a meta-analysis test over all the stocks was highly significant. Previous studies on plaice recruitment in the North Sea have suggested that a negative relationship exists between sea temperature, during the first few months of the year, and subsequent year-class strength. When we examined the correlations between sea surface temperature and plaice recruitment, we found statistically significant negative relationships for most areas. These were strongest for the period February-June. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the temperature effect on recruitment of North Sea plaice is due to changes in predation pressure on the planktonic stages. However, western (North Sea and Channel) and eastern (Irish Sea and Celtic Sea) stocks appeared to respond to different time-scales of temperature variability which may imply that different mechanisms could be operating in these stocks. Management of plaice is based upon projections of future stock dynamics. Compared with fisheries on some other species, those on plaice are less dependent on the in-coming year-class. Therefore, the incorporation of sea temperature data into plaice stock dynamic models will probably not have a large impact on short-term projections. However, incorporation of a temperature relationship will allow medium to long-term forecasts to be made under varying environmental scenarios. These may provide a more realistic range of projections of future stock trends than is currently achieved. Crown Copyright \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Background. Although numerous reports have documented declining mortality rates associated with coronary artery bypass surgery in recent years, it is unknown whether similar trends have occurred with valve surgery during this time. Methods. We conducted a regional, prospective study to assess trends in patient casemix and in-hospital mortality rates over time with aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and mitral valve repair. Data were collected from all patients undergoing AVR (n = 2,596), MVR (n = 759), or mitral valve repair (n = 522) in Northern New England between January 1992 and December 1997. Logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of in-hospital mortality and to calculate risk-adjusted mortality rates. Results. For AVR, the trend in patient casemix was toward increased risk with increases in patient age and in the proportion of patients with: Body surface area less than 1.7, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and prior valve surgery. A decrease was noted in the proportion of patients undergoing additional surgical procedures. For MVR, patient risk improved over the time period with fewer female patients and fewer patients with coronary artery disease. For mitral valve repair patient risk increased over the time period with increases in the proportion of patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and whose surgical priority was classified as urgent. In addition, there was a borderline significant increase in the proportion of mitral valve repair patients in New York Heart Association class IV preoperatively. Risk-adjusted mortality decreased 44% from 9.3% in 1992 through 1993 to 5.3% in 1996 through 1997 for patients undergoing AVR (p = 0.01) and decreased 53% from 13.6% in 1992 through 1993 to 8.2% in 1996 through 1997 for patients undergoing MVR (p = 0.01). We observed a statistically insignificant increase in risk-adjusted mortality over the time period for patients undergoing mitral valve repair (from 3.6% in 1992 through 1993 to 5.0% in 1996 through 1997; p = 0.34). Conclusions. Significant improvement in mortality rates with valve replacement was observed in northern New England during this time period. This improvement persisted following adjustment for changes in patient casemix over this time. These trends mirror improvements in mortality with other cardiac surgical interventions that have been observed in recent years in our region and nationally.

        "Absrtact": "The presence of erosive canyons on high latitude passive margins is unusual. Such margins are more normally dominated by subsidence and glacially influenced deposition. However, ten canyons are identified at the edge of the narrow shelf on the North Norwegian margin off the Lofoten Islands, between the Traenadjupet and Andoya slides, on the basis of GLORIA long-range side-scan sonar and contemporaneous 3.5 kHz profiler data, combined with a detailed bathymetry. The canyons are located down-stream of sediments transported through the Lofoten Drift, and the margin is characterized by an absence of cross-shelf troughs. Canyons are up to 420 m deep, U-shaped, display steep gradients in their upper parts, and sediments derived from them have short runout distances onto the continental rise. The canyons are estimated to be 20-30 Ma old, being incised into only thinly covered, lithified, pre-Miocene sediments as a response to Cenozoic uplift. Late Quaternary sedimentation processes associated with the canyons are inferred to occur during both glacials and interglacials. Glacial sedimentation is probably in the form of direct subglacial-debris input, in addition to turbid subglacial meltwater plumes. Interglacial sedimentation processes are probably dominated by the along-shelf transport of sediments by strong ocean currents; canyon heads 'capture' sediment from the shelf. The remobilization of this coarse material and erosion of the canyons occurs through debris flows and turbidity currents. Canyon preservation and continued development can be attributed directly to the comparatively low sedimentation rates during full-glacial conditions, as ice streams, located to the north and south, produce regional depocentres away from this area of relatively slow-flowing ice.

The one is a correlative concept which is characterized by all the advantages and disadvantages of statistical regression methods. It is strongly dependent on data quality. In the second study an expert knowledge system is developed. Fuzzy set theory is applied to transfer rules of landscape ecological experience to image parameters derived from satellite data.

MRA using MW, \u03b1 and \u03b2 is unsatisfactory because of collinearity amongst predictors. The best predictor was the product MW*charge.

Changes induced by dipyridamole infusion on left ventricular function in healthy individuals have not been investigated by gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging. Methods and Results. This study examined the amplitude and duration of changes induced by dipyridamole infusion on left ventricular function as assessed by technetium 99m sestamibi gated SPECT in 18 subjects with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease. Twenty mCi (740 MBq) of Tc-99m sestamibi were injected at rest. Three different consecutive gated SPECT images were performed 60 minutes later: baseline at rest, during the infusion of 0.76 mg/kg of dipyridamole, and 1 hour later. No patient received aminophylline. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), end-diastolic volume, and end-systolic volume were automically computed. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure were regularly monitored. Mean LVEF was 63.2% \u00b1 8.0% baseline at rest, increased to 73.8% \u00b1 8.2% (P = .0001) during dipyridamole infusion, and returned to baseline values (63.0% \u00b1 7.5%) 1 hour later. End-diastolic volume did not vary significantly, and end-systolic volume decreased (from 32.2 \u00b1 19.5 to 26.6 \u00b1 17.9 u, P = .002) and returned to baseline values (32.7 \u00b1 15.6 u) 1 hour later. Dipyridamole induced moderate HR acceleration (from 80.2 \u00b1 15.0 to 96.5 \u00b1 9.6 beats/min, P < .001) and a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure (from 80.6 \u00b1 8.1 to 70.1 \u00b1 9.0 mm Hg, P < .001). However, 1 hour later, HR and blood pressure had returned to baseline values. Conclusions. Dipyridamole increases LVEF and HR and decreases diastolic blood pressure slightly in healthy individuals. Because dipyridamole gated SPECT imaging acquisition is usually started 60 minutes after dipyridamole infusion, LVEF is in fact estimated at rest.",

The relationships between the two fields are revealed by canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The data sets used refer both to the period from 1911 to 1990. The most important spatial mode in MSLP fields is the NAO pattern and its corresponding principal component (PC) is closely related to the NAO index. However, it is interesting that the NAO pattern seems to be responsible only for the second EOF in precipitation while the most important spatial mode of precipitation corresponds to the third EOF of MSLP (North Sea pattern). Furthermore, the second EOF (Scandinavian pattern) of MSLP is highly associated with the third EOF in precipitation. Significant pairs of canonical correlation patterns between the MSLP fields and precipitation were obtained being coherent to the conclusions above referred. The results can be used to assess potential changes of precipitation over Europe based on variability of MSLP simulated by GCMs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Orogenic gold deposits are a widespread coherent group of epigenetic ore deposits that are sited in accretionary or collisional orogens. They formed over a large crustal-depth range from deep-seated low-salinity H2O-CO2 + CH4 + N2 ore fluids and with Au transported as thio-complexes. Regional structures provide the main control on deposit distribution. In many terranes, first-order faults or shear zones appear to have controlled regional fluid flow, with greatest ore-fluid fluxes in, and adjacent to, lower-order faults, shear zones and/or large folds. Highly competent and/or chemically reactive rocks are the most common hosts to the larger deposits. Focusing of supralithostatic ore fluids into dilatant zones appears to occur late during the evolutionary history of the host terranes, normally within D3 or D4 in a D1-D4 deformation sequence. Reactivation of suitably oriented pre-existing structures during a change in far-field stress orientation is a factor common to many deposits, and repeated reactivation may account for multiple mineralization episodes in some larger deposits. Absolute robust ages of mineralization support their late-kinematic timing, and, in general, suggest that deposits formed diachronously towards the end of the 100 to 200 m.y. long evolutionary history of hosting orogens. For example, in the Yilgarn Block, a region specifically emphasised in this study, orogenic gold deposits formed in the time interval between 40 and 90 m.y., with most about 60 to 70 m.y., after the youngest widespread basic-ultrabasic volcanism and towards the end of felsic magmatism. The late timing of orogenic gold deposits is pivotal to geologically-based exploration methodologies. This is because the present structural geometries of: (i) the deposits, (ii) the hosting goldfields, and (iii) the enclosing terranes are all essentially similar to those during gold mineralization, at least in their relative position to each other. Thus, interpretation of geological maps and cross-sections and three-dimensional models can be used to accurately simulate the physical conditions that existed at the time of ore deposition. It is particularly significant that the deposits are commonly related to repetitive and predictable geometries, such as structural heterogeneities within or adjacent to first-order structures, around rigid granitoid bodies, or in specific \"locked-up\" fold-thrust structures. Importantly, the two giant greenstone-hosted goldfields, Kalgoorlie and Timmins, show a remarkably similar geometry at the regional scale. Computer-based stress mapping and GIS-based prospectivity mapping are two computer-based quantitative methodologies that can utilize and take advantage of the late timing aspect of this deposit type to provide important geological aids in exploration, both in broad regions and more localized goldfields. Both require an accurate and consistent solid geology map, stress mapping requires knowledge of the far-field stresses during mineralization, and the empirical prospectivity mapping requires data from a significant number of known deposits in the terrane. The Kalgoorlie Terrane, in the Yilgarn Block, meets these criteria, and illustrates the potential of these methodologies in the exploration for orogenic gold deposits. Low minimum stress anomalies, interpreted to represent dilational zones during gold-related deformation, coincide well with the positions of known goldfields rather than individual gold deposits in the terrane, and there are additional as-yet unexplained anomalies. The prospectivity analysis confirms that predictable and repetitive factors controlling the siting of deposits are: (i) proximity to, and orientation and curvature of, granitoid-greenstone contacts, (ii) proximity to segments of crustal faults which strike in a preferred direction, (iii) proximity to specific lithological contacts which have similar preferred strike, (iv) proximity to anticlinal structures, and (v) the presence of preferred reactive host rocks (e.g., dolerite). The prospectivity map defines a series of anomalous areas, which broadly conform to those of the stress map (> 78% correspondence). The most prospective category on this map covers less than 0.3% of the greenstone belts and yet hosts 16% of the known deposits, which have produced > 80% of known gold. Thus, it discriminates in favour of the larger economically more-attractive deposits in the terrane. The successful application of stress mapping and prospectivity mapping to geology-based exploration for orogenic gold deposits indicates that more quantitative analysis of geological map data is a profitable line of research. The computer-based nature of these methodologies is ideal for the production of an ultimate, integrated, deposit target map, which can be compared to other, more conventional, targeting parameters such as geophysical and geochemical anomalies. Such an integrated strategy appears the way forward in the increasingly difficult task of cost-effective global exploration for orogenic gold deposits in poorly exposed terranes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The purpose of this study is deriving a 3D tomographic image of the shear-wave velocity structure of the lithosphere asthenosphere system of the Mediterranean region from Rayleigh wave fundamental mode dispersion data. The database consists of almost 200 wavetrains corresponding to regional events recorded at the MedNet very-broad-band stations placed in the Mediterranean area. On the basis of the path-averaged group velocities derived for each epicentre-station trajectory, local group velocities over the area covered by the seismic paths have been obtained for the 10-90s period range by means of Yanovskaya's formulation for laterally heterogeneous media. According to the resolution of these local velocities, a grid of 1\u00b0 of latitude per 1\u00b0 of longitude has been defined over the Mediterranean area and a local group velocity dispersion curve has been then assigned to each gridpoint. The stochastic inversion of almost 450 local dispersion curves permits deriving the respective ID shear-velocity structures, from which the elaboration of a 3D tomographic image of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system of the Mediterranean region is straightforward. As expected, taking into account the complexity of this area, the shear-velocity model reveals significant lateral changes in the crust and uppermost mantle elastic structure. As a main feature, low shear-velocities are deduced for most part of the central and eastern Mediterranean basin at shallow depths, down to 35-40 km. whereas significantly higher velocities are obtained for the basins of the western Mediterranean at this depth range. This velocity pattern suggests a thicker crust in the centraleastern part, with a greater thickness of sedimentary layers on account of the lower velocities deduced for the uppermost levels. On the contrary, for depths>80 km., low shear-velocities are obtained towards the west, while the highest shear-velocities are derived for the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Aegean Sea. Greece, the centre and the south of the Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea, Sicily and Tunisia. The velocity pattern at this depth range suggests a deeper beginning of the asthenosphere (varying between 100 and 150 km) under these areas, while a shallower top (around 70 km depth) is found beneath the western Mediterranean Sea. The areas where a thicker lithosphere has been deduced depict the main contact between the Eurasian and African plates, this feature being related to the collision and subduction processes linked to the convergence of both lithospheric plates. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Neutron diffraction studies may be used to investigate the modifications to the local molecular environment. It is found that the hydrogen bonding is enhanced in the confined state and the nucleation temperature is depressed. The diffraction studies show that there is a systematic variation in the structure factor, which is similar to that of the bulk phase but shifted in temperature. The behaviour at low temperatures is due to the formation of an extended hydrogen-bonded network similar to that of amorphous ice. The confined liquid eventually nucleates with the formation of a defective form of cubic ice rather than hexagonal ice formed in the bulk phase. The studies have been made primarily for mesoporous silicas but some preliminary results are also given for water in a lamellar liquid crystal. The results have relevance to the behaviour of interfacial water in membranes and biological systems. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Projected changes in global climate have important ramifications for the future of national parks and other reserves set aside to conserve ecological uniqueness. We explored potential implications of climatic changes on lifeform distribution and growth at Wind Cave National Park (WCNP), South Dakota, which lies on a climatically determined ecotone between grassland and forest. Fire, promoted by healthy grasslands, is a negative feedback limiting tree development because it kills seedlings and consumes live foliage thus reducing tree growth and survival. Historical records show that fire suppression has enhanced forest expansion. On the other hand, livestock grazing reduces grass biomass and fuel loads thus indirectly reducing fire frequency and enhancing the expansion of forests or woodlands. Natural fires and moderate grazing by native herbivores have maintained the coexistence of trees and grasses but climatic variations affecting the area's water resources can lead to dominance by either lifeform. We used a dynamic vegetation model (DVM) MC1 to simulate the interactions between climatic changes, natural fire regime, and grazing pressure and their impact on the biogeographical and biogeochemical characteristics of the park. We used one future climate projection (HADCM2SUL) which simulates warmer weather by the end of the next century: the temperature increase would constrain the growth of trees that rely on the availability of deep water, favor shrub and grass development and promote a shift from forests to woodlands. Woody encroachment of shrubs in grasslands areas, enhanced by grazing, was only held in check by frequent natural fires in the simulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A 10 m long sequence recovered in Basaltso comprises the entire lake history following the last glaciation of the area, probably during the Preboreal oscillation. This is indicated by a succession from glacial via glaciolimnic to limnic sediments. Deglaciation of the area was associated with a high sedimentation rate, mirrored also in the basal part of a 2.6 m long core from a smaller lake (BI) about 1 km south of Basaltso. Limnic sedimentation without glacial influence commenced about 10 000 cal. yr BP according to radiocarbon-dated terrestrial plant remains. Biogeochemical and palynological data indicate an earl Holocene climatic optimum from 9000 to 6500 cal. yr BP A climatic deterioration began at 6500 cal. yr BP with an increase in snow accumulation, documented by a change in the pollen assemblage and a coinciding change in the grain-size distribution. At least since 5000 cal. yr BP, a decrease in the biogeochemical parameters in both lake sediment successions indicates a temperature decline. This deterioration culminated at about 3000-1000 cal. yr BP, when the climate was cold and dry. A slight warming is indicated in the pollen assemblage between ca. 1000 and 800 cal. yr BP. Following a subsequent rise in precipitation, cooling during the Little Ice Age is mirrored in lowest dwarf shrub pollen percentages and in low contents of organic components.

        "Absrtact": "Gaining a good knowledge of air motion in forest vegetation is a necessary step towards a better understanding of a number major abiotic impacts on the trees such as wind risk, pollutant and nutrient deposition, frost, material dispersion and transport, and energy, water and carbon exchanges. In a recent survey study, Raupach et al. [Raupach, M.R., Finnigan, J.J., Brunet, Y., 1996. Bound.-Layer Meteorol. 78, 351-382] reviewed the current state of knowledge about air flow under ideal conditions (neutral to slightly unstable conditions, homogeneous and extensive canopy, flat terrain). This paper extends the knowledge by employing advances in our understanding of the flow in 'non-ideal' situations. The paper is divided into four topic areas: canopy flow under stable stratification, disturbed flow (forest edge, forest clearing, sparse canopy), canopy flow over complex terrain, and extreme wind events. Discussion of the latter two topics is of limited scope because of the scanty literature. A detailed account is given to the nighttime canopy wave phenomenon, broad patterns of the transitional flow across forest edges, and models of various complexities of the disturbed flows. Both observational and modeling aspects are discussed wherever possible. This synthesis study has identified a number of important questions in need of further research.

        "Absrtact": "Antarctic subglacial lakes were first identified by Robin et al. (1970) after airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) investigations of the ice-sheet interior. Recently, satellite altimetry was used to measure anomalous near-flat regions on the ice-sheet surface that represent a manifestation of the subglacial lake beneath. Using RES and satellite altimetry, the location and extent of Antarctic subglacial lakes can be identified. The largest subglacial lake exists beneath Vostok Station, and is 14,000 km2 in area. The combined area of additional subglacial lakes beneath Dome C is 15,000 km2 and at least 15,000 km2 of lake surface lies beneath the remainder of the ice sheet. The water depth of subglacial lakes can be estimated through seismic investigations (although data exist only for Lake Vostok) and consideration of the bedrock slopes that border subglacial lakes. The depths of many subglacial lakes are of the order of 10's-100's of metres. The total volume of water held beneath the ice sheet is estimated between 4000 and 12,000 km3. To date, there are six known examples of radio-echo reflections from the lake floors (at a depth of no more than 20 m). Since e/m attenuation through water is related to the salinity, these data indicate that subglacial water is very pure and fresh. Some near-flat surface regions that usually occur over lakes have been observed where no lakes exist. Such features are may be caused by water-saturated basal sediments rather than subglacial lakes. Finally, the spatial variation in geothermal heat flux around the central regions of Antarctica can be established estimated by employing a simple thermal model of the ice sheet under an assumption that the basal ice temperature above subglacial lakes is equal to the pressure melting value. Calculations indicate that the geothermal heat flux varies spatially over the Antarctic Plate between 37 and 65 mW m-2. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

A detailed description of the ForestGALES wind risk model is used to demonstrate the deterministic/probabilistic approach to risk assessment. The importance of quantitative risk estimation is illustrated by model output comparing a range of silvicultural strategies and site characteristics. The results illustrate how difficult it is to make general statements about risk and how management response has to be 'context sensitive'. Any response must be appropriate to the level of risk, the options for risk reduction and the implications of damage. Mathematical models provide an opportunity for objectively calculating the risks to forests and will in the future allow forest managers to make informed decisions about how best to manage forests in order to minimise these risks.

The ability of the learning system to express spatial relationships allows an improved predictive model to be developed, which is both parsimonious and understandable.

By using only those interaction components with the largest singular values, one can produce an estimate of interaction that requires far fewer than mn parameters while retaining most of the explanatory power of standard methods. The central inference problems of estimating the parameters and determining the number of interaction components has been difficult except in \"ideal\" situations (equal cell sizes, equal variance, etc.).

The model is empirically tested using a structural equations approach with a convenience sample of Hong Kong and U.S. taxpayers. Results indicate education has a direct, negative effect on compliance in both groups. This effect is moderated by an indirect, positive link between education, moral development, and compliance. The significant differences noted are that U.S. (Hong Kong) taxpayers used higher (lower) stages of moral reasoning, had more (less) favorable attitudes toward the tax system, and were more (less) compliant. These results suggest that efforts to increase taxpayer compliance need to be tailored to the structure of the tax system and the predominant culture of the taxpayers. \u00a9 2000 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.",

Relatively non-volatile elements such as chromium and manganese are captured with efficiencies comparable to overall particulate capture, whereas more volatile elements such as selenium and arsenic are captured less efficiently than the ash particulate. Such element-specific behavior is a consequence of the partitioning of individual trace elements within the combustion and post-combustion environment, resulting in enrichment of the more volatile compounds in the smallest ash particles, coupled to size-dependent particulate penetration through air pollution control devices. In this paper, a model of trace element emissions that incorporates fundamental laboratory results on trace element partitioning as well as recent field emissions data is developed. Model results and comparison to field data indicate that while the emissions of non-volatile elements such as chromium are currently well predicted by existing database-referenced empirical models, predictions of the emitted concentrations of volatile compounds such as arsenic and selenium can be improved by more than 25% through incorporation of element and size-dependent partitioning and penetration.",

Generalized estimates of the maternal blood-to-hair, blood-to-intake, or hair-to-intake ratios are necessary for linking exposure to biomarker-based dose-response models. Most assessments have used point estimates for these ratios; however, significant interindividual and interstudy variability has been reported. For example, a maternal ratio of 250 ppm in hair per mg/L in blood is commonly used in models, but a 1990 WHO review reports mean ratios ranging from 140 to 370 ppm per mg/L. To account for interindividual and interstudy variation in applying these ratios to risk and safety assessment, some researchers have proposed representing the ratios with probability distributions and conducting probabilistic assessments. Such assessments would allow regulators to consider the range and likelihood of mercury exposures in a population, rather than limiting the evaluation to an estimate of the average exposure or a single conservative exposure estimate. However, no consensus exists on the most appropriate distributions for representing these parameters. We discuss published reviews of blood-to-hair and blood-to-intake steady state ratios for mercury and suggest statistical approaches for combining existing datasets to form generalized probability distributions for mercury distribution ratios. Although generalized distributions may not be applicable to all populations, they allow a more informative assessment than point estimates where individual biokinetic information is unavailable. Whereas development and use of these distributions will improve existing exposure and risk models, additional efforts in data generation and model development are required. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Back-arc basin glasses from the Mariana Trough and Manus Basin display contrasting oxygen isotope characteristics that require differences in their mantle sources. In both basins, the lavas that are most depleted in high field strength elements possess \u03b418O values of around 6.0\u2030, that are elevated with respect to mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). This characteristic is consistent with a mantle source that has been infiltrated by fluids released from subducted oceanic lithosphere. The nature of the more fertile mantle component differs between the two basins. The lowest \u03b418O values in the Mariana Trough are similar to MORB and suggest that the ambient upper mantle interacts with a subduction-modified mantle to produce Mariana Trough back-arc basin basalts. Oxygen isotope ratios of basaltic glasses from the Manus Basin display a negative correlation with helium isotope ratios. The subduction-modified component is associated with 3He/4He ratios typical of the upper mantle. Glasses with 3He/4He ratios greater than average MORB, characteristic of a deep mantle plume, have \u03b418O values that are lower than expected for upper mantle melts. This suggests that the Manus Basin plume taps a reservoir that is 18O-depleted relative to the source of MORB. Two mechanisms are identified that might generate this reservoir. Deep recycling of oceanic crust that has been hydrothermally altered at high temperature may provide large 18O-depleted domains in the deep mantle. Alternatively, we propose that interactions between silicate and iron alloy during the segregation of the Earth's core may have the potential to generate such reservoirs. Resolution between these mechanisms requires further experimental investigation of oxygen partitioning between silicates and iron alloy. Each of these mechanisms has distinct implications for the origins and dynamics of the Manus Basin plume. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

We examined those relationships in a clinical setting prior to a standardized exercise test. Methods and results: Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured during 5 min of supine rest among 92 healthy men (N = 52) and women (N = 40) who had above-average cardiorespiratory fitness as indicated by peak oxygen uptake measured during grade-incremented treadmill exercise. HRV datasets were decomposed into low- frequency (LF; 0.05-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.15-0.5 Hz) components using spectral analysis. Self-ratings of trait anxiety and perceived emotional stress during the past week were also assessed. Conclusions: There was an inverse relationship between perceived emotional stress during the past week and the normalized HF component of HRV (P = 0.038). This indicates a lower cardiac vagal component of HRV among men and women who perceived more stress. That relationship was independent of age, gender, trait anxiety, and cardiorespiratory fitness. It was also independent of heart rate; mean arterial blood pressure; and respiration rate, factors which can influence HRV and might be elevated among people reporting anxiety and perceived stress. We conclude that vagal modulation of heart period appears to be sensitive to the recent experience of persistent emotional stress, regardless of a person's level of physical fitness and disposition toward experiencing anxiety.

        "Absrtact": "Since the early days of geochemical isotope ratio mass spectrometry there has always been the problem of cross contamination, i.e. the contamination of the sample gas with traces of reference gas (and vice versa) in a dual inlet system and the analyzer itself. This was attributable to valve leakages and could be corrected for. In modern leak-free machines this problem still influences the measurements by scale contraction. It limits the interlaboratory comparability to values unacceptable for, e.g. global carbon cycle investigations on atmospheric \u03b413CO2, with the need to integrate global datasets at a 0.01%, precision level. No matter what the reason of apparent cross contamination (physical leakage, low pump efficiency, gas-wall interactions), we present a method to measure the actual cross contamination as well as algorithms to correct for it. By using isotopically enriched sample gas the effect on the reference gas is directly shown. Especially for biomedical applications, employing highly enriched materials, the nonlinear correction has to be applied. A long-time record of two machines shows the influence of vacuum breakage and the inlet system setup. We present a survey of cross contamination in some of the frequently used machines. The relatively poor raw results of two recent interlaboratory comparison experiments are explained in terms of cross contamination. Whereas the linear two-point normalization procedure considered by itself may be appropriate for some routine applications at natural isotope abundances, it always relies on relative \u03b4 values of two reference materials. There is an urgent need to establish absolute values for all scale-determining reference materials. We recommend the use of cross contamination measurements to at least determine the isotopic composition of all normalization materials as long as absolute measurements are not available. In principle, the cross contamination measurements should be used as a diagnostic tool on a regular basis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Design: An observational study of the changes brought about by the introduction of new structures to influence clinical practice and monitor change. Setting: North Thames (East) Health region, comprising seven purchasing health authorities and 21 acute hospitals treating breast cancer. Subjects: The multi-disciplinary breast teams in 21 hospitals and an audit sample of 419 (28%) of the breast cancer patients diagnosed in 1992 in the region. Interventions: Evidence-based interventions for changing clinical practice: regional guidelines, senior clinicians acting as 'opinion leaders', audit of quality rather than cost of services, ownership of data by clinicians, confidential feedback to participants and education. Outcome measures: Qualitative measures of organizational and behavioural change. Quantitative measures of clinical outcomes compared to guideline targets and to results from previous studies within this population. Results: Organizational changes included the involvement, participation of and feedback to 16 specialist surgeons and their multidisciplinary teams in 21 hospitals. Regional clinical guidelines were developed in 6 months and the dataset piloted within 9 months. The audit cycle was completed within 2 years. The pilot study led to prospective audit at the end of 2 years for all breast cancers in the region and a 15-fold increase in high quality clinical information for these patients. Changes in clinical practice between 1990 and 1992 were observed in the use of chemotherapy (up from 17-23%) and axillary surgery (up from 46-76%). Conclusions: The approach used facilitated rapid change and found a balance between local involvement (essential for sustainability within a hospital setting) and regional standardization (essential for comparability across hospitals). The principles of the approach are generalized to other cancers and to other parts of the UK and abroad. \u00a9 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "The living skeleton can be labeled for life by the administration of radiologically trivial amounts of 41Ca tracer. After initial elimination of tracer from the readily exchangeable calcium pools subsequent skeletal calcium turnover maintains and modulates the urine 41Ca content. Uniquely, bone calcium metabolism may then be studied with tracer in near equilibrium with the body's calcium and resorbing calcium directly measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of excreta. Our experiments with 25 41Ca labeled subjects demonstrate excellent diurnal stability and remarkable response to intervention of the urine signal. Thus the tracer method may prove a competitive means of measuring the effects of antiresorptive osteoporosis treatments, for therapy development or even clinical monitoring. Novel studies of long-term skeletal evolution are also possible. We realize that routinely administered short-lived calcium radiotracers contain 41Ca impurities and that thousands of experimental participants have been historically inadvertently 41Ca labeled. The 41Ca urine index might now rapidly further be characterized by contemporary measurements of these one-time subjects, and with their by now thoroughly skeleton-equilibrated tracer they might be ideal participants in other new experiments. We are also investigating 45Ca AMS. It may prove preferable to label the skeleton with this radiotracer already familiar to bioscientists, but new to AMS. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Foresters have always relied on a knowledge of chemical and physical properties of soils to assess capacity of sites to support productive forests. Recently, the need for assessing soil properties has expanded because of growing public interest in determining consequences of management practices on the quality of soil relative to sustainability of forest ecosystem functions in addition to plant productivity. The concept of soil quality includes assessment of soil properties and processes as they relate to ability of soil to function effectively as a component of a healthy ecosystem. Specific functions and subsequent values provided by forest ecosystems are variable and rely on numerous soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes, which can differ across spatial and temporal scales. Choice of a standard set of specific properties as indicators of soil quality can be complex and will vary among forest systems and management objectives. Indices of forest soil quality which incorporate soil chemical, physical, and biological properties will be most readily adopted if they are sensitive to management-induced changes, easily measured, relevant across sites or over time, inexpensive, closely linked to measurement of desired values, and adaptable for specific ecosystems. This paper traces development of the concept of soil quality, explores use of soil chemical and physical properties as determinants of forest soil quality, and presents challenges and opportunities for forest soil scientists to play a relevant role in assessment and advancement of sustainable forest management by developing the concept of soil quality as an indicator of sustainability. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Methods: 1250 subjects, from 18 to 64 years old, were randomly selected from the Santander (Spain) municipal census. A two-stage method was used: in the first stage, all individuals selected completed the BDI; in the second, 'probable cases' (BDI cut-off\u226513) and a random 5% sample of the total sample with a BDI score less than 13 were interviewed by psychiatrists using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), which generates diagnoses of depressive disorders. Results: Our data confirm the predictive value of the selected cut-off point (12/13): 100% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 0.72 PPV, 1 NPV, and 98% overall diagnostic value. The area under ROC (AUC) was found to be 0.99. There were no statistical differences in terms of sex or age. We conclude that the BDI is a good instrument for screening depressive disorders in community surveys. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Information on the size, shape, and rotational period of the asteroid is necessary for the planning of mission scenario, but available data on these properties are very limited. From our photometric observations in R band on the nights of August 2/3 and 3/4, 1997, we have found that the rotational period is 15.1 \u00b1 1.2 hours, the amplitude of brightness variation is about 0.9 mag, and the mean of the absolute magnitude is +18.3 mag. Our results suggest that the size of Nereus is nearly 1.1 km in diameter when the geometric albedo is 0.05. Although the slow rotation is preferable to the mission scenario, the large light variation results the highly elongated shape of Nereus. It is also appeared that comet nuclei is more preferred for the origin of Nereus than main-belt asteroids. \u00a9 1999 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Simultaneous measurements of nitrogen sorption and linear length change of silica aerogels with bulk moduli between 1.8 and 16 MPa reveal a characteristic shape of the isotherm that is due to contraction and reexpansion of the sample in different phases of adsorption and desorption. The capillary pressure upon filling and emptying of mesopores results in a volumetric contraction of up to 50%. Once the mesopores in the bulk of the contracted porous backbone are completely filled, the capillary pressure is released and the material slowly reexpands, accompanied by further adsorption until the sample is fully relaxed. This is the first time that the reexpansion close to saturation has been observed. The lack of this feature in previous experiments is due to insufficient equilibration of the sample upon adsorption. Analysis of the isotherm indicates that, even for compliant samples, a breakthrough radius can be extracted that is in excellent agreement with values derived from other methods. In addition, the isotherm of compliant samples allows for a calculation of bulk modulus.",

Two offshore spawning areas were identified in the central North Sea - central-northern and central-southern. A general linear model (GLM) showed plaice sexual maturation was influenced by body weight, age and geographical location and was subject to annual and seasonal variation. Few three year old female place appeared to spawn in the central North Sea, similar to the situation early in the 20th century. The condition factor of plaice peaked at the start of spawning and declined sharply during spawning, with older females investing the most heavily in reproduction, both in absolute and relative terms. The loss of older females through fishing is, therefore, likely to compromise the overall reproductive fitness of the remaining population, comprising of young females. The reproductive fitness of the males was also compromised, since young males tended to be in running condition for about a month less than older males. Reproductive investment in females was about twice the level found in males. There was evidence that plaice in the northern North Sea matured at a slower rate than fish in the south. From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s there was an increase in the proportion of young plaice reaching sexual maturity, following an earlier decline from the late 1970s. Problems with using maturity ogives derived from market sampling data in order to assess the proportion of spawning plaice in the North Sea are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The fluorescence surface of SRFA is described by five average fluorescent components, determined by spectral resolution using SIMPLISMA [W. Windig, J. Guilment, Anal. Chem. 63 (1991) 1425]. Fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths corresponding to these components was measured during titration with Cu(II). The resultant multiresponse data were fit to a five-site speciation model for Cu-SRFA interactions. The excitation/emission wavelengths identified for the fives sites are: 320/425, 370/450, 420/500, 480/540 and 500/550nm. Logarithms of the conditional stability constants assuming one to one complex stoichiometry for the five sites at pH 6.02 and ionic strength of 0.1M (KClO4) are: 4.95 (0.23), 4.98 (0.23), 5.32 (0.21), 5.59 (0.24), and 5.62 (0.22). The respective concentrations (\u03bcmol/mg of SRFA) are 0.83 (0.44), 2.38 (0.56), 2.76 (0.29), 0.74 (0.09), 0.037 (0.005), where the bracket values indicate \u00b195% confidence intervals. Free copper predicted using these parameters agrees within 0.1 of log unit of predicted free copper concentration from Cabaniss and Shuman's empirical equation [S.E. Cabaniss, M.S. Shuman, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 52 (1988) 185]. This agreement gives additional credence to the multiresponse multisite fluorescent method used in this paper. These values are compared to existing values for Al and H binding by SRFA, for the same five sites, also determined using multi-response fluorescence. The binding of Al, Cu and H are best represented as bidentate/diprotic sites. The conditional stability constants for Al and Cu are consistent with salicylic acid-like binding.

The smoothing capabilities of these two techniques were tested using both experimental and artificial data. We found a very peculiar and unexpected behavior. Although Ratzlaff-Johnoson's smoothing method fails completely to smooth an individual 2D set of data, something, which can be done effectively by Kuo's approach, it may give better results than Kuo's approach if it is used with the moving window technique.

So far, however, little attention has been given to the child's participation in medical interviews. In order to get a grip on aspects of asymmetry and control in doctor-parent-child communication, the present study explores the turntaking patterns in this triad at the general practitioner's surgery, and makes a comparison over the years. Videotaped observations of 106 medical interviews taken over a period of almost 20 years have been analyzed by means of the Turn Allocation System. The results show that the child's control in the medical consultation is rather limited, though, over the years, the child participates more actively. The child's conversational contribution appears to be strongly related to the age of the child. An important finding is the difference in the way GP and parent accommodate their turntaking patterns to the child; parental control appears to be constant over the years, and is not related to the age of the child, whereas the GP is considering the child's age. The results are discussed in terms of implications for medical practice and health education. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

This succession includes: FO of Lotharingius sigillatus (Mirabile Subzone); LO of Mitrolithus jansae (Semicelatum Subzone); FO of Carinolithus cantaluppii (Strangewaysi Subzone); LOs of Biscutum grande and Biscutum finchii (lower part of the Serpentinus Zone); FO of Carinolithus superbus (Strangewaysi-Falciferum boundary); FO of Lotharingius velatus (Falciferum Subzone); FOs of Discorhabdus striatus and Discorhabdus ignotus (Serpentinus-Bifrons boundary) and 'acme end' of Lotharingius hauffii (Variabilis-Illustris boundary). In the studied sections, the composition changes, the biohorizons recognized and their succession are closely comparable with other early-middle Toarcian Boreal sections.

Factors, which might influence this frequency of administration, were also studied. Research questions were investigated by secondary data-analysis of the Belgian Nursing Minimum Data Set. The randomised sample consisted of 1,035,681 observations on 421,530 patients. Results of this study demonstrate that one out of three (34%) hospitalised patients received intravenous medication. Medical diagnoses, for which most intravenous medications were administered, were oncological diseases: myeloid (77.9%) and lymphoid (69.4%) leukaemia. Elderly (6.7%) and female (31.2%) patients received significantly less intravenous medication than respectively young (32.9%) (Z2 = 98411, df= l, p < 0.001) and male (38%) (Z2= 2033, df= 1. p < 0.001) patients. Patients with intravenous medication administration were labour intensive for nursing staff. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Two methods for elevation-dependent spatial interpolation of climatic data from sparse weather station networks were compared. Thirty-year monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation data from regions in western and eastern Canada were interpolated using thin-plate smoothing splines (ANUSPLIN) and a statistical method termed 'Gradient plus Inverse-Distance-Squared' (GIDS). Data were withheld from approximately 50 stations in each region and both methods were then used to predict the monthly mean values for each climatic variable at those locations. The comparison revealed lower root mean square error (RMSE) for ANUSPLIN in 70 out of 72 months (three variables for 12 months for both regions). Higher RMSE for GIDS was caused by more frequent occurrence of extreme errors. This result had important implications for surfaces generated using the two methods. Both interpolators performed best in the eastern (Ontario/Quebec) region where topographic and climatic gradients are smoother, whereas predicting precipitation in the west (British Columbia/Alberta) was most difficult. In the latter case, ANUSPLIN clearly produced better results for most months. GIDS has certain advantages in being easy to implement and understand, hence providing a useful baseline to compare with more sophisticated methods. The significance of the errors for any method should be considered in light of the planned applications (e.g., in extensive, uniform terrain with low relief, differences may not be important).

Most current methods use statistics-based potentials and the development of these is ongoing. Additionally, the inclusion of multiple sequence data in the algorithms in order to aid in finding the native structure is a common theme. The use of physics-based potentials is less developed, which means that less progress has been made in understanding why a sequence forms a structure.",

Their importance has been established for myogenic development and in activation of the immediate-early gene, c-jun, and recently further functional roles in the immune system have emerged. The MEF2 factors belong to the MADS-box superfamily, sharing homology in a 58 amino acid domain that mediates DNA binding and dimerization. The structures of two MADS-box proteins, SRF and MCM1, bound to their cognate DNA have been previously reported and shown to share extensive similarity in their mode of DNA binding. We have solved the structure of MEF2A 2-78 bound to its DNA consensus sequence at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution. It reveals how the absence of amino acids N-terminal to the MADS-box contributes to the DNA binding properties of MEF2 proteins and shows that the MEF domain C-terminal to the MADS-box adopts a conformation considerably different from the same region in SRF and MCM1.

The benthic foraminifera prove to be excellent indicators of variations in the oxygen contents of the bottom waters, even more so than the stable isotopes. Our data indicate a step-wise restriction of the Mediterranean-Atlantic water exchange resulting in increasing sluggishness of deep-water circulation. The first indication of restricted circulation is seen at 8.5 Ma, which may correspond to a severe restriction of the external zone of the Betic Strait. A second event, which had a very serious influence on the fauna in the deeper Mediterranean, occurred at 7.16 Ma. This event was presumably linked to the partial closure of the Rifian Corridor. The restricted Mediterranean-Atlantic connection also seems to have led to a gradual salinity increase and possibly to the formation of a brine in the deepest basins, thus marking the first development towards the Messinian Salinity Crisis.

Social class of Cumbrian babies was ascertained from birth registrations. Community deprivation scores were calculated from census data for (i) enumeration districts in Cumbria and (ii) county districts in England and Wales. The relative index of inequality was used to measure inequality of stillbirth risk between social strata. Results indicate inequality in stillbirth risk in Cumbria has fallen significantly since 1966 (P \u2264 0.02) and was not evident in more recent time periods. In England and Wales, there was significant inequality in stillbirth risk in all time periods and no evidence that this has changed over time. Inequality in stillbirth risk has not increased and in some areas has attenuated in recent years. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

In addition, we used phytometers planted with Molinia caerulea tillers to measure the nutrient supply in the soil. Soil acidity was the variable most strongly correlated with plant species diversity in heathland and grassland communities. We found that increased N:P and N:K ratios in plant biomass had additional negative effects.

Commonly utilised disability outcome measures are problematic both in usefulness and clinical interpretation when applied to MS subjects with fluctuating and variable disease courses. An alternative technique is to use the summary measure 'area under the disability/time curve' (AUC) to index the total in-trial morbidity experienced by patients. In this study, we applied AUC analyses to the serial Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores from the U.S. multicentre, Phase III, two-year core study of glatiramer acetate in 251 RRMS patients. When all available EDSS evaluations were analysed with AUC(CHANGE) ('combined data', including relapse-related assessments), active treatment was significantly superior to placebo (P=0.018). The benefits of glatiramer acetate persisted when transient relapse effects were reduced by using 'scheduled visit data' only (P=0.021). With the more conservative AUC(SUM) measure, significant active treatment effects remained (P=0.029 and 0.046, for both 'combined' and 'scheduled visit' data, respectively). Subgroup calculations performed with baseline disability stratified at EDSS 3.5 also showed benefits of treatment over placebo, but statistical significance was not reached. This analysis of data from a Phase III treatment trial illustrates the AUC summary measure technique and provides further evidence of the efficacy of glatiramer acetate in RRMS.

However, also some drawbacks exist, i.e. the analysis of basic compounds is often hampered by ionic interaction of the basic analytes with residual silanols present on the silica surface, which results in asymmetrical peaks and irreproducible retention. In this review, options to optimise the LC analysis of basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, i.e. eluent optimisation (pH, silanol blockers) and stationary phase optimisation (development of new columns with minimised ionic interactions). The applicability of empirical based, thermodynamically based and test methods based on a retention model to characterise silica-based reversed phase stationary phases, as well as the influence of the eluent composition on the LC analysis of basic substances is described. Finally, the applicability of chemometrical techniques in column classification is shown. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

On top of the poorly sorted aeolian sediments, a cambic aridisol with a mighty Cca horizon containing numerous calcite nodules developed, presumably during the transition period between the Middle and Younger Holocene, and was finally covered by desert margin loess. A relatively humid period during the Younger Holocene is documented by another brown soil, which has developed on top of younger aeolian sediments and is itself covered beneath recent sands in the basin of Omungunda. The intercalation of soils in finely clastic aeolian deposits do express climatic oscillations with characterizing impacts on the landscape, and a connected shift of the desert margin.

In this reaction methyl-coenzyme M and coenzyme B are converted to methane and the heterodisulfide of coenzyme M and coenzyme B. The crystal structures of methyl-coenzyme M reductase from Methanosarcina barkeri (growth temperature optimum, 37\u00b0C) and Methanopyrus kandleri (growth temperature optimum, 98\u00b0C) were determined and compared with the known structure of MCR from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (growth temperature optimum, 65\u00b0C). The active sites of MCR from M. barkeri and M. kandleri were almost identical to that of M. thermoautotrophicum and predominantly occupied by coenzyme M and coenzyme B. The electron density at 1.6 \u00c5 resolution of the M. barkeri enzyme revealed that four of the five modified amino acid residues of MCR from M. thermoautotrophicum, namely a thiopeptide, an S-methylcysteine, a 1-N-methylhistidine and a 5-methylarginine were also present. Analysis of the environment of the unusual amino acid residues near the active site indicates that some of the modifications may be required for the enzyme to be catalytically effective. In M. thermoautotrophicum and M. kandleri high temperature adaptation is coupled with increasing intracellular concentrations of lyotropic salts. This was reflected in a higher fraction of glutamate residues at the protein surface of the thermophilic enzymes adapted to high intracellular salt concentrations. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "This study was done to evaluate the impact of pure Norway spruce stands on physical soil properties of top soil in comparison to mixed species stands on comparable sites. It was hypothesized that the flat root system of spruce causes soil compaction, which would have a negative impact on the soil aeration and hydraulic properties and consequently on seedbed quality, as well as early tree growth and seedling establishment. Hence, this topic is important for forest restoration, especially converting secondary pure spruce stands to mixed species stands. Forty-eight sites (24 pairs pure spruce stand/mixed species stand) of different stand development stages (mature stage, pole stage) were selected on two different bedrock materials (Molasse, Flysch). Undisturbed soil cores were taken from 0-4 and 4-8 cm soil depth and the following soil parameters were determined: (total) bulk density, remaining fine soil bulk density, dry masses of coarse fragments, roots and forest floor, organic carbon content, total soil pore volume as well as macropore volumes (after free drainage for 24 h and after water desorption at 10 kPa). The remaining fine soil bulk density was a useful parameter for characterization of the state of compactness. Pure spruce stands caused a lower bulk density of the upper mineral soil due to lifting and loosening of the soil above the root system. Results of calculated macropore volumes after water desorption at 10 kPa were exactly conform with those obtained for the remaining fine soil bulk density, indicating significant differences for the grouping variables bedrock material and species composition. It is concluded from this study that changes of soil physical properties of the upper mineral soil (0-8 cm soil depth) by Norway spruce will not reduce germination and growth of mixed species trees. However, chemical and nutritional changes were not subject of this study, which are expected to limit the success of forest restoration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We find that the industry share of national output follows a Kuznets-type trajectory, but the other two determinants do not. When combined, our results imply rejection of the EKC hypothesis for industrial water pollution: it rises rapidly through middle-income status and remains roughly constant thereafter.

        "Absrtact": "Whilst the interplay between tectonics, glaciation and oceanography is reasonably well understood on some high-latitude margins, relatively little is known about the nature of Quaternary processes affecting the continental margin north of the Faeroe Islands. We therefore present side-scan sonar (GLORIA and TOBI) and 3.5 kHz data in combination with a new regional bathymetry in order to characterise and analyse the margin's physiography and the sedimentary processes that have occurred in the area during the Late Quaternary. Seven acoustic facies are identified and interpreted, in combination with published core records. The margin is subject to differing sedimentation regimes over glacial/interglacial cycles, relating to the changing importance of contouritic, hemipelagic, glacimarine and mass-movement processes. Mass movement is much more extensive than previously thought, with a total sediment volume of >2000 km3, similar to that of the Storegga Slide (5500 km3) and may occur primarily at glacial terminations. The downslope limit of instabilities is associated with a series of channels, focusing the deposition of distal, turbiditic sediments into the regional deep beyond. Together with glacigenic debris flows from the western margin of the North Sea Fan, mass-movement processes are identified to have affected 52-70% of the North Faeroes margin area. In contrast, distal glacimarine sedimentation, alternating with hemipelagic and contouritic development, is found on the remaining 30-48% of the margin during glacials, and hemipelagic and contouritic Sedimentation are active across 90% of the margin in interglacial conditions. Despite a lack of any local, direct glacial influence, these observations on the relative importance of sedimentation processes are comparable with other glacially influenced passive margins.

As a test of this hypothesis, we carried out a 4T functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which subjects named visually presented objects sub-vocally.

Responses were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-21, divided into: Core, Activity, Psychic anxiety, Somatic anxiety and Delusion clusters) administered at baseline and weekly until the 6th week. Random Regression Model (RRM) analysis was used to investigate the longitudinal time course of HAMD clusters. HAMD depressive symptom clusters decreased in a parallel manner from baseline to the end of the 6-week trial. The RRM analysis revealed no significant difference between HAMD clusters and the time course of the total HAMD score during treatment.

        "Absrtact": "Extensive research has been conducted regarding the occurrence of herbicides in the hydrologic system, their fate, and their effects on human health and the environment. Few studies, however, have considered herbicide transformation products (degradates). In this study of Iowa ground water, herbicide degradates were frequently detected. In fact, herbicide degradates were eight of the 10 most frequently detected compounds. Furthermore, a majority of a herbicide's measured concentration was in the form of its degradates - ranging from 55 to over 99%. The herbicide detection frequencies and concentrations varied significantly among the major aquifer types sampled. These differences, however, were much more pronounced when herbicide degradates were included. Aquifer types presumed to have the most rapid recharge rates (alluvial and bedrock/karst region aquifers) were those most likely to contain detectable concentrations of herbicide compounds. Two indirect estimates of ground-water age (depth of well completion and dissolved-oxygen concentration) were used to separate the sampled wells into general vulnerability classes (low, intermediate, and high). The results show that the herbicide detection frequencies and concentrations varied significantly among the vulnerability classes regardless of whether or not herbicide degradates were considered. Nevertheless, when herbicide degradates were included, the frequency of herbicide compound detection within the highest vulnerability class approached 90%, and the median total herbicide residue concentration increased over an order of magnitude, relative to the parent compounds alone, to 2 \u03bcg/l. The results from this study demonstrate that obtaining data on herbicide degradates is critical for understanding the fate of herbicides in the hydrologic system. Furthermore, the prevalence of herbicide degradates documented in this study suggests that to accurately determine the overall effect on human health and the environment of a specific herbicide its degradates should also be considered.

        "Absrtact": "Time series of suspended-silt concentration (measured by an optical backscatter sensor) and suspended-sand concentration (measured by an acoustic backscatter sensor) in a deep channel (14 m MSL) of a large New Zealand estuary (Manukau Harbour) are analysed. Suspended-sand concentration varied in phase with the current speed and bed shear stress on a ~ 6.2-h cycle, but suspended-silt concentration varied on a semidiurnal (~ 12.4-h) cycle such that the channel was clear of silt at high tide and maximum silt concentration occurred at low tide. Threshold for initiation of sand motion was found to be related to local skin friction, sand concentration profiles were consistent with settling flux balanced by gradient diffusion with a two-layer sediment diffusivity dependent on local friction velocity, suspended-sand reference concentration was explainable in terms of local skin friction, and changes in the channel-bed sediment were correlated with the suspended-sand load. Therefore, sand suspension in the channel is a 'local' process and the channel bed is the source of the suspended-sand load. Suspended-sand flux was found to be a highly nonlinear function of the tidal current speed in the channel. In that case, tidal-current velocity asymmetry is the principal determinant of direction of net sand transport and the ebb/flood-dominance concept is valid. The relative phase of the M2 and M4 constituents of the tidal-current velocity, which quantifies tidal-current asymmetry, was calculated from a tide model of the estuary and results were mapped. The harbour was found to be broadly ebb dominant and therefore self-flushing of sand. Silt suspension in the channel was not related to the local boundary-layer dynamics, but was explainable in terms of the movement up and down the channel of a horizontal gradient in silt concentration, which implies the existence of a turbid water mass that is perched on the surrounding intertidal flats at high tide and that drains into the channel during ebb tide. Silt concentration in the channel increased during a short storm, which corresponded to the passage through the measurement site of a 'turbid fringe' that was formed on the surrounding intertidal flats during the previous high tide under the action of breaking waves. Wave activity on the surrounding intertidal flats is therefore the principal determinant of suspended-silt load in the channel and an approach that treats waves and sediment pathways between intertidal flats and channels is needed for modelling silt transport.

Absorption was calculated at each location across the surface of the wafer and used to produce colour-coded plots that allow the wafer's characteristics to be determined at a glance. The program ran on VAX/VMS computers, but these are being taken out of service due to obsolescence. To overcome these problems, the author developed a graphics script using a state-of-the-art data analysis program which provides quick classification of GaAs wafers based on traps and defects, but runs on inexpensive personal computers and, as a bonus, produces bit-map plots that can be cut and pasted into Windows word processing and presentation software.",

In an attempt to improve this method, several solvents (methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl tert.-butyl ether, BuOH) were tested to dissolve LA2H+. MtBE produced less bleeding than MiBK, whereas BuOH proved unsuitable. The sample injected needs to be highly diluted in water to ensure participation in the chromatographic process.

First products consist of longwave and shortwave fluxes on a spatial scale of 60 x 60 km2 at nadir. Due to the very good calibration of the instrument it is very well suited for comparison of the earth radiation components with those computed by mesoscale atmosperic models. This is done here for the regional scale model REMO which is in use for modelling activities within the BALTEX programmes. Results of this comparison for the outgoing longwave radiation for March 1994 are shown. Additionaly the mean clear sky longwave cloud forcing for March 1994 is investigated. The difference between the measurement and the model are very small and in the order of 5 to 10 W/m2, which is well within the uncertainty of the measurements from ScaRaB. Together with a method developed to derive a high spatial and temporal earth radiation budget product from the ScaRaB measurements it is expected to extend the investigation to the shortwave flux. A comparison of instantaneous measurements of the albedo derived from NOAA-AVHR with model results are shown (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The late Cenozoic potassic volcanic provinces of Wudalianchi, Erkeshan and Keluo are located at the boundary between the Great Xing'an Mountains and the northwestern margin of the Songliao Basin, the eastern part of the Central Asian Fold Belt, in northeastern China. Mantle xenoliths found in the potassic rocks are mainly spinel peridotite (some phlogopite-bearing) associated with minor Fe-rich peridotite (some phlogopite-bearing) and pyroxenite. Clinopyroxene in the spinel peridotite xenoliths is generally low in Al2O3, Sc, Y and heavy rare earth elements and along with orthopyroxene and spinel has high Cr/ (Cr + Al). The bulk rock has low basaltic components (Al2O3, CaO and TiO2), demonstrating their refractory nature. However, the relatively low forsterite contents (<0.915) of olivine and high bulk rock Ca/Al (1.3-4.1) and Mg/Si (1.2-1.6) ratios at given Mg/(Mg + Fe) distinguish them from either Archaean lithospheric mantle or the residue of melt extraction from Phanerozoic oceanic mantle. Clinopyroxenes from all the xenoliths are enriched in light rare earth elements, Th and Pb and depleted in high field strength elements, with similar incompatible element and rare earth element patterns. Clinopyroxenes from the spinel peridotite xenoliths have 87Sr/86Sr (0.70480-0.70516) higher than primitive mantle, but variable ENd values (+6.9 to -2.0). Petrological and geochemical evidence from the xenoliths supports a common two-stage evolution model for the upper part of the lithospheric mantle in the region. The mantle protolith was stabilised after moderate to high degrees of melt extraction (e.g. 8-13% for fractional melting) and then metasomatised extensively by SiO2-undersaturated potassic magma that was likely generated from low-degree partial melting of either deep asthenosphere or metasomatised lower part of lithospheric mantle. Both the melt extraction and metasomatic event(s) may have occurred during the Proterozoic. Geochemical signatures of the spinel peridotite xenoliths and the inferred garnet peridotites at the base of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle from chemistry of the host potassic rocks (Zhang et al., J. Petrol., 36 (1995) 1275; Zhang et al., AGU Geodynamic Series, 27 (1998) 197) indicates the preservation of a Proterozoic lithospheric mantle section within the Phanerozoic Central Asian Fold Belt. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Development and application of a software product for aquaculture facility design and management planning are described (AquaFarm, Oregon State University (C)). AquaFarm provides: (1) simulation of physical, chemical, and biological unit processes; (2) simulation of facility and fish culture management; (3) compilation of facility resource and enterprise budgets; and (4) a graphical user interface and data management capabilities. These analytical tools are combined into an interactive, decision support system for the simulation, analysis, and evaluation of alternative design and management strategies. The quantitative methods and models used in AquaFarm are primarily adapted from the aquaculture science and engineering literature and mechanistic in nature. In addition, new methods have been developed and empirically based simplifications implemented as required to construct a comprehensive, practically oriented, system level, aquaculture simulator. In the use of AquaFarm, aquaculture production facilities can be of any design and management intensity, for purposes of broodfish maturation, egg incubation, and/or growout of finfish or crustaceans in cage, single pass, serial reuse, water recirculation, or solar-algae pond systems. The user has total control over all facility and management specifications, including site climate and water supplies, components and configurations of fish culture systems, fish and facility management strategies, unit costs of budget items, and production species and objectives (target fish weights/states and numbers at given future dates). In addition, parameters of unit process models are accessible to the user, including species-specific parameters of fish performance models. Based on these given specifications, aquaculture facilities are simulated, resource requirements and enterprise budgets compiled, and operation and management schedules determined so that fish production objectives are achieved. When facility requirements or production objectives are found to be operationally or economically unacceptable, desired results are obtained through iterative design refinement. Facility performance is reported to the user as management schedules, summary reports, enterprise budgets, and tabular and graphical compilations of time-series data for unit process, fish, and water quality variables. Application of AquaFarm to various types of aquaculture systems is demonstrated. AquaFarm is applicable to a range of aquaculture interests, including education, development, and production.

A series of crystal structures at ~1.7 \u00c5 have been determined using data collected from different crystals. Several conformations are observed for the copper site from one of the subunits. These conformations lie between those expected for the Cu(II) and Cu(I) forms of the enzyme and may represent a slow positional rearrangement of the Cu site during the crystallisation process due to the presence of a trace reductant in the mother liquor. These states perhaps indicate some functionally relevant structural steps that ultimately result in the breakage of the imidazolate bridge between the two metal sites. This behaviour is not observed for the second subunit of the dimeric enzyme, which remains in the five-coordinate, distorted square planar geometry in all cases. We suggest that this asymmetric behaviour may be caused by the lack of mobility for the Glu119-Leu142 loop region in the second subunit caused by crystal contacts. This region forms one wall of the active-site cavity, and its mobility has been suggested, via molecular dynamics studies, to be important for the catalytic mechanism. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

Fungal species-richness and species-composition were related to climate, soil, vegetation and stand variables across a range of crop stages. Altogether, 419 species were recorded (12 parasites, 76 wood saprotrophs, 174 mycorrhizal species, 157 litter saprotrophs). There were no differences in fungal species-richness between plantations and semi-natural woodlands nor any effects of crop species age or type. Significant positive correlations were recorded between fungal species-richness and ground vegetation diversity, and between wood saprotroph-richness and fallen deadwood volume. Each crop species type had a distinctive mycota related to differences in climate, tree and vegetation diversity. Over-mature stands had a higher proportion of 'late-successional' mycorrhizal species than the other growth stages. Nineteen Red Data list fungi species were recorded; plots nearer to semi-natural pinewood areas had a higher number of species records. These results highlight the importance of planted forests as a habitat for native fungi. Habitat value could be further enhanced through increasing the area of 'old-growth' non-intervention reserves, and locating these reserves near existing semi-natural woodland fragments.

        "Absrtact": "The ocean is an important sink for carbon and heat, yet high-resolution measurements of biogeochemical properties relevant to global climate change are being made only sporadically in the ocean at present. There is a growing need for automated, real-time, long-term measurements of CO2 in the ocean using a network of sensors, strategically placed on ships, moorings, free-drifting buoys and autonomous remotely operated vehicles. The ground-truthing of new sensor technologies is a vital component of present and future efforts to monitor changes in the ocean carbon cycle and air-sea exchange of CO2. A comparison of a moored Carbon Interface Ocean Atmosphere (CARIOCA) buoy and shipboard fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) measurements was conducted in the western North Atlantic during two extended periods (> 1 month) in 1997. The CARIOCA buoy was deployed on the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM), which is located 5 km north of the site of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). The high frequency of sampling revealed that temperature and fCO2 responded to physical forcing by the atmosphere on timescales from diurnal to 4-8 days. Concurrent with the deployments of the CARIOCA buoy, frequent measurements of surface fCO2 were made from the R/V Weatherbird II during opportunistic visits to the BTM and BATS sites, providing a direct calibration of the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data. Although, the in situ ground-truthing of the CARIOCA buoy was complicated by diurnal processes, sub-mesoscale and fine-scale variability, the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data was accurate within 3 \u00b1 6 \u03bcatm of shipboard fCO2 data for periods up to 50 days. Longer-term assessments were not possible due to the CARIOCA buoy breaking free of the BTM and drifting into waters with different fCO2-temperature properties. Strategies are put forward for future calibration of other in situ sensors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The four new scenarios have been developed by four different modeling teams. The four scenarios are noninterventionist, in that they do not include abatement of GHG emissions for the purpose of climate-change mitigation. The time evolution of the changes in global-mean surface-air temperature and sea level are calculated for each scenario by our energy-balance-climate/upwelling-diffusion-ocean model. The temperature changes individually and jointly for the radiative forcing by the GHGs and by the sulfate aerosol, which is formed in the atmosphere from the emitted SO2. These GHG- and SO2-induced global-mean temperature changes are used to scale in time the geographical distributions of surface-air temperature simulated by our University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) atmospheric-general-circulation/mixed-layer-ocean model, respectively for a doubling of the CO2 amount and for a 10-fold increase in present-day SO2 emission - the latter from the entire earth as well as individually from Europe, Siberia, North Africa, Asia, North America, and the Southern Hemisphere - each geographical distribution having been normalized by its respective global-mean surface-air temperature change. It is found that: (1) the global-mean surface-air temperature changes are not distinguishable among the four scenarios presented here until near the middle of the 21st century; (2) in 2100, the warming and sea level rise range from 1.2\u00b0C and 27 cm for the Bl scenario, with a temperature sensitivity of \u0394T2x = 1.5\u00b0C to 4.9\u00b0C and 72 cm for the A2 scenario, with \u0394T2x = 4.5\u00b0C, with 62 and 69% of these 3.7\u00b0C and 45 cm ranges respectively resulting from the uncertainty in \u0394T2x, and 38 and 31% from the scenario uncertainty; (3) the scenario uncertainty in future noninterventionist CO2 emissions translates into a large uncertainty about the geographical distribution of the warming, particularly in the Arctic; (4) the reduction in regional SO2 emissions of the four scenarios compared to IS92a results in a significant warming of Europe, Asia, and North America, as well as either a reduction or reversal of the cooling elsewhere, thereby showing that mitigation of the acid-rain problem exacerbates the greenhouse-warming problem; and (5) sulfate aerosol reduces the GHG-induced warming in the Arctic for IS92a, but increases the Arctic warming for the four scenarios. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "During the Holocene, the eastern Sahara underwent a drastic climatic change: in less than 6000 years, the climate changed from hyperaridity to semiaridity and back to its current hyperarid state. The West Nubian Palaeolake Basin in NW Sudan (ca 18.5\u00b0N/25.5\u00b0E) contains widespread lake carbonates, which indicate development of a freshwater lake between approximately 9500 and 4000 years BP. The size of the lake has been estimated as between 1100 and 7000 km2. Water balance calculations and a dense drainage net surrounding the terminal lake indicate predominance of superficial and minor importance of groundwater inflow. A lake with an area of 1100 km2 would require an annual precipitation of approximately 500 mm to balance the respective aerial evaporation. Similar precipitation values are currently observed at a latitude of 12\u00b0N, some 600 km farther south, while the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin receives an annual rainfall of less than 15 mm/year. A lake size of 7000 km2 would have required 900 mm of annual rainfall, an amount characteristic of sub-tropical conditions. This value could indicate inhomogenities in the wet phase climate, which could strongly influence the water level of a terminal lake located in a flat terrain. The highly depleted oxygen isotope values of the lake carbonates indicate that the Holocene wet phase was characterized by intense tropical summer (monsoonal) rainfall with heavy thunderstorms. Thus, an intensified southwest palaeomonsoon apparently transported large quantities of moisture to the eastern Sahara, producing the necessary conditions for the persisting existence of freshwater in the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin. The reconstructed palaeoclimate implies high groundwater levels and corresponds to precipitation rates from other sites in North Africa. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

SWAT was applied to a small watershed in south central Wisconsin using eight different watershed delineations, each with different numbers of subwatersheds, over the time period 1990-96. Model predictions for streamflow and outlet sediment were not strongly affected by changes in subwatershed size, probably because of the transport-limiting nature of this watershed and the stable transport capacity of the lower part of the channel. Sediment generation estimates do change greatly, however, dropping by 44% between the coarsest and finest watershed delineations, mainly because a runoff term in the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation is very sensitive to the area of the hydrologic response unit.

        "Absrtact": "We describe the mineralogical and chemical composition of the Northern Slave mantle as deduced from xenoliths of peridotite within the Jericho kimberlite, Northwest Territories. Our data set includes modal, major, trace and rare earth element compositions of bulk samples of spinel peridotite, low-T and high-T garnet peridotite and minor pyroxenite. Compared to primitive upper mantle, Jericho peridotite shows depletion in the major elements and enrichment in incompatible elements (except for HREE). The Slave mantle is also uniquely stratified. Older, depleted spinel peridotite extends to a depth of 80-100 km and is underlain by garnet peridotite which shows a gradual decrease in Mg with depth to 200 km. The youngest layer of fertile garnet peridotite, enriched in clinopyroxene and garnet, is underlain by a pyroxenite-rich horizon at the base of the petrological lithosphere. The Northern Slave is further distinguished from the Kaapvaal and Siberian upper mantle by a marked vertical stratification in Mg, lower abundances of orthopyroxene and higher abundances of clinopyroxene. In addition, a deeper layer of garnet peridotite below Jericho shows less depletion than low-T peridotite from other cratons. The Northern Slave peridotite results from a series of chemical events that include: (i) high-degree melting of pyrolite at P>3 Gpa for low-T peridotite and lower pressure melting for high-T peridotite, (ii) enrichment of low-T spinel peridotite in orthopyroxene, and (iii) pervasive metasomatic enrichment in alkali and LREE's by kimberlite-related fluids. The chemical stratification described for two of the three lithospheric domains of the Slave craton makes this craton an exception among cratons with commonly unstratified lithospheres. The gradual increase in fertility with depth below the Slave craton is related to age stratification and may have formed by incremental downward growth of mantle lithosphere with time, and/or later re-fertilization of deeper mantle horizons.

        "Absrtact": "A method is presented for simultaneously estimating a system of nonparametric regressions which may seem unrelated, but where the errors are potentially correlated between equations. We show that the advantage of estimating such a 'seemingly unrelated' system of nonparametric regressions is that less observations can be required to obtain reliable function estimates than if each of the regression equations is estimated separately and the correlation ignored. This increase in efficiency is investigated empirically using both simulated and real data. The method uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework where each regression function is represented as a linear combination of a large number of basis terms. All the regression coefficients, and the variance matrix of the errors, are estimated simultaneously by their posterior means. The computation is carried out using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme that employs a 'focused sampling' step to combat the high-dimensional representation of the unknown regression functions. The methodology extends easily to other nonparametric multivariate regression models. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "We examined structural features of montane ash stands that varied from 15 to 300+ years of age in the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Extensive field data were gathered for our investigation and were drawn from >3700 survey plots on >625 sites located throughout the study region. Much of our study focussed on understorey features because extensive past studies in these forests have highlighted their importance as key habitat components for wildlife. A wide range of stand features, including the abundance of shrubs, the prevalence of tree ferns, the presence of Acacia spp., the presence of Myrtle Beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii), and the number of vegetation strata (a measure of vertical heterogeneity) varied considerably between age classes; most attributes were significantly (p < 0.001) less likely to occur or were significantly less abundant in young logged forests. Highly significant differences in these structural features also were found in stands dominated by different tree species (Mountain Ash [Eucalyptus regnans] and Alpine Ash [E. delegatensis]). The traditional view of disturbance in montane ash forests is that of high-intensity stand-replacing wildfires which produce even-aged regrowth forests. However, our data suggest that low-intensity, non-stand-replacing fires or only partial stand-replacing fires, have occurred in many old-growth montane ash stands, both to create multi-aged stands and to re-juvenate components of the understorey - a process leading to asynchrony in the ages of understorey and some elements of the overstorey. Thus, the structural variability, and the patterns of natural disturbance leading to such conditions, appears to be more complex than often previously recognised. This has important implications for both nature conservation strategies and timber harvesting practices in montane ash forests. Existing high-intensity clearfell logging operations produce an even-aged dominant overstorey as well as understorey and overstorey plants of the same age. If logging effects are to more closely resemble natural disturbance regimes and promote structural complexity in stands of harvested forest to enhance wildlife habitat values, then a wider range of types of harvesting methods (in addition to clearfelling) need to be employed.

        "Absrtact": "Cooked meat products are often post-contaminated because of a packaging and/or slicing step after the pasteurisation process. The shelf life is therefore limited and can be extended by adding Na-lactate. A previously developed model for the spoilage of gas packed cooked meat products, including temperature, water activity and dissolved CO2 as independent variables, was extended with a fourth factor: the Na-lactate concentration in the aqueous phase of the meat product. Models were developed for the maximum specific growth rate \u03bc(max) and the lag phase \u03bb of the specific spoilage organism Lactobacillus sake subsp. carnosum. Quadratic response surface equations were compared with extended Ratkowsky models. In general, response surface equations fitted the experimental data best but in the case of \u03bc(max), the response surface model predicted illogical growth behaviour at low water activities and high Na-lactate concentrations. A extensive product validation of the mathematical models was performed by means of inoculated as well as naturally contaminated industrially prepared cooked meat products. The deviations of the experimentally determined versus predicted growth parameters in inoculated cooked meat products were in general small. Both types of models were also able to predict the shelf life of naturally contaminated cooked meat products, except for pate where an under-estimation of the shelf life was predicted by the response surface equations. The validation studies revealed higher accuracy of the extended Ratkowsky models in comparison to the response surface equations. A significant shelf life extending effect of Na-lactate was predicted, which was more pronounced at low refrigerated temperatures. A synergistic effect has also been noticed between Na-lactate and carbon dioxide which, at least partly, could be explained by the pH-decreasing effect of CO2.

This paper reviews the potential to estimate marine primary production from satellite images. The procedures involved in retrieving estimates of phytoplankton biomass, as pigment concentrations, are discussed. Algorithms are applied to SeaWiFS ocean colour data to indicate seasonal variations in phytoplankton biomass in the Celtic Sea, on the continental shelf to the south west of the UK. Algorithms to estimate primary production rates from chlorophyll concentration are compared and the advantages and disadvantage discussed. The simplest algorithms utilise correlations between chlorophyll concentration and production rate and one equation is used to estimate daily primary production rates for the western English Channel and Celtic Sea; these estimates compare favourably with published values. Primary production for the central Celtic Sea in the period April to September inclusive is estimated from SeaWiFS data to be 102 gC m-2 in 1998 and 93 gC m-2 in 1999; published estimates, based on in situ incubations, are ca. 80 gC m-2. The satellite data demonstrate large variations in primary production between 1998 and 1999, with a significant increase in late summer in 1998 which did not occur in 1999. Errors are quantified for the estimation of primary production from simple algorithms based on satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration. These data show the potential to obtain better estimates of marine primary production than are possible with ship-based methods, with the ability to detect short-lived phytoplankton blooms. In addition, the potential to estimate new production from satellite data is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The Oman ophiolite exposes a large and well-preserved mantle section beneath a palaeo-spreading centre. The mantle section is mainly composed of extremely refractory harzburgites with relatively homogeneous modal and major element compositions. Nevertheless, our trace element data exhibit variations connected with the main mantle structures, which allow us to define three geochemical and structural domains. The main harzburgitic mantle section, mainly constituted of strongly refractory harzburgites characterised by chondrite-normalised REE patterns that are steadily depleted from HREE to LREE. These rocks are interpreted as mantle residues after >15% melt extraction. Their REE signature can be explained by melt transport associated with partial melting. The diapir areas (mainly the Maqsad diapir), defined by plunging lineations. They are constituted of harzburgites with roughly the same modal composition as the main mantle section but distinct, concave-upward REE patterns. The regions of most active upwelling (characterised by sub-vertical lineations) are further distinguished by higher Al2O3/CaO ratios and TiO2 contents. This character is ascribed to focused partial melt upwelling. The diapirs are interpreted as local instabilities in upwelling mantle, possibly triggered by feedback mechanisms between deformation and melt percolation. The Maqsad diapir is topped by a thick, dunitic, mantle-crust transition zone (MTZ) that displays the same trace-element signature as the diapir. However, the dunites are distinguishedby low MG values and Ni contents. Together with structural evidence, this allows us to interpret the MTZ dunites as diapir harzburgites that were strongly modified by olivine-forming melt-rock reactions at high melt/rock ratios. The MTZ is thought to act as a major collecting zone for mantle melts. The cpx-harzburgites from the base of the mantle section. These rocks are distinguished by high clinopyroxene contents (>5%), low AL2O3/CaO and 'spoon-shaped' REE patterns. They were individualised from the rest of the harzburgite mantle section by a cpx-forming melt-rock reaction at decreasing malt mass. This reaction probably occurred at near-solidus conditions along the lithospere-asthenospere boundary. The formation of these three domains may be integrated in a geodynamic scenario involving the reactivation of an oceanic lithospere, a process that would be related to the ridge propagator identified in the Oman ophiolite.

        "Absrtact": "The goal of this study was to design a reliable method to quantify and visualize the anatomical distribution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) intracranially. The method should be clinically applicable and based on multispectral analysis of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance images. T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density-weighted fast 3D gradient pulse sequences were used to form high resolution multispectral 3D images of the entire head. Training on single 2D slices, the Mahalanobis distances between the resulting multivariate tissue-specific densities were studied as functions of the feature vector composition and dimension. Multispectral analysis was applied to the images of four human brains. One feature vector with three components gave CSF volumes that were in the normal range and corresponding anatomical distributions that largely agreed with general anatomical knowledge. The exception was CSF missing around the basal parts of the brain due to signal artifacts. These artifacts were almost certainly due to the coil effect and magnetic field inhomogeneities induced by the imaged head. Such misclassifications could probably be reduced by bias field estimation and proper image restoration. Most CSF voxels formed large connected components that were found automatically, so the manual post-processing of the classified 3D image to locate CSF voxels was moderate. It is concluded that some of the fast, high resolution 3D gradient echo pulse sequences that have become available on conventional clinical scanners can be used to obtain good estimates of brain cerebrospinal fluid anatomical distribution and volume. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

They are proposed to donate elementary sulphur, generated from cysteine, via a cysteinepersulphide intermediate during iron sulphur cluster biosynthesis, an important albeit not well understood process. Here, we report on the crystal structure of a NifS-like protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (tmNifS) at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. The tmNifS is structured into two domains, the larger bearing the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-binding active site, the smaller hosting the active site cysteine in the middle of a highly flexible loop, 12 amino acid residues in length. Once charged with sulphur the loop could possibly deliver S0 directly to regions far remote from the protein. Based on the three-dimensional structures of the native as well as the substrate complexed form and on spectrophotometric results, a mechanism of sulphur activation is proposed. The His99, which stacks on top of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate co-factor, is assigned a crucial role during the catalytic cycle by acting as an acid-base catalyst and is believed to have a pK(a) value depending on the co-factor redox state.

An overview of 22 applications of Markov chain models is presented, using data from four sources examining different grassland communities with varying sampling techniques, data types and vegetation parameters. For microdata, individual transitions have been observed, and several statistical tests of model assumptions are performed. The goodness of fit of the model predictions is assessed both for micro- and macrodata using the mean square error, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. It is concluded that the performance of the model varies between data sets, microdata generate a lower mean square error than aggregated macrodata, and time steps of one year are preferable to three months. The rank order of dominant species is found to be the most reliable prediction achievable with the models proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Magnetite composition was found to be the strongest controlling factor on partitioning behavior. The partition coefficients (D) for Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta correlate with D(Ti), Ti and Al content of the magnetite, temperature and pressure. The partition coefficients for the HFSE are similar to one another for any given magnetite-melt pair, but range from <0.02 in Cr, Al-rich magnetites and chromites to >2 in titanomagnetite. In addition, the relationship between Ti and the HFSE changes as a function of pressure and temperature, with the HFSE becoming more incompatible relative to Ti at lower temperatures and/or higher pressures. This change in the relationship between D(Ti) and D(HFSE) with temperature and pressure means that the expressions presented in Nielsen et al. (1994) [Nielsen, R.L., Forsythe, L.M., Gallaghan, W.E., Fisk, M.R., 1994. Major and trace element magnetite-melt partitioning. Chem. Geol. 117, 167-191.] are not valid for hydrous, aluminous systems. Expressions were derived to describe the relationship between D(HFSE) and temperature, pressure, Fe2+/Mg exchange, Ti/Al ratio of the magnetite, and D(Ti). These expressions reproduce the input data within 35-50% (1 \u03c3) over a range extending from highly incompatible to compatible (<0.02-3.0). This internal precision represents ~3-4% of the observed range of partition coefficients. These patterns of behavior are consistent with the observed miscibility gap between the Al, Cr spinel group end members and ulvospinel and magnetite. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Background: Adenylosuccinate lyase is an enzyme that plays a critical role in both cellular replication and metabolism via its action in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. Adenylosuccinate lyase is the only enzyme in this pathway to catalyze two separate reactions, enabling it to participate in the addition of a nitrogen at two different positions in adenosine monophosphate. Both reactions catalyzed by adenylosuccinate lyase involve the \u03b2-elimination of fumarate. Enzymes that catalyze this type of reaction belong to a superfamily, the members of which are homotetramers. Because adenylosuccinate lyase plays an integral part in maintaining proper cellular metabolism, mutations in the human enzyme can have severe clinical consequences, including mental retardation with autistic features. Results: The 1.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of adenylosuccinate lyase from Thermotoga maritima has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion using the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme. The fold of the monomer is reminiscent of other members of the \u03b2-elimination superfamily. However, its active tetrameric form exhibits striking differences in active-site architecture and cleft size. Conclusions: This first structure of an adenylosuccinate lyase reveals that, along with the catalytic base (His141) and the catalytic acid (His68), Gln212 and Asn270 might play a vital role in catalysis by properly orienting the succinyl moiety of the substrates. We propose a model for the dual activity of adenylosuccinate lyase: a single 180\u00b0 bond rotation must occur in the substrate between the first and second enzymatic reactions. Modeling of the pathogenic human S413P mutation indicates that the mutation destabilizes the enzyme by disrupting the C- terminal extension.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: Epoxide hydrolases have important roles in the defense of cells against potentially harmful epoxides. Conversion of epoxides into less toxic and more easily excreted diols is a universally successful strategy. A number of microorganisms employ the same chemistry to process epoxides for use as carbon sources. Results: The X-ray structure of the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger was determined at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method, and then refined at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution. There is a dimer consisting of two 44 kDa subunits in the asymmetric unit. Each subunit consists of an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold, and a primarily helical lid over the active site. The dimer interface includes lid- lid interactions as well as contributions from an N-terminal meander. The active site contains a classical catalytic triad, and two tyrosines and a glutamic acid residue that are likely to assist in catalysis. Conclusions: The Aspergillus enzyme provides the first structure of an epoxide hydrolase with strong relationships to the most important enzyme of human epoxide metabolism, the microsomal epoxide hydrolase. Differences in active-site residues, especially in components that assist in epoxide ring opening and hydrolysis of the enzyme-substrate intermediate, might explain why the fungal enzyme attains the greater speeds necessary for an effective metabolic enzyme. The N-terminal domain that is characteristic of microsomal epoxide hydrolases corresponds to a meander that is critical for dimer formation in the Aspergillus enzyme.",

The extension entails two main components. First, a form of persistence for the position signal based on the temporal impulse response function of the visual system. Secondly, we hypothesise that the perceived relative position of two objects is determined by a slow average of the difference of the objects' position signals. The model explains why briefly flashed static dots are perceived to lag behind continuously visible moving dots, without the need for a motion extrapolation process [Nijhawan, R. (1994). Nature, 370, 256-257]. The dependence of this illusion on parameters such as the velocity, duration, frequency and number of flashes of the motion trajectories is accurately captured by the model. Furthermore, the model makes two predictions. First, briefly flashed dots on a staircase trajectory should lead dots with a long duration. Secondly, it should be possible to abolish the lag-effect between continuously visible and stroboscopically moving objects by halting the continuously visible dots during the interflash interval of the stroboscopic dots. Both predictions are corroborated in experiments. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

After characterizing males of the progenitor and RQI strains for variations in ethanol preference, we scanned their genome for polymorphisms at 244 dinucleotide-repeat marker loci known to differ between B6 and C. Because of the introgression of BALB/c-type QTLs onto the B6 background, some strains showed ethanol preference significantly lower or higher than that of the background strain, suggesting that genetic interaction between ethanol preference QTLs and the background can be operative. The genomic region showing the strongest influence on ethanol preference was on mouse chromosome 15, and corresponds to human chr.12 q11-q13. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "High-resolution, three-dimensional, compressional and shear wave velocity models, derived from microearthquake traveltimes, are used to map the distribution of Poisson's ratio and porosity at Coso Geothermal Area, Inyo County, California. Spatial resolution of the three-dimensional Poisson's ratio and porosity distributions is estimated to be 0.5 km horizontally and 0.8 km vertically. Model uncertainties, \u00b11% in the interior and \u00b12.3% around the edge of the model, are estimated by a jackknife method. We use perturbations of r = V(p)/V(s) ratio and \u03a8 = V(p) \u00b7 V(s) product to derive distributions of Poisson's ratio, \u03c3, and porosity, which are then used to constrain and delineate possible zones of intense heat, fracture accumulation and fluid saturation. Poisson's ratio at Coso ranges from 0.15 to 0.35 with an average of 0.224, lower than the crustal average of 0.25. High Poisson's ratios are more extensive in shallower depths (<1.5 km) while lower Poisson's ratios are found in the deeper section (1.5-3.0 km) of the target area. Two major features with low Poisson's ratio are identified at geothermal production depth (1-3 km) around stations S2-S6 and S1-S3-S4. The two low-\u03c3 features are separated by a northwest-southeast-trending high-\u03c3 belt with variable width of 1-3 km. A high-\u03a8 body is found around S2 and S6, and extends down in depth. A circular, low-\u03a8 belt corresponding to the high-\u03c3 belt, is located around S2-S6 and is linked to a previously reported structure in V(s) tomography. This low-\u03a8 (highly porous) belt is probably a horizontal conduit/reservoir of geothermal fluid. A vertical, low-\u03c3 and high-\u03a8 channel beneath triangle S1-S3-S4 corresponds to a high-attenuation, dome-like feature. We propose an upwell-and-spread magma intrusion model for the last major magmatism in the Coso region. The magmatic upwelling is centered in the S1-S3-S4 area. The model predicts potential geothermal resources to the south and west of triangle S1-S3-S4 based on local faulting patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

These data support the notion of an increasing pH dependent self-assembly process involving the deprotonation of the \u03b1-NH3 +. The self-assembled amphiphilic monomers formed rod or plate-like fibres that possess widths of a few microns and lengths ranging from tens to hundreds of microns when measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to polymerize the monomers in these self-assembled structures. The kinetics of enzymatic polymerization were not second order above the c.m.c., supporting the model of self-assembled aggregates being the existing solution structure. SEM provided evidence that enzymatic polymerization left the gross shape and diameter dimensions of the fibres unaltered. However, polymerization allowed the existence of much longer fibres, hundred of microns in length, in contrast to the shorter length fibres observed before polymerization. These data suggest that the polymerized fibres are more robust mechanical structures than unpolymerized fibres. Also, these data suggest that there is little difference in macro-scale self-assembly structure due to isomer differences or to polymerization. However, polymerized fibres possessed a smooth outer surface, in contrast to the rougher often fibrillar surface of the unpolymerized self-assembled fibre structures. This suggests a difference in the micro-scale molecular organization of the fibre monomer units prior to and following polymerization.",

It is the underlying principle for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation on substances used in food-contact articles. Further to this, the principle of Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) has been developed and is now used by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in their evaluations. Establishing an accepted TTC would benefit consumers, industry and regulators, since it would preclude extensive toxicity evaluations when human intakes are below such threshold, and direct considerable time and cost resources towards testing substances with the highest potential risk to human health. It was questioned, however, whether specific endpoints that may potentially give rise to low-dose effects would be covered by such threshold. In this review, the possibility of defining a TTC for chemical substances present in the diet was examined for general toxicity endpoints (including carcinogenicity), as well as for specific endpoints, namely neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity and developmental toxicity. For each of these endpoints, a database of specific no-observed-effect levels (NOELs) was compiled by screening oral toxicity studies. The substances recorded in each specific database were selected on the basis of their demonstrated adverse effects. For the neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity databases, it was intended to cover all classes of compounds reported to have either a demonstrated neurotoxic or developmentally neurotoxic effect, or at least, on a biochemical or pharmacological basis were considered to have a potential for displaying such effects. For the immunotoxicity endpoint, it was ensured that only immunotoxicants were included in the database by selecting most of the substances from the Luster et al. database, provided that they satisfied the criteria for immunotoxicity defined by Luster. For the developmental toxicity database, substances were selected from the Munro et al. database that contained the lowest NOELs retrieved from the literature for more than 600 compounds. After screening these, substances showing any effect which could point to developmental toxicity as broadly defined by the US were recorded in the database. Additionally, endocrine toxicity and allergenicity were addressed as two separate cases, using different approaches and methodology. The distributions of NOELs for the neurotoxicity, developmental neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity endpoints were compared with the distribution of NOELs for non- specific carcinogenic endpoints. As the immunotoxicity database was too limited to draw such a distribution of immune NOELs, the immunotoxicity endpoint was evaluated by comparing immune NOELs (or LOELs - lowest-observed- effect levels - when NOELs were not available) with non-immune NOELs (or LOELs), in order to compare the sensitivity of this endpoint with non- specific endpoints. A different methodology was adopted for the evaluation of the endocrine toxicity endpoint since data currently available do not permit the establishment of a clear causal link between endocrine active chemicals and adverse effects in humans. Therefore, this endpoint was analysed by estimating the human exposure to oestrogenic environmental chemicals and evaluating their potential impact on human health, based on their contribution to the overall exposure, and their estrogenic potency relative to endogenous hormones. The allergenicity endpoint was not analysed as such. It was addressed in a separate section because this issue is not relevant to the overall population but rather to subsets of susceptible individuals, and allergic risks are usually controlled by other means (i.e. labelling) than the Threshold of Toxicological Concern approach. However, as several researchers are currently examining the existence of a threshold in allergy, the possibility of determining threshold doses for food allergens was put into perspective, and the likelihood for chemical substances to induce allergy at dietary relevant doses was discussed. The analysis indicated that, within the limitation of the databases, developmental neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity were not more sensitive than other non-specific endpoints. Although the cumulative distribution of NOELs for neurotoxic compounds was significantly lower than those for other non-cancer endpoints, these substances were accommodated within the TTC of 1.5\u03bcg/person/day. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that none of the specific non-cancer endpoints evaluated in the present study was more sensitive than cancer and, that a TTC of 1.5\u03bcg/person/day based on cancer endpoints provides an adequate margin of safety. Analysis of the immunotoxicity database showed that for the group of immunotoxicants examined here, the specific immunotoxic endpoint was not more sensitive than other endpoints. In other words, the distribution of immunotoxic NOELs for these compounds did not appear to differ from the distribution of non-specific endpoints NOELs for the same compounds. The dietary intakes of environmental oestrogenic chemicals were estimated and their oestrogenic potencies were compared with that of endogenous hormones, in order to assess their impact on human health. The results are in line with scientific data obtained so far, suggesting that estrogenic compounds of anthropogenic origin, in comparison with endogenous hormones, possess only little hormonal activity like phytoestrogens. Results of animal studies do not suggest that hormonal effects are to be expected from the rather low concentrations found in foods. More data are necessary to determine threshold doses for food allergens. However, provided that numerous criteria need to be satisfied before sensitization occurs, it is unlikely that small molecules used in little amounts in foods would induce such reactions. On the basis of the present analysis, which was conducted using conservative assumptions at each step of the procedure (i.e. in data compilation and data analysis), and continually adopting a 'worst case' perspective, it can be concluded that a Threshold of Toxicological Concern of 1.5\u03bcg/person/day provides adequate safety assurance. Chemical substances present in the diet that are consumed at levels below this threshold pose no appreciable risk. Moreover, for compounds which do not possess structural alerts for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, further analysis may indicate that a higher Threshold of Toxicological Concern may be appropriate.

        "Absrtact": "During late September 1996, a major eruption took place at the NW part of the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in central Iceland. The eruption was preceded by intense seismic activity, which began with a Mw = 5.6 earthquake two days previously. Two very active volcanic systems, B\u00e1rdarbunga and Grimsv\u00f6tn, are situated in that area underneath the permanent ice cap. The volcanoseismic phenomena associated with the eruption were recorded on both temporary (HOTSPOT) and permanent (SIL) seismic networks, covering most parts of the country. The recorded events were categorised, according to their waveform shape and frequency content, into three groups: (1) low-frequency events; (2) mixed-frequency events; and (3) volcanic tremor. The large earthquake at B\u00e1rdarbunga volcano, which initiated the seismic activity before the eruption, was located inside the caldera and had the characteristics of a non-double couple event. The epicentres of the earthquake swarm that followed it initially delineated the caldera rim and then migrated towards Grimsv\u00f6tn, possibly indicating lateral movements of magma from a shallow chamber beneath B\u00e1rdarbunga. The eruption affected an area much larger than that between these two volcanoes, since seismic activity was also observed at distances 20 km away, at the Tindafjallaj\u00f6kull volcanic system. The spectral analysis of tremor, recorded at the nearest station to the eruption site, revealed its existence before the onset of the eruption in five narrow frequency bands (0.5-0.7, 1.6, 2.2, 2.8, 3.2 Hz) representing fundamental frequencies with their half- and quarter-subharmonics. This pattern continued until the last day of the eruption. It is believed that the eruption was caused by a dyke injection that had been going on beneath the Vatnaj\u00f6kull area for a period of 10 years. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model uses settling velocities calculated for three dominant silt modes (23, 28 and 41 \u03bcm) and measured tidal current data to predict the headward transport of silt by a large flood tide. Modelling was aided by the use of Wind and Currents 2000 (WC2000) freeware, a visualisation and analysis tool for vectorial data. The model predicts the 23, 28 and 41 \u03bcm modes will be transported minimum headward distances of 1250, 950 and 500 m, respectively and compares well with the observed silt distribution on the bed. The results indicate that under fair-weather conditions flood-tides control the distribution of silt. Consistent grain size trends of bulk and siliciclastic silt implies that siliciclastic and carbonate silt-sized grains may exhibit similar hydraulic behaviour during transport by flood tides in Nara Inlet. The model may be applied to embayments where fine sediment transport is dominated by flood tides. It may also have application in identifying the controls on dispersal and accumulation of particle-associated contaminants in embayments characterised by mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sediments.

        "Absrtact": "Side-scan sonar records reveal that the crestlines of megaripples in the troughs as well as on both sides of the slopes of sand waves form an angle with the crestline of the sand waves itself. The existence of such an angle between the crestline of megaripples and sand waves indicates that changes of the (tidal) current direction across sand waves can be expected. Direct evidence that such (tidal) current direction changes occur above sand waves is derived from measurements of the Air-Sea Interaction Drift Buoy (ASIB) system at the sea surface and from side-scan sonar records of the sea bed. Both systems were operated from on board research vessels during two C-STAR field experiments in the Hoek van Holland study area off the Dutch coast in April 1996 and in April 1997. Measurements performed by electrical resistance wires on board the ASIB system indicate that variations of the short and moderate wave direction and the wave directional spread are associated with changes of the (tidal) current direction at the sea surface. According to the results of the measurements derived from the ASIB system and the side-scan sonar records it can be summarised that the variation of the direction of short and moderate period water waves as well as changes of the (tidal) current speed and direction across large sand waves must be considered for correct modelling of the wave-current interaction mechanism.

By training a counterpropagation network with coded 3D structures and IR spectra it is possible to simulate the structure code of a query spectrum. To obtain an initial structure, the simulated code is compared with structure codes generated from a database of over 100,000 molecules. The molecule with the most similar structure code defines the so-called initial model for the 3D structure. By means of stochastic methods, this initial structure is modified in various ways to gain the best similarity with the structure code from the neural network. Thus, information from infrared spectra can be used to generate the corresponding 3D structure. The scopes and limitations of the method will be discussed with different examples of compounds using experimental IR spectra from various applications. The intention of this method is to assist in the interpretation of IR spectra and in structure elucidation in routine analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The in vivo rodent micronucleus assay (MNC) is widely used as a cytogenetic assay to detect the clastogenic activity of a chemical in vivo. MNC is one of three tests in a battery recommended by the fourth International Conference on Harmonization (ICH4) of Genotoxicity Guidelines. As such it has been accepted by many regulatory authorities. However, the determination of a positive result in a genotoxicity test, including MNC, has been an issue of debate among toxicologists and biometricians. In this presentation we compare several statistical procedures that have been suggested for the analysis of MNC data and indicate which one is the most powerful. The standard protocol of MNC has at least three dose levels plus the control dose and uses at least four animals per group. For each animal, 2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) are counted. Two statistical procedures can be employed, either alone or jointly, for the analysis of the MNC dose-response curve. These are the Cochran-Armitage (C-A) trend test and the Dunnett type test. For performing Dunnett type tests, toxicologists often use negative historical control rate for the estimate of the concurrent negative control rate. Some toxicologists emphasize the reproducibility of assay results instead of the dose-response relationship for the important criterion [J. Ashby, H. Tinwell, Mutat. Res. 327 (1995) 49-55; for the rebuttal see M. Hayashi, T. Sofuni, Mutat. Res. 331 (1995) 173-174]. The following three procedures are currently employed in toxicology labs for the evaluation of MNC result. The assay response is deemed positive if it is detected by (i) the C-A trend test alone, (ii) both the C-A trend test and the Dunnett type test and (iii) either the C-A trend test or the Dunnett type test. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we first find for each procedure, sizes of tests which yield the experiment-wise type I error rate of 0.05 and show that the procedure (ii) is the most powerful against the alternatives of monotone increase. The procedure (ii) which originated from Hayashi's three-step procedure was coded in C and termed 'MNC'. The MNC software program is available in the public domain through the ftp.

Abiotic damage (wind, snow, frost or edaphic factors) was present on 8.4% of forest land, on 1.68 million hectares during 1986-1994. It decreased the silvicultural quality of the stand in 5.2% of forest land. Abiotic damage was more frequent in northern than in southern Finland. Especially snow damage was important in northern Finland in Scots pine stands. The defoliation of conifers and various damage forms showed significant co-occurrence. Temporal and spatial patterns were evident in the occurrence and importance of different causal agents. Abiotic damage increased the defoliation in Picea abies more than in Pinus sylvestris, but in the latter species the damage was locally more severe. Sudden changes in defoliation were related to abiotic and biotic damage, and the effect of these injuries can be so remarkable that they mask the possible trend in defoliation. The analysis of these injuries may aid monitoring of forest condition by simplifying interpretation of national and regional patterns of forest damage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

There was also no significant between-group difference when the ~7% smaller forebrain volume among children with DLD was accounted for by relating CC measures to forebrain volume. Only a tendency towards a larger anterior and middle CC in relation to forebrain volume was found in DLD children.

        "Absrtact": "Global epicentre maps show that the majority of earthquakes are inter-plate, although moderate to large earthquakes do occur intra-plate, i.e. within the plates. The seismicity of the Australian continent is typical of intra-plate environments and a magnitude ML 6 earthquake has an average return period of about 5 years. Recordings of Australian intra-plate earthquakes are investigated here to characterise their frequency content, peak acceleration and duration. Due to lack of quality strong motion records of large intra-plate earthquakes at short distances, synthetic seismograms are commonly used for testing structural behaviour. An empirical Green's Function method (Geophys. Res. Lett. 5 (1978), 1-4: Proceedings of the Third International Microzonation Conference, Seattle, USA. vol. 1. (1982). pp. 447-458.) is chosen to simulate a large earthquake by summation in time of a number of smaller earthquakes or sub-events, each given a slightly different origin time to represent more realistically the propagation of a rupture along an assumed fault plane. In the first instance, recordings on rock of the magnitude ML 2.3 aftershock of the 29 December 1989 Newcastle earthquake were used as sub-events to simulate the main shock of magnitude ML 5.6. Validation studies for events recorded elsewhere in Australia are also considered. The response spectra of such synthetic events will be compared with the recommended spectra developed empirically from a statistical analysis of strong motion data for magnitude 5.4-6.5 intra-plate earthquakes recorded in other parts of the world and normalised to a peak ground velocity of 50 mm/s which is typical for a return period of 500 years in Australia (Australasian Structural Engineering Conference, Auckland. New Zealand. (1998). pp. 439-444.). Preliminary results from this comparison with the response spectra recommended for the Building Code of Australia show that the synthetic waveforms produced by this method are realistic and can be used to represent ground motion during typical Australian intra-plate earthquakes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Background Left ventricular ejection fraction is an important prognostic variable after acute myocardial infarction. Although infarct size is known to affect the subsequent global left ventricular ejection fraction, it remains unclear whether other factors such as site or severity of the wall motion abnormality influence the ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction. Methods: Sixty-nine consecutive patients (mean age 61 \u00b1 14 years, 46 [67%] male) who did not receive thrombolytic therapy or undergo early revascularization were studied by echocardiography 1 week after Q-wave myocardial infarction. The absolute size of the region of abnormal wall motion (AWM) and the percentage of the endocardium involved (%AWM) were quantitated along with the wall motion score. A severity index was then derived as the mean wall motion score within the region of AWM. Site of myocardial infarction was classified as either anterior or inferior from the endocardial map. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by Simpson's method with 2 apical views. Results: Twenty-nine (42%) patients had anterior and 40 had inferior myocardial infarction. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in anterior than in inferior myocardial infarction (44.8% \u00b1 11.5% vs 53% \u00b1 8.6%; P = .001). The mean %AWM was greater in anterior than in inferior myocardial infarction (32.1 \u00b1 15.5 vs 22.4 \u00b1 14.1; P = .01). The mean wall motion score was greater in anterior than in inferior myocardial infarction (9.8 \u00b1 6.4 vs 6.4 \u00b1 4.4; P = .01). The mean severity index did not differ by site. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that, in descending order of importance, %AWM, extent of apical involvement, and site of myocardial infarction were independent determinants of global left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusions: For myocardial infarctions of similar size, left ventricular ejection fraction is lower when apical involvement is extensive and the site of infarction is anterior. This site-dependent difference may be related to characteristics specific to the apex.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: Restenosis complicates 30% to 40% of angioplasty procedures and may be unrelated to traditional coronary risk factors. Homocysteine, lipoprotein(a), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677T) (a genetic determinant of plasma homocysteine concentrations) are novel risk factors for coronary artery disease. Their roles in restenosis are unclear, and the potential synergism between homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) has not previously been studied. The objective of this study was to determine the relations among homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), MTHFR 677T, and restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Methods: This prospective study enrolled patients with successful elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting of a single, de novo, native coronary lesion. Fasting blood was drawn the morning of the procedure for homocysteine, lipoprotein(a), and MTHFR 677T. Follow-up angiography was performed 6 months after the procedure or earlier if clinically indicated. All cineangiograms were analyzed quantitatively. Results: A total of 144 (92%) of 156 eligible patients underwent follow-up coronary angiography. The overall angiographic restenosis rate (residual stenosis >50%) was 31%. Mean homocysteine concentration was 10.1 \u00b1 3.7 \u03bcmol/L. Plasma homocysteine concentrations were not significantly different in patients with or without angiographic restenosis (9.6 \u00b1 3.3 vs 10.3 \u00b1 3.8 \u03bcmol/L; P = .31). Mean lipoprotein(a) concentration was 21.2 \u00b1 20.1 mg/dL. Plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations were not significantly different in patients with or without restenosis (21.9 \u00b1 21.8 vs 20.9 \u00b1 19.5 mg/dL). Homozygosity for MTHFR 677T was present in 6.5% and was not associated with increased restenosis. No interaction between homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) was detected. Conclusions: Homocysteine, lipoprotein(a), and MTHFR 677T are not associated with restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.",

Setting: Population-based sample of IVF-ET cycles initiated in U.S. clinics, 1996.Patient(s): The IVF-ET (n = 35,503) cycles and 11,247 resultant pregnancies. Intervention(s): Use of an assisted hatching procedure on embryos transferred. Main Outcome Measure(s): Cases were pregnancies for which number of fetal hearts observed on ultrasound exceeded number of embryos transferred. These pregnancies were considered to contain at least one MZ set of twins. Cases were compared with two control groups: other multiple-gestation pregnancies (\u22652 fetal hearts but number of fetal hearts \u2264 number of embryos transferred); and singleton pregnancies (1 fetal heart).Result(s): Women with a case pregnancy were more likely to have received embryos treated with assisted hatching procedures than were women in either control group. After adjustment for patient age, number of embryos transferred, prior cycles, infertility diagnosis, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and whether embryos from the current cycle were cryopreserved for later use, odds ratios and 95% CIs for use of assisted hatching were 3.2 (1.2-8.0), compared with other multiple-gestation pregnancies, and 3.8 (1.8-9.8), compared with singleton pregnancies.

        "Absrtact": "Crop performance in rainfed cropping systems generally is dependent on rainfall amount and distribution. The objective of this study was to analyze the long-term consequences of rainfall expressed as a standardized precipitation index (SPI) and fertilizer nitrogen (N) on yields and risk probabilities of maize in the udic-ustic moisture regimes in the Great Plains in Nebraska. The SPI is a precipitation index for classifying drought stress conditions. The study was conducted on a Kennebec silt loam (Cumulic Hapludoll) over an 11-year period, 1986-1996, using monoculture maize (Zea mays L.) and maize in rotation with soybean (Glycine max.(L.) Merr.) in combination with N fertilizer levels between 0 and 160 kg ha-1. Maize yields in monoculture ranged from 4.8 to 5.7 Mg ha-1, and from 6.4 to 6.8 Mg ha-1 in rotation. The differences in yields between monoculture and rotation were larger at low N rates and decreased as N fertilizer increased above 40 kg ha-1. Current year's maize yields either exhibited a weak or no response to N fertilizer in years when the preceding preseason (October-April) and the previous growing season (May-August) were dry (negative SPI value). Regression of yield as the dependent variable and the 12-month April SPI as the independent variable explained up to 64% of yield variability in a curvilinear relationship. Optimum SPI values were in the range of -1.0 to 1.0, substantiating the adaptability and performance of crops under mild stress as proposed by other scientists. Prediction of subsequent yields using past SPI data was relatively better in rotations (R2=41-50%) than in monoculture (R2=15-40%). Risk, calculated as the lower confidence limit of maize returns over variable cost of fertilizer, was less in rotations than in monoculture, and in both cropping systems returns were maximized with the application of N fertilizer at 40 kg ha-1. Used with other criteria, the SPI can be a practical guide to choice of crops, N levels, and management decisions to conserve water in rainfed systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Hip dysplasia (malformation of the coxofemoral joint) in dogs is a major health problem for which the British Veterinary Association (BVA) had set up a control scheme in 1965. Based on scoring nine components of the radiographs of both the left and right joints, the degree of hip joint malformation is now quantified by an overall hip score (a measure of the condition of the hip joint). The hip scores of 1258 flat-coated retrievers and 1566 Newfoundlands (registered with The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom) were analysed after merging with Kennel Club pedigree data for 19 036 flat-coated retrievers registered by 1995 and 14 336 Newfoundlands registered by 1997. The merged data included the animal's identity, date of birth, sex and hip scores and also similar records for the dog's relatives including the hip score if the relative had been tested. In recent years, breeding has been increasingly from tested parents. There has been some reduction in offspring hip scores - presumably because breeders avoided breeding from males with very high scores. However, a much greater reduction in offspring hip score would be achieved by stricter science-based selection of potential sires and dams. Regression modelling quantified the positive relationship between offspring and parental hip scores. The genetic heritability of hip scores was large and significant in both breeds (particularly from dams). The breeders in UK tended to use healthy sires for breeding but they have taken less care in selecting dams. Our regression models emphasise the need for both sires and dams, particularly dams, to be healthy with very small hip scores. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Utilizing these improvements to the hardware infrastructure, software enhancements are focusing on streamlined analysis, automation, and graphical user interface (GUI) systems to enlarge the user base. The adoption of the load balancing software package LSF Suite by Platform Computing has dramatically increased the availability of CPU cycles and the efficiency of their use. Streamlined analysis has been aided by the adoption of the MDSplus system to provide a unified interface to analyzed DIII-D data. The majority of MDSplus data is made available in between pulses giving the researcher critical information before setting up the next pulse. Work on data viewing and analysis tools focuses on efficient GUI design with object-oriented programming (OOP) for maximum code flexibility. Work to enhance the computational infrastructure at DIII-D has included a significant effort to aid the remote collaborator since the DIII-D National Team consists of scientists from nine national laboratories, 19 foreign laboratories, 16 universities, and five industrial partnerships. As a result of this work, DIII-D data is available on a 24\u00d77 basis from a set of viewing and analysis tools that can be run on either the collaborators' or DIII-D's computer systems. Additionally, a web based data and code documentation system has been created to aid the novice and expert user alike.",

Assay procedures are needed to ensure that the proportion of each component is within a small percentage (usually 10 relative percent or less) of the target concentration. One such etchant class contains chromium trioxide, usually in combination with HF and HNO3. While several ion-chromatographic columns can be used to analyze most mineral acids, chromium(VI) presents a problem. This latter species is highly retained by many separators and may also degrade the resins. This paper compares two columns that showed potential for success with these assays: the AS11 and the AS16 separators (both from Dionex). These columns permit elution of chromium(VI) as chromate in 25 min or less. A representative mixture of HF, HNO3 and CrO3 was used in the research. Simultaneous calibration studies were conducted and the data sets analyzed statistically. Also investigated was the effect on the columns of repeated exposure to chromate.

Shell sections of dog cockles collected from four areas subjected to varying levels of fishing disturbance were examined for the presence of damage records or shell 'scars'. Animals from a heavily fished area had significantly higher levels of scarring than those from three lightly fished areas. From an estimation of the age of the shells (from internal growth lines and dating of each line), the year in which scarring occurred was determined and this was compared to yearly records of fishing effort. There was a weak but significant positive correlation between the frequency of shell scars per year and the intensity of fishing effort. Our data suggest that whilst scarring in shells of G. glycymeris cannot accurately be used to estimate past fishing intensity on a year-by-year basis, it can be used to differentiate between severely impacted and lightly fished areas of the sea bed.

Despite the complexity and intractable nature of these plant biopolyesters, their molecular structure and development are amenable to study by suitable solid-state and solution-state NMR techniques. Interactions of tomato cutin with water were examined by solid-state 2H and 13C NMR, showing that water films enhance rapid segmental motions of the acyl chains and are associated with a fivefold increase in surface elasticity upon cutin hydration. The suberization of wounded potato tissues was studied by solid-state 13C NMR, revealing the likely phenylpropanoid structures that permit dense cross-linking of the suberin structure and their proximity to the cell-wall polysaccharides. Finally, two new approaches were developed to elucidate the molecular structures of these biopolymers: partial depolymerization followed by spectroscopic analysis of the soluble oligomers; and swelling of the intact materials followed by magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR analysis. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Paper birch, which formed the dominant overstory following the 1961 fire, had normal distributions of height and diameter classes. Subalpine fir, which dominated the understory, had the reverse J-shaped height and diameter distributions that are expected of a shade tolerant, climax species. Paper birch grew more than three times the height of subalpine fir. Growing in the summer shade of the birch, subalpine fir had slow but steady height growth during the first 10-15 years, after which height growth declined somewhat. Allometric equations, relating dry weight of foliage, branches, stemwood, stembark, roots, and total biomass to diameter at breast height (DBH), were developed to estimate above- and below-ground biomass. Total biomass of paper birch reached 83.2 t ha-1, while subalpine fir biomass was 26.7 t ha-1. Subalpine fir allocated more biomass to foliage and branches compared to paper birch. Foliage of paper birch had higher nutrient concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg than subalpine fir foliage. Branches and stembark of subalpine fir had higher P, and Ca concentrations than paper birch. Subalpine fir branches contained more of all examined nutrients than paper birch branches. This is a significant component in nutrient cycling of the mixed-species forest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that are mediators of the action of lipophilic hormones and other endogenous ligands and are the targets of drugs useful in a variety of therapeutic areas. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3 is a nuclear receptor that, acting as a heterodimer with RXR, mediates a variety of cellular effects including adipocyte-differentiation. Due to its role in modulating insulin sensitivity, it is the target of therapeutically active anti-diabetic agents such as rosiglitazone. We have assigned the chemical shifts of the backbone atoms of the 32 kDa ligand-binding domain of PPAR\u03b3 in the presence of bound rosiglitazone. Three-dimensional HNCO spectra of the apo ligand-binding domain (LBD) have less than half the expected number of cross-peaks. The missing cross-peaks are restored upon binding strong agonists such as rosiglitazone. The NMR results indicate that the apo-LBD of PPAR\u03b3 is in a conformationally mobile state, and that agonist binding is associated with a marked stabilization of the conformation. Mapping the missing peaks to the 3D X-ray crystallographic structure indicates the region of mobility is extensive and includes the ligand-binding region and the cofactor-binding site. This leads to the conclusion that activation of this nuclear receptor is a result of a population shift of a dynamic ensemble of conformations, rather than a two-state switch from an inactive to an active conformation. Our results have important implications for the mechanisms by which antagonists, partial agonists, and agonists of nuclear receptor function operate. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

One of the most important pieces of information is the variation with height in leaf area density, p (m2 leaf area per m3 canopy volume), but it is notoriously difficult to measure this in forest canopies. Consequently, very few data on p exist for tall tropical forests. We describe a relatively rapid photographic method to make this measurement and we demonstrate its use for a rain forest in Cameroon, and two rain forests in Brazil. The method requires an assumption or knowledge of leaf angle distribution, but is relatively rapid and has the benefit of sampling a relatively large volume of canopy. The technique works adequately, especially if the leaf area index of the site is already known; the results agree quantitatively and qualitatively with previous more laborious determinations.

The Salmonella status of the house after cleansing and disinfection, was assessed from gauze-swab samples taken from the walls, feeders, ventilation system and bedding (analysed with classical bacteriological methods). Thirty three (38%) houses had at least one contaminated sample and were classified as Salmonella-contaminated houses in the logistic regression. The absence of a terminal disinfection and a disinfection procedure performed by the farm staff rather than a contractor were positively related to the Salmonella contamination of the house after cleansing and disinfection. The risk for Salmonella persistence after decontamination was increased if rodents were observed by the farmer, if a large part of the access area to the house was accessible to trucks, and if a disease leading to a treatment occurred in the previous flock.

        "Absrtact": "Mitochondrial energy production requires complex interactions among proteins encoded in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The intergenomic coevolution of interacting gene products has been previously suggested based on interspecific comparisons of cytochrome c (encoded by the nuclear CYC gene) and cytochrome c oxidase (partly encoded in the mitochondrial DNA by the COX1, COX2 and COX3 genes). In the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus californicus, non-synonymous substitutions in the COX1 gene have previously been found in interpopulation comparisons. In order to determine if CYC also shows interpopulation variation, this gene was isolated from a cDNA library using a degenerate primer/polymerase chain reaction approach. Characterization of a cDNA sequence and 25 genomic DNA sequences derived from four T. californicus populations yielded the following results: (1) the T. californicus CYC gene is interrupted by an intron that occurs at the same position as the intron found in vertebrate CYC genes; (2) there is extensive sequence variation within both the coding region and intron of this gene and the vast majority of this variation occurs between sequences drawn from geographically distinct populations; (3) the coding sequence variation includes a minimum of five amino acid replacement substitutions; (4) segregation of length variants among offspring in an interpopulation cross revealed genotypic ratios consistent with the proposed allelic nature of the CYC variants. These results demonstrate that the requisite genetic variation required for intergenomic coevolution exists in the CYC-COX system in T. californicus. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A consistent weld, free from defects, is the key to process success. Typical welding defects have been synthesised in order to investigate, and consequently remove, their cause.

Growing human populations are placing increasing demands for new lands for agricultural production. At the same time, there is a need to maintain or increase our forest cover for biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Unfortunately, our land base is limited. Consequently, there is strong competition between those lands will be used for forestry and those that will be used for agriculture. Current assessments of agriculture and forested lands are often carried out by separate entities. Often, there is duplication of data collection, information gaps, etc. The bottom line is that we do not really know how much land currently serves the needs of agriculture and forestry, which lands are best suited for conversion to alternate use, and where they are located. In order for decision makers to make more informed decisions, we need complete and up-to-date geo-referenced inventories. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problems of separate resource inventories and to present ways to overcome these problems by integrated assessments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify significant independent predictors of inpatient mortality rates for pediatric victims of blunt trauma and to develop a formula for predicting the probability of inpatient mortality for these patients. Methods: Emergency department and inpatient data from 2,923 pediatric victims of blunt injury in the New York State Trauma Registry in 1994 and 1995 were used to explore the relationship between patient risk factors and mortality rate. A stepwise logistic regression model with P < .05 was developed using survival status as the dependent variable. Independent variables included are elements of the Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS), additional elements from the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), the motor response and eye opening components of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), age-specific systolic blood pressure, the AVPU score, and 2 measures of anatomic injury severity (the Injury Severity Score [ISS] and the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision-based Injury Severity Score [ICISS]). Results: The only significant independent predictors of severity that emerged were the ICISS, no motor response (best motor response = 1) from the GCS, and the unresponsive component from the AVPU score. The statistical model exhibited an excellent fit (C statistic = .964). The specificity associated with the prediction of inpatient mortality rate based on the presence of 1 or more of these risk factors was .926, and the sensitivity was .944. Conclusion: The best independent predictors of inpatient mortality rate for pediatric trauma patients with blunt injuries include variables not specifically contained in the PTS or the RTS: ICISS, no motor response (best motor response = 1) from the GCS, and the unresponsive component of the AVPU score.

This is attributed in particular to their high consumption of the meat and blubber of marine mammals. In the present study, 180 pregnant women and 178 newborn babies were studied, amounting to 36% of the total number of births in the Disko Bay area during 1994-1996. The pesticides found in the highest concentrations in maternal blood were DDE (4.8 \u03bcg/l wet wt.), trans-nonachlor (1.6 \u03bcg/l) and hexachlorobenzene (1.2 \u03bcg/l) while the total concentration of PCB (Aroclor 1260) was 19.1 \u03bcg/l. Calculated on a lipid basis, concentrations were slightly higher in maternal than in cord blood. The mercury concentrations were 16.8 \u03bcg/l in maternal blood and 35.6 \u03bcg/l in cord blood. In a linear regression analysis, the concentrations of organochlorines, mercury and selenium increased with maternal age. Concentrations of mercury and cadmium increased with the consumption of marine mammals, and cadmium was associated with smoking. The contaminants are potentially toxic for several organ systems but the high concentrations of pollutants have so far not been shown to influence health in Greenland.

        "Absrtact": "A series of new RNiSn4 compounds (R = Gd-Tm, Lu) has been synthesized. The crystal structure of LuNiSn4 has been determined. It is a new structure type, described as a commensurate modulated structure with space group Ammm/(ddd) and lattice parameters a = 4.386 angstroms, b = 27.942 angstroms and c = 4.353 angstroms. The other investigated compounds have the same structure. Magnetization was measured in the temperature range 1.5-300 K, and, except for the Dy compound, the resistivity was studied between 4 and 300 K. Moreover, the specific heat of the Er and Lu compounds was studied between 1.2 and 30 K. All compounds with magnetic rare earths order antiferromagnetically below their Neel temperature, which ranges from 3 K (R = Tm) to 27 K (R = Gd). Below TN, metamagnetic transitions are observed. In the compound with Er, the specific heat reveals that, immediately below TN = 8.8 K, there is a second transition at 8.5 K. The intermediate phase is likely a modulated structure.",

The resulting differences in solar broadband radiative fluxes appear to be neglectable. Thus, a stratified gaseous atmosphere seems sufficiently adequate for solar radiative transfer calculations. The reasons for these small differences are basically due to the strong correlation between cloud optical thickness and water vapour density as produced by the cloud model used in this study. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The calculated surface structure is in reasonable agreement with previous plane wave density functional and empirical tight binding calculations but is significantly different to either of the proposed structures based on LEED-IV experiments. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy with the LEED-IV results. The current calculations also reveal that the (001) termination has a significantly higher surface energy than the (100) or (110) surfaces confirming that it is the least stable low index termination of rutile TiO2. Finally, we examine the electronic structure of the relaxed surface and find no evidence for the presence of band gap states as reported in early photoemission experiments and tight binding calculations. The current results suggest that such states will only occur on the defective surface and are likely to be localised Ti3+ states induced by oxygen reduction.",

A HER2-positive status is generally associated with more aggressive disease and a worse prognosis. Furthermore, a positive HER2 status may predict the likelihood of resistance to some conventional therapies, as well as probably being predictive of sensitivity to anthracycline dose intensification. In addition to this prognostic/predictive value, HER2 is a target for specific therapy, with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody therapy available in the USA. This article reviews the different assays used to determine HER2 status, discussing their relative advantages/disadvantages and the need for their standardisation before integration alongside other pathological indices into the clinical management of breast cancer.

        "Absrtact": "Fluid chemistry and the hydraulic regime in a marl formation of the Swiss Alps were studied by a number of techniques. Fluid inclusions record the conditions of maximum burial and regional low-temperature metamorphism, whereas fluid samples and hydraulic tests derived from deep boreholes reflect present-day, near-surface conditions. The characterization of the different types of fluids places constraints on the geochemical and hydraulic evolution of low-permeability argillaceous rocks during uplift and exhumation. Fluid inclusions were studied by microthermometry and sampled directly by decrepitation techniques. They contain a two-phase system consisting of an aqueous fluid and a coexisting CH4-rich gas (T= 190-250\u00b0C, P(lith) \u2243 2500 bar). Bulk and isotopic compositions of aqueous fluid inclusions are consistent with a mixture of connate seawater and water derived from the dehydration of clay minerals. Methane was generated in situ by thermal cracking of kerogen. Textural evidence and stable isotopic signatures of carbonates in veins and in the rock matrix indicate local buffering of fluid compositions and very low water/rock ratios. Free fluids residing in the present-day fracture and matrix porosity consist of CH4-saturated Na-Cl groundwater with minute amounts of free CH4 gas which occurs in druses. Their chemical and isotopic compositions are very similar to those of the fluid inclusions, suggesting a common origin. Post-metamorphic admixtures of externally derived waters cannot be identified, and it is suggested that present-day Na-Cl groundwaters that occur in the central parts of the marl have resided in the formation since the time of metamorphism some 20 Ma b.p. The only major change in the fluid composition has been the outgassing of CH4 from the formation, most probably by diffusion. The hydraulic regime during metamorphism was characterized by localized fluid underpressures in open veins because widely scattered, sub-hydrostatic pressures were often identified in fluid inclusions. The central part of the argillaceous rock body, approximately coinciding with the region where Na-Cl groundwaters occur, has sub-hydrostatic pressures today, as indicated by hydraulic tests in deep boreholes. Both the closed-system behavior derived from the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the fluids and the (recurrent or continuous) existence of hydraulic underpressures suggest very low permeabilities of argillaceous rocks during metamorphism and throughout subsequent uplift and exhumation. All fluids present in the central parts of the formation are either connate or produced in situ. Even though major events of brittle faulting and unloading due to uplift occurred since the peak of metamorphism, fluid flow through the formation has been negligible.",

        "Absrtact": "The Colorado Plateau is a distinct physiographic province in western North America, which presently straddles the transition between summer-wet and summer-dry climatic regimes to the south and northwest, respectively. In addition to climate, the diversity of environments and plant communities on the Colorado Plateau has resulted from extreme topographic diversity. Desert lowlands as low as 360 m elevation are surrounded by forested plateaus, and even higher peaks greater than 3800 m elevation. This environmental diversity provides a unique opportunity to study the history of biotic communities in an arid region of North America. Although the Colorado Plateau harbours numerous potential sites, the paleoecological record of the Plateau is poorly known. Potential deposits for analysis include packrat middens, alluvial and cave sites at lower elevations, and lake, bog and wetland sites at higher elevations. Forty-six sites have been analysed across the nearly 337,000 km2 region, of which 27 contain records that span Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (IS) 2 data, with IS 3 information coming from only 12 sites. Most IS 2 and 3 sites are clustered along the lowland regions of the Colorado River corridor and the uplands of the Mogollon Rim area. We compiled selected data from long paleoecological records to examine patterns of vegetation and climate change across the southern Colorado Plateau for the middle and late Wisconsin. During the middle Wisconsin, mixed conifers covered middle-elevations presently dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and juniper (Juniperus) woodland grew at elevations today covered by blackbrush (Coleogyne) and sagebrush (Artemisia) desert. During the late Wisconsin, boreal conifers, primarily Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), replaced the mixed conifer association. Estimates of mean annual temperatures (MAT) during IS 3 were at least 3-4\u00b0C cooler than today, whereas IS 2 MAT estimates are at least 5\u00b0C colder. Our investigation of millennial-scale climatic variability within the region provided equivocal results. The packrat midden sequence could not distinguish vegetation changes that might be associated with Heinrich events in the North Atlantic. From the lake records, however, many Heinrich events were associated with generally drier intervals, often with elevated sagebrush pollen concentrations. Future paleoecological investigations should concentrate on the northern Colorado Plateau, as well as the eastern and western margins. Additional sites, along with closer-spaced sampling in regions already studied, will be important in determining the history of important climatic phenomena such as the timing of the Arizona monsoon.",

        "Absrtact": "New findings of the structure of the crust and the upper mantle across the Dead Sea rift and Israel were obtained by applying P and PKP wave relative travel time residuals inversion of 612 teleseisms, recorded by the seismic networks in Israel and Jordan. Independently of the relative teleseismic travel time residuals, the Bouguer gravity anomalies were used as an additional aid to examine the structure of the crust and upper mantle. An examination of the teleseismic travel time residuals in Israel suggests the existence of two prominent provinces of distinct crustal structure. The northward increase of the teleseismic travel time residuals is in good agreement with a gradual thickening of the sedimentary sequence and a simultaneous thinning of the crust. Examination of the inverted velocity anomalies indicates that the upper and lower crusts are sub-divided into a number of structures. We identify several velocity anomalies that are associated with prominent geological structures. The southern Dead Sea basin is characterized with the largest decrease of velocity, in both upper and lower crustal layers, due to the infilling of light material relative to the surrounding material. The velocity anomaly in the Carmel structure is probably associated with variations in the upper part of the upper mantle. Examination of a cross-section that traverses the Dead Sea transform supports the existence of lighter mass density material on the eastern side relative to that on the western side. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "This paper describes a multi-disciplinary project to examine the changing interactions between trees and crops as the trees in semi-arid agroforestry systems establish and mature; the project is one of the most detailed and highly instrumented long-term studies of tree and crop growth, system performance, resource capture, hydrology and microclimate ever carded out within an agroforestry context. Its primary objective was to compile a comprehensive experimental database to improve the mechanistic understanding of tree/crop interactions and support the development and validation of process-based simulation models describing resource capture and tree and crop growth in semi-arid agroforestry systems. Grevillea robusta A. Cunn. (grevillea) trees were grown as mono-cultures or in mixtures with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) or maize (Zea mays L.) over a 68-month period. Allometric approaches were used to determine seasonal and annual growth increments for leaf area and leaf, branch and trunk biomass in grevillea. Crop performance was examined during each growing season, while the spatial distribution of tree and crop roots was established during the latter stages of the experiment using coring and mini-rhizotron approaches. Detailed hydrological studies examined effects on the soil water balance and its components (precipitation, interception, runoff and soil moisture status); equivalent measurements of spatial and temporal variation in microclimatic conditions allowed the mechanistic basis for beneficial and detrimental effects on understorey crops and the influence of proximity to trees on crop performance to be examined. Transpiration by grevillea and water movement through lateral and tap roots were measured using sap flow methodology, and light interception by the tree and crop canopies was routinely determined. This multi-disciplinary study has provided a detailed understanding of the changing patterns of resource capture by trees and crops as agroforestry systems mature. This paper provides an overview of the underlying rationale, experimental design and core measurements, outlines key results and conclusions, and draws the attention of readers to further papers providing more detailed consideration of specific aspects of the study.

Visible-near infrared (NIR) spectral measurements are used increasingly to monitor fruit properties such as maturity, sensory properties and storability non-destructively both prior to harvest and during storage. To explore this problem, at harvest and after storage, visible-NIR spectra containing 1024 individual data points were measured on kiwifruit berries sourced from six pre-harvest fruit management treatments. These raw spectra were processed by principal component analysis (PCA), or by Fourier, Hartley, Haar, Hurst, range renormalisation or polar coordinate transforms (PCT) in order to extract a smaller set of features selected independently of treatment. In order to reduce their dimensionality further, the extracted features were processed by canonical variate analysis. The ability of various connectionist and linear discrimination pattern recognition models to predict the treatment source of unknown fruit on the basis of these features was evaluated. Thus far, this work has established that the performance of the non-linear model was shown to be significantly better in comparison to the linear model. From these results, it has also been shown that both the feature extraction and selection techniques have a marked effect on the ability to classify fruit by treatment source and storage date. In general, the best classifications were based on features extracted using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method, but the best performance in any single classification was given by the Haar transform (HT) in conjunction with the scaled conjugated gradient learning method.

The structure is folded into NH2-terminal, editing 3'-5' exonuclease, and polymerase domains that are topologically similar to the two other known pol \u03b1 family structures (bacteriophage RB69 and the recently determined Thermococcus gorgonarius), but differ in their relative orientation and conformation. The 9\u00b0N-7 polymerase domain structure is reminiscent of the 'closed' conformation characteristic of ternary complexes of the pol I polymerase family obtained in the presence of their dNTP and DNA substrates. In the apo-9\u00b0N-7 structure, this conformation appears to be stabilized by an ion pair. Thus far, the other apo-pol \u03b1 structures that have been determined adopt open conformations. These results therefore suggest that the pol \u03b1 polymerases undergo a series of conformational transitions during the catalytic cycle similar to those proposed for the pol I family. Furthermore, comparison of the orientations of the fingers and exonuclease (sub)domains relative to the palm subdomain that contains the pol active site suggests that the exonuclease domain and the fingers subdomain of the polymerase can move as a unit and may do so as part of the catalytic cycle. This provides a possible structural explanation for the interdependence of polymerization and editing exonuclease activities unique to pol \u03b1 family polymerases. We suggest that the NH2-terminal domain of 9\u00b0N-7pol may be structurally related to an RNA-binding motif, which appears to be conserved among archaeal polymerases. The presence of such a putative RNA-binding domain suggests a mechanism for the observed autoregulation of bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase synthesis by binding to its own mRNA. Furthermore, conservation of this domain could indicate that such regulation of pol expression may be a characteristic of archaea. Comparion of the 9\u00b0N-7 pol structure to its mesostable homolog from bacteriophage RB69 suggests that thermostability is achieved by shortening loops, forming two disulfide bridges, and increasing electrostatic interactions at subdomain interfaces.

The sapropels are characterized by very high organic carbon contents (up to 30%) which are reported to be the result of both increased productivity and improved preservation. Although the organic matter in the sapropels is mainly of marine origin, the \u03b4 13 C(org) values and C/N ratios appear 'terrestrial'. This is the result of anaerobic organic matter degradation which preferentially removed nitrogen- and 13 C-rich organic components. A comparison with Ti/Al profiles, which mimic the precession index, and a calculation of organic carbon accumulation rates indicate that sedimentation rates were at most 30% lower or at most 50% higher during sapropel formation. Thus, sapropel formation lasted from between 2000 and 10,000 years at Site 964 to between 4500 and 12,000 years at Site 967. A synthesis of new data and a comparison with existing models indicates that productivity, which increased due to extra nutrients supplied as a result of winter mixing and as a result of enhanced input by the Nile, was the driving mechanism behind sapropel formation. The resulting sapropel formation was simultaneous at different depths, but lasted longer in the part of the basin closest to the Nile. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Exon skipping that accompanies exonic mutation might be caused by an effect of the mutation on pre-mRNA secondary structure. Previous attempts to associate predicted secondary structure of pre-mRNA with exon skipping have been hindered by either a small number of available mutations, sub-optimal structures, or weak effects on exon skipping. This report identifies more extensive sets of mutations from the human and hamster Hprt gene whose association with exon skipping is clear. Optimal secondary structures of the wild-type and mutant pre-mRNA surrounding each exon were predicted by energy minimization and were compared by energy dot plots. A significant association was found between the occurrence of exon skipping and the disruption of a stem containing the acceptor site consensus sequences of exon 8 of the human Hprt gene. However, no change in secondary structure was associated with skipping of exon 4 of the hamster Hprt gene. Using updated energy parameters we found a different structure than that previously reported for exon 2 of the hamster Hprt gene. In contrast to the previously reported structure, no significant association was found between predicted structural changes and skipping of exon 2. For all three Hprt exons studied, there was a significantly greater number of deoxythymidine substitutions among mutations accompanied by exon skipping than among mutations without exon skipping. For exon 8, deoxythymidine substitution was also associated with structural changes in the stem containing the acceptor site consensus sequences. For exon 51 of the human fibrillin gene, structural differences from wild type were predicted for all four mutations accompanied by exon skipping that were not were predicted for a single mutation without exon skipping. Our results suggest that both primary and secondary pre-mRNA structure contribute to definition of Hprt exons, which may involve exonic splicing enhancers. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The knowledge of the primordial deuterium to hydrogen ratio provides one of the most reliable tests of the early Universe nucleosynthesis models and a direct estimate of the cosmic baryon density. Evaluations have been traditionally made using D/H estimations in the interstellar medium, extrapolated backwards in time with the use of galactic evolution models. Direct primordial D/H measurements have been carried out only recently in the direction of quasars. These measurements of deuterium abundances along with observations made in the solar system and in the interstellar medium are presented. New results that indicate spatial variations of the deuterium abundance in the interstellar medium at the level of \u223c 50% over scales possibly as small as \u223c 10 pc, may question our global vision of deuterium evolution until the causes for the origin of these variations are understood. With a conservative point of view, observations thus suggest that the primordial D/H value should be within the range 1. \u00d7 10-5 -3. \u00d7 10-4, leading to a relatively low baryon content Universe. Since the actual evolution of deuterium from primordial nucleosynthesis to now is not known in details, more observations, hopefully to be made with the Hubble Space Telescope, FUSE the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (launched in 1999), or from the ground with the largest telescopes (Keck, VLT, ...), should reveal the evolution of that key element, and better constrain its primordial abundance.",

A slightly landward dipping interface revealed at 13 km depth by a single previous line in the channel between Cephalonia and Zante has been suggested as the interplate subduction boundary. New marine multichannel reflection profiles and OBS refraction and wide-angle reflection data confirm the reflector as a regional feature. These data evidence its extension to the south, where large, low-angle thrust earthquakes occur offshore to Zante. The new profiles establish a coincidence between the focal depths of these large subduction events and the imaged bright reflective level, confirming its tentative interpretation as the interplate boundary, which generally appears with a positive reflection polarity. In this context, the Ionian Islands outcrop corresponds to a shallowing of the interplate boundary from south to north. In the south, offshore Zante, the interplate boundary comprises a stratified zone that may be considered as the sedimentary cover of the Ionian Basin oceanic-like crust, which forms the lower plate here. The shallower position and single-cycle reflection character of the interplate further north suggest that the lower plate could there be the Apulian paleomargin to that basin. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In most cases, a great part of the material collected by traps (200 and 540 m depth) was biogenic, opal being the most abundant constituent followed by organic matter. The composition of particles shows a seasonal pattern in the upper trap, which is much less evident at depth. Fluxes showed a marked seasonality due to the presence, in winter, of ice cover. During the sampling period, mass fluxes varied from 0.03 to 120 mg m-2 day-1 and from 24 to 393 mg m-2 day-1 at the upper and bottom level, respectively. Values of 0-64 mg m-2 day-1 of biogenic silica and 0-7.8 mg m-2 day-1 of organic carbon were obtained at 200 m depth. Near-bottom fluxes were almost always much higher: 11-141 and 1.5-19 mg m-2 day-1, respectively. 210Pb fluxes are lower than expected, and this means that particles sink rapidly without reaching an equilibrium with the radiotracer. A mechanism of focusing affects the bottom trap and much more, the seafloor. At site B, we measured particle fluxes that are much lower than those obtained at other locations in the Ross Sea. This can be due to low production and export during the sampling period, and underlies the necessity to further investigate the interannual variability of these processes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Among the total of 274 orfs within bacteriophage T4, only half have been reasonably well characterized, and the functions of the rest have remained obscure. In order to predict the molecular functions of the orfs, a position-specific iterated (PSI)-BLAST search of bacteriophage T4 against the sequence database of known 3D structures was carried out. PSI-BLAST is one of the most powerful iterative sequence search methods using multiple sequence alignment, with the ability to detect many more proteins with distant homology than standard pairwise methods. The 3D structures of proteins are considered to be better preserved than the sequences, and the detected distantly homologous proteins are likely to possess highly similar 3D structures. Thirteen orfs of phage T4, whose homologues were not detected by standard pairwise methods, were found to have significantly homologous counterparts by this method. The plausibility of the results was confirmed by checking whether important residues at substrate/ligand-binding sites were conserved. Among them, two orfs, vs.1 and e.1, which are similar to Escherichia coli lytic enzyme and MutT protein, respectively, had not been studied previously. Also, gp rIIA, a rapid lysis protein, whose gene structure had been intensively studied during the development of molecular biology in the 1950s and yet whose molecular function remains unknown, has an N-terminal domain that is significantly similar to the N-terminal region of the heat shock protein Hsp90. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The resulting transformation products were trapped and subsequently identified using GC-MS. Two smectites of different octahedral compositions were acid-activated under conditions known to produce catalysts of differing activity. Three different treatments were used for each smectite, thus providing six samples for evaluation. The thermal and catalytic decomposition of HDPE was studied under isothermal (60 min at 420\u00b0C) and dynamic (35-650\u00b0C at 10\u00b0C min-1) conditions. The thermal decomposition of HDPE yielded characteristic quartets of peaks in the chromatogram which were assigned to n-alkanes, l-alkenes, x-alkenes and \u03b1, \u03c9-dienes in the range C4-C22. Species of higher molecular weight than C22 were not detected. All six catalysts converted the alkenes present in the thermally generated off gases into light gases and aromatic species. Mono-, di- and trimethylbenzenes were the most abundant aromatic species although small quantities of ethylbenzenes and naphthalenes were produced. More aromatics were produced at 420\u00b0C than at temperatures up to 650\u00b0C, whereas the reverse was true for branched alkanes. The total conversion of HDPE increased with both the extent of acid treatment and the process temperature, whereas the proportion of aromatics produced was greatest for catalysts prepared using short acid-treatment times. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A GIS algorithm has been applied to analyse the maximum potential extent that lava flows can reach in order to delimit the areas topographically protected against flow invasion. The algorithm selected makes use of a special kind of spatial analysis functions called neighbourhood operators, in which the outcome depends on the values that one or more specified variables adopt in the surroundings of the element where analysis takes place. Assuming the maximum magnitude hypothesis, potential lava flow invasion areas can be calculated with spatial analysis functions in the context of two propagation regimes: persistent flow lengthening, and a combination of persistent flow lengthening and widening. To define the algorithm behaviour for each regime, a series of simple stochastic rules have been set to establish the way in which lava flow propagation can proceed. The algorithm has been applied on three source areas located in Tenerife Island characterised by their high probability of occurrence of basic effusive events. For each area, maximum potential flow extent has been calculated following both propagation regimes, with the aim of delimiting the areas that would potentially remain out of lava reach. No distance limits have been taken into account to carry out the calculation, as lava has on many occasions reached the coastline either in historic or geologic times. An additional hazard exposure level analysis has been possible in those areas where results indicated that flows could potentially arrive from more than one source. Algorithm performance assessment has been carried out in terms of accuracy by generating a series of 3D views and comparing the algorithm application results with those obtained from stochastic physical model simulation. Although the GIS algorithm applied does not distinguish the probability level of an area being invaded by lava, it has clearly identified on Tenerife the areas which are potentially safe from the flows that could originate at any point located inside or on the margins of each of the source areas considered. This capability can be advantageously used to develop medium-to long-term risk prevention and management measures. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Intracellular and field potential recordings were taken from the lateral nucleus of the amygdala in a rat horizontal brain slice preparation that included hippocampal formation. Pyramidal cells comprised the majority of labeled cells (77%). Electrophysiological classification based on hyperpolarizing or depolarizing afterpotentials subdivided both the pyramidal and non-pyramidal cell classes, although pyramidal cells tended to have hyperpolarizing afterpotentials (70%) and non-pyramidal cells tended to have depolarizing afterpotentials (63%). Synchronous population bursts were triggered with single extracellular stimuli in the deep layers of entorhinal cortex. These events propagated from deep layers of entorhinal cortex into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Latencies were consistent with a direct entorhinal to amygdala projection. Individual lateral nucleus neurons exhibited responses ranging from a long burst response that included an initial period of 200 Hz firing and a tail of gamma frequency firing lasting over 100 ms (grade 1) to an epsp with no firing (grade 4). Half of pyramidal cells responding to events initiated in entorhinal cortex were found to receive epsps strong enough to trigger firing. Only one stellate neuron fired in response to entorhinal stimulation. Excitatory postsynaptic responses included NMDA and non-NMDA receptor mediated components. We demonstrate that synchronous population events can propagate from entorhinal cortex to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and that pyramidal neurons of the lateral nucleus are more common targets than stellate neurons. We conclude that other synchronous events such as sharp waves and interictal spikes can spread from entorhinal cortex to amygdala in the same manner. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Objective: Sorbitol has been suggested as a suitable marker to assess liver blood flow (LBF), after it was shown to adequately reflect prolonged changes in LBF but changes of a shorter duration have not been investigated. We therefore used sorbitol to evaluate drug-induced decreases in LBF of variable duration with i.v. infusions of somatostatin and its synthetic analogue octreotide. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised study, six healthy males received sorbitol for 170 min. At sorbitol steady state, which was at 45 min after the start of the infusion (t=0), somatostatin or octreotide was infused for 30 min. Sampling for sorbitol assay and echo-Doppler hepatic portal vein flow measurements were done regularly and treatments were compared using ANOVA. Results: The sorbitol AUC over the 30-min intervention period was 15% (95% C.I.: +4, +22%) and 13% (+5, +24%) higher compared to placebo after somatostatin and octreotide respectively. The decline of sorbitol levels after termination of the intervention was faster for somatostatin compared to octreotide, demonstrated by the difference in the AUC (0-2 h) with placebo which was 8% (-3, +19%) lower after somatostatin, and 15% (+5, +26%) after octreotide. Portal venous blood flow decreased during the 30-min interventions; after somatostatin 27% (-14, -40%) and after octreotide 29% (-17, -42%). Portal flow was lower than placebo during the entire experiment after octreotide 30% (-10, -50%), but not after somatostatin 13% (-33, +7%). Changes in sorbitol levels and portal venous blood flow occurred simultaneously and were well correlated for each individual, making it likely that the interventions did not interfere with metabolism. Conclusion: Sorbitol can be used to adequately assess decreases in LBF of variable duration in healthy volunteers. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In each subject, rCBF and rCMRGlc were measured in sequence, during the same session. Both rCBF and rCMRGlc values were found to decrease from young (mean rCBF=43.7 ml/100 g per min; mean rCMRGlc=40.6 \u03bcmol/100 g per min) to old age (mean rCBF=37.3 ml/100 g per min; mean rCMRGlc=35.2 \u03bcmol/100 g per min), resulting in a drop over 40 years of 14.8% (0.37%/year) and 13.3% (0.34%/year), respectively. On a regional basis, the frontal and the visual cortices were observed to have, respectively, the highest and the lowest reduction in rCBF, while, for rCMRGlc, these extremes were observed in striatum and cerebellum. Despite these differences, the ratio of rCBF to rCMRGlc was found to have a similar behavior in all brain regions for young and old subjects as shown by a correlation coefficient of 88%. This comparative study indicates a decline in rCBF and rCMRGlc values and a coupling between CBF and CMRGlc as a function of age. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The study of these phenomena therefore needs an accurate representation of the atmosphere/ocean interface generally occupied by the ice pack. With this aim in view, a one-dimensional thermodynamic model based on Semtner's approach associated with a horizontal transport component is used to compute the sea ice thickness and extent. A visco-plastic ice rheology reproduces the ridging of the ice pack. Turbulent surface heat and momentum fluxes over ice and open areas are classically computed. The sea ice and leads are connected to the deep ocean through a mixed layer. The heat and salt fluxes between ice and water column are explicitly taken into account. The model is run with a set of climatological data to reproduce the ice formation during a year and the results are compared with available observations.

        "Absrtact": "A thorough understanding of fault seal processes is important in many practical and geological applications, which depend on subsurface flow of fluids. While the mechanisms involved in fault sealing are well known, the microscale processes involved and their relative contribution to sealing remain debatable. In particular, the extent to which diagenetic processes overprint cataclastic fault sealing has not been resolved, mainly due to the long time scales required to measure these effects. Here, we report results from a novel suite of room temperature experiments that combined continuous analysis of dissolved silica using on-line high performance liquid chromatography, with low strain rate creep loading on sandstone cores. This technique allowed changes in silica concentration during different phases of deformation to be resolved, and revealed a 7-fold increase in overall silica concentration immediately after dynamic faulting by localised cataclasis. Calculations based on these results show that the mass of dissolved silica from the resultant fault gouge increased by up to two orders of magnitude relative to that from the intact rock over the same time scale. This increase represents the first stage of the inherent diagenetic sealing capacity of the fault, presumably through localised diffusive mass transfer. Post-test microstructural studies suggest that the magnitude of diagenetic self-sealing depends on lithological and mechanical attributes of the host rock, which control fault gouge microstructure. Our experiments suggest that diagenetic processes may account for permeability reduction of up to two orders of magnitude, comparable to reductions due to cataclasis alone. Together, these two processes account for the 5-6 orders of magnitude reduction of permeability observed in natural faults and deformation bands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

A 1.33 ha experimental area at Monaughty forest, northeast Scotland was treated with 200 m3 ha-1 of anaerobically digested sewage sludge. Approximately 400 kg ha-1 of nitrogen (N) and 200 kg ha-1 of phosphorus (P) were applied in the sludge treatment. The hydrological balance and fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus in throughfall and soil drainage water (O1, O2 and Bs soil horizons) over the short (3 month) and longer-term (17 month) period after application are compared with untreated areas. Immediate increases in soluble ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4) were apparent within the organic soil horizons and PO4 in the Bs horizons of sludge-treated areas. This observation was attributed to the direct leaching of nutrients contained within the original liquid phase which constituted 95% (by volume) of the sludge. The late autumn application of sludge which contained only small amounts of nitrate (NO3) (<0.05 kg N ha-1) initially resulted in limited additional mineralisation and consequently little N leached as NO3. Over the longer 17 month period the total fluxes of both N and P from sludge-treated areas remained greater than those of the untreated areas with significant losses as NO3 being detected from the organic and Bs horizons. However, total fluxes of N and P measured in the soil drainage water from the lowest soil horizon, over the whole study period represented 2.5 and <1%, respectively, of the total N and P applied as sludge. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper focuses on those indicators related to land quality and highlights the use of GIS to reconfigure land use and climatic data to a soil landscape spatial model in order to apply models of soil degradation. The 1981 and 1991 Census of agriculture data from a cadastral base and climatic indices from iso-contour maps are related to the soil landscapes of Canada to identify trends in the amount of soil cover, the risk of soil erosion by wind and the risk of soil salinization. Results indicate that soil cover has improved by about 11% through the use of conservation tillage and crop residue management and reduced summerfallowing, and that the risk of wind erosion in the prairies has decreased by 7% in the 10 years. The risk of soil salinization has remained constant on 93% of cropland, decreased on 7% and increased on <1%. It appears that the improvements in soil quality protection have occurred despite some shifts to more intensive cropping systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "We describe the relationships between the number, size and type of cavities in six species of eucalypt trees from southern New South Wales (south-eastern Australia) and tree diameter, tree height, tree species and other measures. The eucalypt species studied were:-Narrow-leaved Peppermint (Eucalyptus radiata), Mountain Swamp Gum (Eucalyptus camphora), Mountain Gum (Eucalyptus dalrympleana), Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha), Ribbon Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and, Broad-leaved Peppermint (Eucalyptus dives). E. radiata and E. macrorhyncha supported almost twice the proportion of branch-end hollows than cavities assigned to other categories. Cavities in the main trunk were the predominant hollow class in E. viminalis and E. dalrympleana. Large diameter trees were characterised by more branch-end hollows, whereas main trunk cavities were typically the most prevalent cavity type in smaller diameter stems. We identified a simple, general rule that highlights the relationships between cavities and readily measured tree attributes. Our data show that, in general, both the number of cavities and cavity size were directly proportional to tree diameter, but inversely proportional to the square root of tree height. This proportionality changed between different tree species. E. dives and E. viminalis supported, on average, larger cavities than other species, whereas the cavities in E. macrorhyncha were smaller than the other taxa sampled. This simple general relationship may make it possible to make rapid crude estimates of cavity abundance across large areas of forest by measuring simple tree attributes such as tree diameter and tree height.

The three-dimensional framework structure is built up by GeO4 tetrahedra, connected in such way that they form intersecting 12-ring channels along all three crystallographic axes. This is the first germanate zeotype with large intersecting channels.

The crustal Poisson ratio can be determined from the joint analysis of the travel times of waves converted at the Moho and of crustal multiples reflected at the top of the Moho. We have analyzed the records of the permanent stations installed on the Australian continent, complemented by the data of the SKIPPY experiment. The results reveal substantial variations in the Poisson ratio in the different tectonic units. For the Proterozoic crust, an increase of the Poisson ratio with increasing crustal thickness is systematically observed while for the Phanerozoic crust, the Poisson ratio tends to decrease for increasing crustal thickness. These observations are in remarkable agreement with the results of the deep seismic soundings that were performed in the former Soviet Union. The variations observed in the Proterozoic provinces can perhaps be explained by underplating of mafic materials at the base of the crust. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Applications in engineering manufacture, such as dimensional inspection, often require triangulation of large sets of measured 3D data. The CAD models of relevant complex parts are usually defined using trimmed NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline). With such situations in mind, the paper proposes a new triangulation procedure which achieves high efficiency and robustness by utilising the CAD model as an available 2D manifold which approximates the shape of the actual part. The steps in this procedure are alignment between the data and the model, registration of the measured points to the model entities, triangulation in the R2 domain provided by the parametric surface entities, 3D mesh improvement, stitching of mesh patches and smoothing of the final mesh. The method does not assume any prior knowledge about the point ordering and performs well in the presence of the measurement noise, while also bypassing the problems of occlusion and overlap that are commonly associated with range imaging. The performance of the proposed method was analysed in relation to some other methods using models of real engineering parts. The results are highly encouraging, leading to a conclusion that the methods is well suited to practical engineering applications.",

        "Absrtact": "A central dilemma in understanding terranes that have translated long distances is that modern plate tectonics and paleomagnetic studies indicate translations of thousands of kilometers, while the faults along which the terranes moved these great distances are not found. Relations long known from geology and from recent studies of modern transform-plate boundaries suggest that preserving strike-slip faults that record 1000-km-scale translations is unlikely, and therefore, in many cases. Paleomagnetism may be our only reliable indicator of how far terranes translated. Four reasons are explored here for why large-offset strike-slip faults are likely to be missing in translated terranes. (1) Strike-slip faults in continents commonly are partially or wholly destroyed, or reactivated. Only ) e1400-500 km of over 1000 km of offset on Cretaceous-early Tertiary strike-slip faults in northern British Columbia are accounted for in southern British Columbia. The missing strike-slip faults probably continued south into the hinterland of the Rocky Mountain thrust belt as oblique-thrust faults, much like the modern Alpine-Marlborough fault system of New Zealand. The major strike-slip faults in southeastern British Columbia were obliterated by Eocene extensional faulting, uplift and erosion. (2) Offsets of 1000 km scale are likely to occur on many anastomosing faults with offsets of 100 km scale. Many of which are 'left behind' and not found in the translated terrane. The greater San Andreas plate boundary has accumulated \u223c1200 km of transform motion that is distributed on numerous faults from the offshore borderland to eastern California. There is a narrow 'terrane' in the offshore borderland of California that has moved \u223c1200 km relative to North America, but no single fault has nearly that much offset. (3) Major faults in narrow oceans formed by oblique-divergent plate boundaries have a low potential for preservation. For example, the deep, dense oceanic crust of the Gulf of California, where the major transform faults of the oblique rift lie, has a low potential for preservation. In contrast. Baja California is currently a continental terrane that has translated \u223c300 km relative to North America along the plate boundary in the Gulf of California. Because of the relative buoyancy of continental crust, Baja California is likely to be preserved in any future accretion event. (4) Faults in the margins of oblique-divergent plate boundaries are dominantly normal faults and not strike-slip faults. There is little strike-slip faulting in central Baja California. Even though the plate boundary has a rift angle \u03b1 of only 20\u00b0. Recent field data and modeling show that at \u03b1=0-20\u00b0 strikeslip faults will dominate the secondary faults. Surprisingly, at \u03b1 =\u223c20 to \u223c35\u00b0, there are both strike-slip and normal faults, and at \u03b1> \u223c35-45\u00b0, there are few or no strike-slip faults, even though the relative motion of these types of oblique rifts is dominated by transcurrent motion over extensional motion. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "There were climatic regime shifts over the North Pacific in 1976 and 1988 which affected the dynamics of the marine ecosystem and fisheries resources in Korean waters. Precipitation in Korean waters showed a decadal scale climatic jump, especially of Ullungdo Island, reflecting the regime shift that occurred in the North Pacific. The variation was also detected in East Asian atmospheric systems. The Aleutian Low and North Pacific High Pressure Systems showed substantial changes in 1976 and around 1987-89. 1976 was an unusually warm year for Korea; mean sea surface temperature (SST) was higher than 'normal' and was accompanied by a northward shift in the thermal front. Post 1976, the volume transport of the Kuroshio Current increased and higher seawater and air temperatures persisted until 1988. Other shifts occurred after 1976 such as an increase in mixed layer depth (MLD) and biological changes in the ecosystem of Korean waters including decreases in spring primary production and an increase in autumn primary production. Primary production increased again after 1988, and was followed by a significant increase in zooplankton biomass after 1991. The 1976 regime shift was manifested by a decreased biomass and production of saury, but an increase in biomass and production of sardine and filefish in Korean waters. After 1988, recruitment, biomass, and production of sardine collapsed while those of mackerel substantially increased. Based on these observations, hypotheses on the relationship between the climate-driven oceanic changes and changes in fisheries resources were developed and are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

After complete gas-chromatographic separation of the enantiomers in the first column, gas phase enantiomerization of the heart-cut fraction of one single enantiomer is performed in the second (reactor) column at increased temperature and afterwards this fraction is separated into the enantiomers in the third column. From the observed de novo enantiomeric peak areas a(j), the enantiomerization time t and the enantiomerization temperature T, the enantiomerization (inversion) barrier \u0394G(number sign)(gas)(T) is determined and from temperature-dependent experiments, the activation enthalpy \u0394H(number sign)(gas) and the activation entropy \u0394S(number sign)(gas) are obtained. Enantiomerization studies on chiral 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylaziridine by stopped-flow MDGC yielded activation parameters of nitrogen inversion in the gas phase, i.e., \u0394G(number sign)(gas)(353 K) = 110.5 \u00b1 0.5 kJ mol-1, \u0394H(number sign)(gas) = 71.0 \u00b1 3.8 kJ mol-1 and \u0394S(number sign)(gas) = -109 \u00b1 11 J mol-1 K-1.

The values obtained by stopped-flow MDGC in the gas phase were used to calculate the activation parameters of nitrogen inversion of 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylaziridine in the liquid phase in the presence of the chiral selector Chirasil-nickel(II), i.e., \u0394G(number sign)(liq)(353 K) = 106.0 \u00b1 0.4 kJ mol-1, \u0394H(number sign)(liq) = 68.3 \u00b1 1.4 kJ mol-1 and \u0394S(number sign)(liq) = -106 \u00b1 3.0 J mol-1 K-1.

        "Absrtact": "A set of seismic reflection lines, collected in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea offshore the Campanian-Latial continental margin has been selected and interpreted. The aim is to characterize: (1) the structural features of the 41st Parallel Line (41PL), an E-W elongated magnetic anomaly zone separating the Northern Tyrrhenian domain from the Southern Tyrrhenian domain; and (2) to study the relationships between the 41PL and the Ortona-Roccamonfina Line (ORL), a tectonic structure transversal to the Apennines along which the Northern Apennine Arc merges the Southern Arc. The interpretation of the seismic lines is discussed in light of the available geological (stratigraphic and structural) and geophysical (gravimetric and magnetic) information. Results show that the Campanian-Latial continental margin is characterized by a series of structural lows and highs that match with the main structures on the mainland (Mt. Massico horst, the Volturno and Garigliano depressions). The study area is characterized by ESEWNW to E-W and NE-SW striking faults. The activity of these faults developed during Pliocene-Early Pleistocene times. ESE-WNW to E-W faults display structures consistent with strike-slip movements. These faults, which are located on the maximum gradient of the E-W elongated magnetic alignment of 41PL, are responsible for the SSE translation of the offshore sector of the Mt. Massico horst. The horizontal dislocation of Mt. Massico suggests left-lateral movements for the ESE-WNW to E-W faults. The NE-SW faults that affect the Mt. Massico horst, which represents the southern tip of ORL, show seismic features consistent with normal movements, as also revealed by inland data. Since: (1) background seismicity is virtually absent along the study area; and (2) the uppermost seismic reflectors seem unaffected by faults, it is very likely that both the ORL and 41PL fault zones are now inactive, at least in the Campanian-Latial area. Seismic data indicate that ORL is older than 41PL and support the interpretation that the 41PL represents a deep-seated transfer fault system formed in response to the different rates of opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The strike-slip movements along the 41PL faults and the normal movements along the ORL faults are consistent with a NW-SE extension, which is responsible for the longitudinal extension in the Southern Apennines belt.

The BBL is the layer of water, often tens of meters thick, adjacent to the sea bed and with homogenous properties of temperature and salinity, which sometimes contains resuspended detrital particles. The SWI is the bioreactive interface between the water column and the upper 1 cm of sediment and can include a large layer of detrital material composed of aggregates that have sedimented from the upper mixed layer of the ocean. This material is biologically transformed, over a wide range of time scales, eventually forming the sedimentary record. To understand the microbial ecology of deep-sea bacteria, we need to appreciate the food supply in the upper ocean, its packaging, passage and transformation during the delivery to the sea bed, the seasonality of variability of the supply and the environmental conditions under which the deep-sea bacteria grow. We also need to put into a microbial context recent geochemical findings of vast reservoirs of intrinsically labile organic material sorped onto sediments. These may well become desorped, and once again available to microorganisms, during resuspension events caused by deep ocean currents. As biotechnologists apply their tools in the deep oceans in search of unique bacteria, an increasing knowledge and understanding of the natural processes undertaken and environmental conditions experienced by deep-sea bacteria will facilitate this exploitation.

This design allowed the investigation of patterns of brain activity during a range of self-reported cue evoked emotional states, both in the presence and absence of heroin. Self-reports of 'urge to use' correlated strongly with increased regional blood flow (rCBF) in the inferior frontal and orbitofrontal cortex target regions of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, implicated in conditioning and reward. 'Urge to use' was also associated with highly significant increased rCBF in the right pre- cuneus, an area associated with episodic memory retrieval, and in the left insula, implicated in the processing of the emotional components of stimuli.

Consequently, it has been used clinically with radiotherapy, and has stimulated considerable interest for analogue development. More recent studies also suggested a possible role for the drug in enhancing tumour blood flow; we therefore undertook a comprehensive examination of mitomycin C as a potential radiosensitizer in murine and human tumours growing in mice. Materials and methods: Two dissimilar human tumour xenograft systems, SiHa and WiDr cells, were used as was the murine SCCVII line. Effects of mitomycin C treatment on the regional and microregional blood flow in these tumours was evaluated, and cell sorting based on dye perfusion techniques was used to study the cytotoxicity of mitomycin C as a single agent or in combination with radiation in the xenograft systems. Results: Contrary to our expectations, no preferential killing of less-well oxygenated tumour cells in situ was observed, nor were any consistent effects on tumour blood flow found. The inclusion of mitomycin C with radiation did, however, produce a modest increase in cell killing in the hypoxic subpopulations of the xenograft system with the largest hypoxic fraction. Conclusions: Our results indicate that combined treatment with mitomycin C and radiation cannot be rationalized on the expectation of either complementary cytotoxicity of the modalities, or of drug-induced improvement in tumour oxygenation.

We sought to establish the outlook for fetuses diagnosed with atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) prenatally and its relation to additional cardiac, extracardiac and chromosomal abnormalities. Background. Prediction of likely outcome of AVSD presenting prenatally is complicated by the wide variation in associated features. Methods. Computerized records from 14,726 pregnancies referred to a fetal cardiology center were reviewed retrospectively. Pathological reports, postnatal records, follow-up inquiries and review of echocardiographic video recordings supplemented analysis of the records for all those with AVSD. Results. Atrioventricular septal defect was confirmed in 301 fetuses. Eighty-six (39%) of the 218 with known karyotype had trisomy 21, and 21/218 (10%) had other chromosome abnormalities. Right isomerism occurred in 37/301 (12%) fetuses, left isomerism in 62 (20%), mirror image atrial arrangement in 2 (1%), and 200 (67%) had usual arrangement. Atrioventricular septal defect occurred without any other intracardiac abnormality in 155 fetuses (51%). Extracardiac abnormalities and nonkaryotypic syndromes were evident in 40 fetuses (13%, confidence interval [CI] 9.5-17.1%). Uncomplicated cardiac anatomy was significantly associated with the presence of karyotype abnormality (p < 0.0001). Parents opted for termination of pregnancy in 175/298 (58.5%). For the continuing pregnancies, Kaplan-Meier estimates for live birth, survival past the neonatal period and survival to three years were 82% (CI 75.3-88.9%), 55% (CI 46.0%-64.3%) and 38% (CI 27.1-48.6%), respectively. Fetal hydrops and earlier year of diagnosis were independent variables with adverse influence on survival. Conclusions. Despite some improvements in the outlook for AVSD diagnosed prenatally, the overall prognosis remains considerably poorer than that implied from surgical series. The detection of associated cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities is important in order to give the best indication of the likely outcome when counseling parents.

        "Absrtact": "The potential effects of future climate change were investigated, corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm, on agricultural production of four different cropping systems at two Italian locations, Modena and Foggia. Climate change scenarios, derived from two general circulation models (GCMs), were used as weather input to a soil-plant growth simulator, CropSyst. This model was recently modified to include the effects of elevated CO2 on crop photosynthesis and transpiration. Six different crops in total were simulated at the two Italian sites. At Modena, a 3-year maize-maize-wheat rotation and a 2-year soybean-barley-summer sorghum rotation were studied. At Foggia, a 2-year sunflower-wheat-fallow rotation, and a 2-year wheat-fallow-spring sorghum rotation were simulated. Results suggested that the combined effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change at both sites would depress crop yields if current management practices were not modified. Specifically, predicted warmer air temperatures accelerated plant phenology, reducing dry matter accumulation and crop yields by 10-40%. By investigating adaptation strategies, it was found that a combination of early planting for spring-summer crops and the use of slower-maturing winter cereal cultivars succeeds in maintaining crop yields at current levels at both sites. For irrigated maize and soybean production at Modena, 60-90% more irrigation water was required under climate change to keep grain yields at current levels. This implies that adaptation to climate change may be limited for irrigated crops, depending on site-specific water availability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

These two profiles bracket a region of rapid change in physical properties and structural styles. The travel-time modeling indicates little structural change along the profiles, and therefore the data are suitable for amplitude modeling with the reflectivity method. For the profile 10 km from the trench, amplitude modeling indicates a margin wedge with velocities of 4-4.4 km/s and Q(p) = 25-50. For the profile 20 km from the trench, the amplitude modeling indicates a margin wedge with velocities of 4.4-4.8 km/s and Q(p) = 50-75. The primary new result of this analysis is the constraint that Q(p) = 25-75 within the margin wedge at both locations. These high attenuation values are consistent with fracturing of the material making up the margin wedge, either ophiolitic Nicoya Complex rocks, dewatered and cemented sediments, or a tectonic mixture of both.

RT-PCR primers from conserved parts of the VP1 capsid gene were designed on the basis of good correlation with sequences of EV71 strains. These primers successfully amplified 44 strains of EV71 including 34 strains isolated from Singapore in 1997 and 1998, eight strains from Malaysia isolated in 1997 and 1998, one Japanese strain and the neurovirulent strain EV71/7423/MS/87. RT-PCR of 30 strains of other enteroviruses including coxsackievirus A and B, and echoviruses failed to give any positive amplicons. Hence, RT-PCR with these primers showed 100% correlation with serotyping. Direct sequencing of the RT- PCR products of 20 EV71 strains revealed a distinct cluster with two major subgroups, thus enabling genetic typing of the viruses. The genetic heterogeneity of these strains culminated in amino acid substitutions within the VP1, VP2 and VP3 regions. The sequencing of a 2.9 kb fragment comprising the capsid region and the major part of 5' UTR of two Singapore strains revealed that they belonged to a group distinct from the prototype EV71/BrCr strain and the EV71/7423/MS/87 strain. The dendrogram generated from 341 bp fragments within the VP1 region revealed that the strains of Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan belong to two entirely different EV71 genogroups, distinct from the three genogroups identified in another recent study. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The interactions of plasma IgM and IgG with tissue extracts as sources of self-antigens were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting. Data were compared by means of multiparametric statistical analysis. The data summarized here demonstrate that natural self-reactive antibody repertoires of healthy individuals are restricted to a limited subset of immunodominant autoantigens that is selected early in development, and remains conserved between individuals through ageing. The selection of human natural self- reactive IgG antibody repertoires requires normal T-/B-cell interactions. The immunoblotting assay has the potential to distinguish between autoimmune diseases with organ-related oligoclonal expansion of self-reactive clones and those characterized by broad alterations of immunoregulation. However, organ- specific autoimmune diseases may be characterized by altered patterns of antibody repertoires unrelated to the target organ. The assay also revealed an unexpected defect in the regulatory function of self-reactive IgM on the expression of self-reactive IgG repertoires in several systemic and organ- specific autoimmune diseases. The results are discussed in the light of our current understanding of the processes of selection of self-reactive B-cells and the pathophysiology of autoimmunity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Meteorological variability was generated using series of measured air temperature, rainfall and global radiation for a period of at least 15 years, and these were then expanded to 100 years using the climate simulator CLIMGEN. Soil variability was simulated using the scale factor approach. The scale factor mean and standard deviation were obtained in eight locations within a 1000-m2 area. The stochastic scale factors were applied to parameters a and b in Campbell's water retention function and to hydraulic conductivity. The following combinations of crops were simulated in the two soils: (a) continuous maize for silage (MM); (b) continuous maize for grain (MG); (c) a combination of late harvested Italian ryegrass and short cycle silage maize (LRM); and (d) early harvested Italian ryegrass and late maturing silage maize (ERM). The crops were fertilized with 200 or 300 kg N ha-1 year-1 (or 450 kg for MM) and submitted to three water regimes: no irrigation, irrigation on the basis of water balance and conventional irrigation, which resulted in the highest volume. The simulated leaching was higher when fertilization and irrigation inputs were higher. It was further reduced by the introduction of cover-crop and was higher in the sandy soil. All these factors interacted, creating different levels of nitrate loss risk, that ranged from a minimum leaching of 4 kg N ha-1 year-1, with a 10% breakthrough probability of 16 kg N ha-1 year-1 (low fertilized and irrigated ERM in the sandy-loam soil) to a maximum average leaching of 146 kg N ha-1 year-1 with a 10% breakthrough probability of 235 kg N ha-1 year-1 (high fertilized, conventionally irrigated MM in the sandy soil). The breakthrough probability curves associated to nitrate leaching are skewed, showing that lower than average values are more frequent than higher ones. The standard deviations of yearly leaching were closely correlated to the means and were frequently greater than the means, particularly in the sandy soil. The stochastic simulation results offered the possibility of ranking cropping systems into classes of probability of exceeding a given value of leaching and the possibility of deriving suggestions for improved crop management.

        "Absrtact": "The coccolith-based micropaleontological investigation of an exceptionally thick deep-sea Holocene sediment core was conducted in order to document the pattern and timing of surface circulation changes south of Iceland, over the Gardar contour drift, during the last 12 000 years. Fluctuations in bulk carbonate content at the core location are primarily driven by the coccolith fraction. The observed overall correlation between bottom flow speed, as given by the 'sortable silt' mean size index, and the bulk coccolith concentration (abundance/g dry sediment) suggests that the accumulation of this fine carbonate fraction is, as a first order, controlled by processes of sediment redistribution by bottom current. The down-core variations in coccolith assemblage structure (species %) indicate that changes in properties of surface waters south of Iceland occurred as two distinct steps at ca. 11.2 and 6 ka. The onset of North Atlantic Drift water influence over the Gardar Drift after 11.2 ka was associated with excess export flux of coccolith carbonate in the vicinity of an active frontal system. The period from 10 to 6 ka saw the progressive warming of the study area, which culminated between 6 and 7 ka. Cooling of the surface waters after 6 ka, as indicated changes in the relative abundances of the dominant coccolith species, took place in two phases, the present hydrological regime being only established after a last cooling step between 3.5 and 2.8 ka. These long-term reorganisations of the surface hydrology are interpreted as the response of the North Atlantic to the combined force of the solar insolation and the waning Laurentide ice sheet. Millennial-scale perturbations of the surface hydrology are documented by changes in accumulation of the species Emiliania huxleyi. These successive decreases in the export fluxes of E. huxleyi exhibit a distinct millennial pacing, in phase with previously recorded Holocene advection of cool, ice-bearing waters from the Greenland-Iceland seas to the British islands. From a clear analogy with the most recent extreme variation in global ocean climate, we argue that mechanisms responsible for these observed millennial-scale perturbations might be found in long-term modulations of the atmospheric processes associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

Animal model, sire model and sire maternal grandsire model were tested for their suitability to evaluate young sires in progeny test. There were 38 188 records on animals slaughtered in two slaughter houses during a period of 20 months. Effects of year-month of slaughter, age at slaughter, sex and breed were statistically significant, and herd accounted for about 20-57% of the total variation in the data. Estimates of heritability in the different breed by sex data sets were in range of 0.07-0.14 for slaughter weight, 0.16-0.31 for fleshiness and 0.08-0.16 for fatness, whereas the corresponding within herd heritabilities varied from 0.15 to 0.29, 0.29 to 0.39 and 0.12 to 0.29, respectively. There was a positive genetic correlation of 0.38-0.66 between slaughter weight and fleshiness, whereas fatness was not genetically correlated with the other studied traits. All within herd correlations were high, from 0.55 to 0.93, and phenotypic and environmental correlations were also high or moderate. In the estimation of (co)variance components, sire model and sire maternal grandsire model were preferred to animal model due to computational requirements, and sire maternal grandsire model to sire model due to the possibility of including the sire path of maternal pedigree.

The hydrophobic polyaromatic hydrocarbon benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and the more polar 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene (PRODAN) were used to assess the effect of high quencher concentration on the quenching process in micelles. Using the surfactant systems sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100 (TX-100), three distinct modalities of quenching were observed. For the TX-100 system, both I- and H2O2 quenching of probe fluorescence reached saturation in efficiency. These data are modeled quite well by assuming a limited number of quenching sites per micelle in conjunction with standard Stern-Volmer quenching dynamics. For the SDS system, similar quenching saturation effects are observed, but the saturation model worked less well. It is suggested that a bimodal distribution of micelle sizes could be responsible. The B(a)P/SDS/I- system is singular in that the quenching does not saturate. The efficiency of quenching here varies approximately with the third power of I- concentration. A resonance energy transfer mechanism is proposed in which B(a)P is quenched by I3 -. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.",

        "Absrtact": "Various lines of evidence suggest a close relationship between heat shock proteins (hsp) and several autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. While enhanced expression of hsp in autoimmune diseases is often regarded as a non-specific bystander effect of the inflammatory process, surprisingly little is known on hsp regulation by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines. In this study cytokine-induced expression of hsp60, hsp27 and \u03b1B-crystallin was studied in cultures of primary human adult astrocytes at the mRNA as well as at the protein level. We show differential hsp expression patterns in response to pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. Hsp60 expression was found to be enhanced in response to cytokines as diverse as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10. Upregulation of hsp27, however, was primarily induced by immunoregulatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 whereas \u03b1B-crystallin expression was found to be enhanced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 only. None of the cytokines studied was able to enhance expression of all three hsp simultaneously. These results show that in human astrocytes induced expression of hsp27 and \u03b1B-crystallin is dependent on the presence of a defined set of stimuli, while induced expression of hsp60 is a much less selective event. This highly differential pattern of hsp expression in response to inflammatory mediators known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases indicates that hsp responses are specific rather than non-specific bystander responses.

High-resolution seismic, lithologic, paleontologic, and radiocarbon data from the east Texas continental shelf were used to map a stage 3 shoreline. The shoreline was placed in a regional context with a study of the Texas shelf, based on seismic profiles, core, and platform boring descriptions, that identifies the stage 3 maximum flooding surface and the stage 2 sequence boundary. These surfaces were then traced up-dip on the east Texas shelf where a shore parallel escarpment was recognized. Landward of the escarpment the stage 3 maximum flooding surface is amalgamated with the stage 2 sequence boundary. Therefore, the location of the escarpment marks the up-dip limit of stage 3 deposits and a stage 3 shoreline. Lagoonal sediments with in situ brackish water fossils on-lap the escarpment. Seaward of the escarpment, remnants of barrier island facies have been preserved as a bank, Freeport Rocks Bathymetric High, located in -18 m of water. The shoreline (adjusted for subsidence) is located at -15 \u00b1 2 m, which is shallower than what oxygen isotope and coral records indicate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In polar environments, characterization of antioxidant defences in key sentinel species may be of particular value as early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are progressively increasing in these remote areas. The complexities associated with predicting the consequences at the 'organism level' of variations of specific antioxidant defences have been recently overcome by the ability to quantify an index of specific biological resistance to various kinds of ROS. The total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay has been used in three species of scallops for quantifying their ability to neutralize peroxyl (ROO\u00b7) and hydroxyl (\u00b7OH) radicals and peroxynitrite (HOONO). Adamussium colbecki and Chlamys islandicus represent key organisms for monitoring Antarctic and Arctic regions while Pecten jacobaeus was chosen for a comparison with a related temperate species. TOSC values for ROO\u00b7 were significantly higher in A. colbecki indicating this species as the most efficient scavenger of ROO\u00b7. Mediterranean scallops had the lowest TOSC for ROO\u00b7. A. colbecki also exhibited the highest scavenging capacity for \u00b7OH with values more than 2- fold greater than for C. islandicus and P. jacobaeus. TOSC for HOONO was lower for all scallops as compared to those for ROO\u00b7 or \u00b7OH. TOSC for microsomes was not significantly different among the species for any ROS studied, and the percentage contribution to the specific TOSC for the various oxidants of microsomes of all scallops accounted for 1-3% of the total TOSC of the post-mitochondrial fraction. The specific TOSC of scallop microsomes for \u00b7OH was approximately ten times lower than that for ROO\u00b7 or HOONO. The higher basal capability of the Antarctic scallop to neutralize different reactive oxygen species is discussed in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment and TOSC is validated as a quantifiable measure of susceptibility to oxidative stress in marine organisms.

Furthermore, it evaluates the influences of the information provided from IMT-SPECT for three-dimensional (3D) conformal treatment planning. Methods and Materials: In 30 patients with nonresected, histologically proven brain gliomas (glioblastoma - 13 patients, astrocytoma Grade III - 12 patients, astrocytoma Grade II - 3 patients, oligodendroglioma Grade III - 1 patient, oligodendroglioma Grade II - 1 patient), IMT-SPECT and MRI were performed pretherapeutically in the same week. A special software system allowed the coregistration of the IMT-SPECT and MRI data. The gross tumor volume (GTV) defined on the IMT-SPECT/T2-MRI fusion images (GTV-IMT/T2) was compared with the GTV-T2, defined on the T2-MRI alone. On the IMT-SPECT/T1Gd-MRI overlays, the volume of the IMT tumor uptake (GTV-IMT) was compared with the volume of the gadolinium (Gd) enhancement (GTV-T1Gd). The initial planning target volume (PTV) and the boost volume (BV) outlined on the IMT-SPECT/T2-MRI co- images were analyzed comparatively to the PTV and BV delineated using the T2- MRI alone. Results: In all 30 patients a higher IMT uptake of tumor areas, compared to the normal brain tissue was observed. Mean GTV-IMT, mean GTV-T2, and mean GTV-T1Gd were 43, 82, and 16 cm3, respectively. IMT tumor uptake outside the contrast enhancement regions was observed in all patients. Mean relative increase of tumor volume defined on the fusion images, GTV-IMT/T1Gd versus GTV-T1Gd alone was 78%. IMT tumor uptake areas outside the GTV-T2 were registered in 7 patients (23%). In these patients, the mean increase GTV- IMT/T2 was 33% higher than GTV-T2, defined according to the T2-MRI data alone. The additional information provided by IMT-SPECT modified minimally the initial PTV (mean relative increase PTV-IMT/T2 versus PTV-T2, 5%) but significantly the BV (mean relative increase BV-IMT/T2 versus BV-T2, 37%). Conclusion: In a significant number of patients, the IMT-SPECT investigation improves tumor detection and delineation in the planning process. This has important consequences in the 3D conformal treatment planning, especially in the delineation of BV and in dose escalation studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "Sedimentological data, in particular sediment grain size, from core MD95-2040 (2465 m water depth) and a nearby core (OMII-9K; 1833 m water depth), presently under the influence of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water and Deep Intermediate Water, respectively, have been used to reconstruct changes in the vigour of near-bottom water flow on the Iberian margin. The pattern of the palaeocurrent index indicates faster flow during the warm periods and slower in cold. This also holds in the Younger Dryas but there is an added effect of brief collapse of the circulation in Termination 1B due to meltwater input. The cold periods are generally characterised by elevated clay percentage (terrigenous material < 2 \u03bcm diameter) and overall sediment accumulation fluxes. In comparison, warm periods of higher flow have lower depositional flux and a tendency to silt (terrigenous material 2-63 \u03bcm) dominance consistent with the higher flow speed and suppression of clay deposition. This is in contrast with a recent 230Th(xs)\u00b0-based study of two cores (MD95-2040 and -2039) [J. Thomson et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 165 (1999) 255-270], which concluded that increased glacial sediment and Th focussing was caused by stronger currents. The crucial factor is that the controlling speed is that of the flow at the depositional site rather than that of the erosional or transporting flow to the site. High glacial maximum fluxes of carbonate (~6 g cm-2 ka-1) are largely composed of fine (<63 \u03bcm) non-coccolith material, suggesting a significant detrital component. It is proposed that the sediment and Th arrive on the lower slope via different routes, sediment down-slope in bottom nepheloid layers and turbidity currents, Th scavenged from the water column by organic matter, and are rapidly mixed on the bed. Removal of this material from a large area and its deposition in a small one adjacent to Oporto Seamount, together with a small amount of direct down-slope supply, accounts for the properties of the deposits. Allowance for erroneous fluxes due to possible coring expansion 'stretching' of the upper part of MD95-2040 does not invalidate these conclusions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using wavelength independent emissivity very good agreement was found with previous melting study, theoretical calculations and shockwave experiments. Analysis of the data using Lindemann and Simon melting equations suggests that melting occurs close to, but not exactly at the same pressure as measured at the cold state. Grueneisen parameter \u03b3 scales with volume as \u03b3/\u03b30 = V/V0, where \u03b30 = 2.2\u00b10.1, a value close to 2.14 from adiabatic decompression experiments. The melting curve, when transformed to normalized coordinates, verifies the prediction of work of Schlosser et al. for the linear relationship between normalized melting temperature and normalized pressure. Fit of the combined data from melting, thermal expansion, room compression, and shockwave studies to the Mie-Grueneisen thermal equation of state gives \u03b30 = 2.42\u00b10.02; Anderson's thermal pressure model yields -0.032\u00b10.001 and -0.001\u00b10.001 GPa/K for the temperature derivative of isothermal bulk modulus at constant pressure and constant volume, respectively.",

In contrast, their use in correlations with pharmacokinetic properties is still poorly explored and exploited. 3D molecular fields can be obtained from ab initio, semiempirical or molecular mechanics levels of calculation. The newly developed procedure called VolSurf is able to compress the relevant information present in 3D maps into a few descriptors characterized by the simplicity of their use and interpretation. These descriptors can be quantitatively compared and used to build multivariate models correlating 3D molecular structures with biological responses. The VolSurf procedure is applied here to generate descriptors and models of structure-permeation relationships. The VolSurf procedure, which was originally designed to handle a medium amount of data, can easily be applied to problems of large size such as bioisostere databases, CombyChem databases and related approaches.

These factors include the HLA and CTLA-4 genes. The mechanisms by which these genes confer increased susceptibility to HT are unclear. The identification of these genes has failed to explain completely the large hereditary effect observed in families of patients. More substantial genetic determinants must be hidden in the folds of the human genome and will most likely be detected in the near future. The powerful approach of linkage analysis will be supported by advancements in the description of the human genome and by technologic improvements in the ability to process large amounts of biologic data. Knowledge of such determinants will provide predictive tools to be used on clinical grounds and invaluable insight into the pathogenesis of this puzzling disease.",

        "Absrtact": "A high-resolution cyclostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic study was carried out on cyclically bedded successions of middle Miocene lacustrine to distal alluvial fan-floodplain deposits from the Calatayud basin, in northeast Spain. Eight (partially overlapping) subsections near the village of Orera are correlated in detail using distinct sedimentary cycle patterns or by following marker beds in the field. Together they form the Orera Composite Section (OCS). Sedimentary cycles are recognised on at least two different scales. The basic small-scale cycles in the OCS consist of an alternation of grey and, occasionally, red clays with white, dolomite-rich, carbonate beds. They are arranged in larger-scaled, so-called large-scale cycles based on repetitive changes in the overall carbonate-clay lithology. Two other, but less distinct, types of intermediate scale cyclicity are also recognised. In terms of depositional environment, the cycle hierarchy is interpreted to represent periodic lake expansion over the palaeo-alluvial fan-floodplain area. The palaeomagnetic results yield a reliable magnetostratigraphic record, which confirms the cyclostratigraphic correlations between the subsections in detail. Rock magnetic experiments reveal that haematite is the main magnetic carrier of the primary component. The magnetostratigraphy of the OCS is correlated straightforwardly with the geomagnetic polarity time scale. This resulted in an age of 10.7-12.8 Ma for the entire succession, which is supported by fossil micromammal findings. In addition, it also reveals the presence of two, possibly three, short new polarity intervals. Based on the number of cycles in the OCS the average periodicity of the basic small-scale cycles is approximately 23 000 yr, while the large-scale cycle indicates a periodicity of 400 000 yr. This suggests that these sedimentary cycles are controlled by astronomically induced climate changes causing lake-level fluctuations and thus resulting in the deposition of carbonate-clay cycles. The continental sequences of the OCS provide a unique opportunity to extend the astronomical polarity time scale into the middle Miocene. The overlap of such continental sequences in the Mediterranean area with time-equivalent astronomically induced marine sequences is fundamental for establishing marine-continental, bed-to-bed, correlations and for understanding regional climate change.

Of 69 species and/or genera of spring-late summer herbaceous flora recorded, only four species' abundances differed among stand-ages surveyed. Disporum lanuginosum was more abundant in older stands than in younger stands. Tiarella cordifolia was absent in 25-year-old stands, but common in 15, 50, and \u226585-year-old stands, and Lysimachia quadrifolia and Potentilla canadensis were more common in 25-year-old stands than in older stands and 15-year-old stands. Species richness, diversity, and evenness values did not differ by stand-age. Stand characteristics and landform variables that were related to herb species richness, diversity, and evenness values included stand basal area, mean percent canopy cover, extent of connected cove habitat, and area of cove habitat within I km radius of surveyed stands. Our results indicate that landscape measures such as patch size or extent of similar habitat, and connectivity to other suitable patches or habitats may be important considerations for assessing understory herbaceous community recovery following disturbances such as forest management activities.",

        "Absrtact": "A process model is described for the grain selection occurring during the solidification of single crystal investment castings, which are now used widely for a number of critical applications in gas turbine engines. The basis of the model is a thermal analysis of the heat transfer in the vicinity of the chill region onto which the molten metal is poured. Subsequently the competitive growth of grains during directional solidification is simulated via a cellular-automaton technique. For the purpose of model validation, processing trials have been carried out on a commercial single crystal casting furnace. The thermal cycles set up in and around the vicinity of the grain selector have been measured, and these are used to choose a number of critical parameters in the thermal model. The evolution of grain structure during competitive growth has been characterised using a number of analytical techniques, including orientation imaging microscopy. The results are compared critically with the predictions from the model. It is shown that the model is able to reproduce the statistical distribution describing the final casting orientation, measured with respect to the \u3008001\u3009 crystallographic pole. The model is used to study the geometrical factors influencing competitive growth and the efficacy of two designs of grain selector, and in particular the conferral of any control of the secondary \u3008001\u3009 orientation.

Difficulties in acceptance of the technique and interpretation of the results remain, due to its qualitative nature. In this study we have addressed this problem by the construction and evaluation of a quantitative standard for incorporation into test DNA samples. The standard was based on a naturally occurring 16S rRNA gene carried by the X-endosymbiont of the psyllid Anomoneura mori, a \u03b3-proteobacterium. This sequence is the most AT-rich 16S rDNA gene recovered from any cultured organism or environmental sample described to date, and a specifically amplified rDNA fragment denatured under exceptionally low stringency denaturing conditions. The native sequence was modified to incorporate perfect matches to the PCR primers used. The efficiency of amplification of this standard in comparison to a range of 16S rDNA sequences and the errors involved in enumerating template molecules under a range of PCR conditions are demonstrated and quantified. Tests indicated that highly accurate counts of released target molecules from a range of bacterial cells could be achieved in both laboratory mixtures and compost.

Computation of complete synthetic seismograms for laterally heterogenous models using the Direct Solution Method. Geophys. J. Int. 130, 1-16] for 1- and 3-D models, respectively. In this study we greatly reduce the CPU time by treating the laterally heterogeneous structure as a perturbation to a spherically symmetric model (i.e., using the Born approximation). Note, however, that (1) our methods do not require the use of the Born approximation and (2) the reference model for the Born approximation is not required to be spherically symmetric. The synthetic seismograms in this paper are computed using the first-order Born approximation. However, accuracy can be greatly improved by using higher order terms of the Born series; theoretical results are presented in this paper, and some preliminary numerical examples are presented in this volume by Igel et al.

        "Absrtact": "Most amino acids are specified by more than one trinucleotide codon. Here we show that amino acids of differing functional importance may be distinguished by the pattern of synonymous codon usage. GC-rich genes tend to be of a greater transcriptional (p < 0.01) and mitogenic (p < 0.0001) significance than AT-rich genes, consistent with GC\u2192AT mutational drift in methylated genomic regions. Third-base GC retention also identifies critical amino acids within individual proteins, as indicated by non-random patterns of codon variation between gene homologs and also by differential sequelae of site-directed mutagenesis. Sequence analysis of human receptor tyrosine kinase genes confirms that functionally important transmembrane hydrophobic amino acids are specified by codons containing GC third bases more often than are transmembrane neutral amino acids (\u03c72=134.2). Amino acids encoded by GC third bases thus appear more tightly linked to cell function and survival than are those encoded by AT third bases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "It is generally accepted that the incidence of whiplash associated disorders is increasing in all industrialised countries, despite the almost universal fitment of head restraints in at least the front seats of cars. This is usually attributed to the fact that few people can be observed to follow the standard recommendations as regards head restraint positioning, that is, level with the head vertically and as close to the head as possible horizontally. This study set out to determine whether any other factors, in addition to head restraint adjustment, could be found which would influence the severity of whiplash injury. This was done by linking medical assessment of real-world accident victims with engineering assessment of the accident vehicles. A random sample of road accident victims suffering from whiplash associated disorder was studied. The vehicles they had been travelling in were examined to assess impact severity and, where possible, measurements were made of seat and head restraint adjustment with the subject sitting in the vehicle. All subjects were interviewed to assess the disability resulting from their injuries, and their progress was followed for 12 months. The results were subjected to statistical analysis to try to determine relationships between severity of injury (as measured by resultant disability) and a number of occupant- and vehicle-related factors. A significant proportion of the sample had suffered lumbar strain injury in addition to whiplash, and these were excluded from the present analysis. Frontal impact victims suffered symptoms indistinguishable from those of rear impact victims. The beneficial effects of good head restraint adjustment could not be clearly demonstrated, and some trends, especially in rear impacts, where the benefits of a well-adjusted restraint should have been very clear, indicated that larger distances from head to restraint were associated with lower disability. The paper discusses these counter-intuitive results and their implications. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Two new mononuclear iron complexes, [(LBzl2)Fe(II)Cl2]\u00b7H2O and [(LBzl2) Fe(III)Cl2]\u00b7PF6, (LBzl2 = N,N'-bisbenzyl-N,N'-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethane-1,2-diamine) have been synthesised in view of generating complexes to mimic the active site of methane monooxygenase. Their structures have been determined by X-ray analysis. In both species, the iron atom shows a pseudo-octahedral coordination with two pyridine nitrogen atoms in axial positions and two amine nitrogen atoms in the equatorial plane. Two other equatorial positions are occupied by chloride ions. The coordination bond lengths clearly indicate the sensitivity of the ligand to the oxidation state of the iron. Thus, the Fe-N and Fe-Cl bond distances in Fe(II) complex are more elongated than corresponding distances in Fe(III). A statistical examination of the bond distances of hexacoordinated Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes using the Cambridge Structural Database provides evidence to relate both complexes to their spin state. The redox potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple was determined by cyclic voltammetry. The UV-Vis spectra are dominated by charge transfer transitions. The X-band EPR spectrum of [(LBzl2) FeCl2]\u00b7PF6 is characteristic of an S = 5/2 species with an unusual zero-field splitting. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.",

We have purified and crystallized recombinant AdSS from Arabidopsis thaliana and Tritium aestivum, expressed in Escherichia coli. The structures of A. thaliana and T. aestivum AdSS in complex with GDP were solved at 2.9 \u00c5 and 3.0 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. Comparison with the known structures from E. coli reveals that the overall fold is very similar to that of the E. coli protein. The longer N terminus in the plant sequences is at the same place as the longer C terminus of the E. coli sequence in the 3D structure. The GDP-binding sites have one additional hydrogen-bonding partner, which is a plausible explanation for the lower K(m) value. Due to its special position, this partner may also enable GTP to initiate a conformational change, which was, in E. coli AdSS, exclusively activated by ligands at the IMP-binding site. The dimer interfaces show up to six hydrogen bonds and six salt-bridges more than in the E. coli structure, although the contact areas have approximately the same size. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Diabetes is a common cause of kidney failure and blindness among young adults, particularly of African-American descent. Since glycemic control is a predictor of diabetes complications, we evaluated the impact of multiple factors including a special multidisciplinary management program on glycosylated hemoglobin in children with Type 1 diabetes. Data was collected from pediatric diabetes clinics in New Orleans, LA and Baltimore, MD. In New Orleans, hemoglobin A(1c) was higher in African-American patients 12.5 \u00b1 3.3% (n = 71) vs. 10.7 \u00b1 2.1% (n = 80) in Caucasian children, p < 0.0001. Longer duration of diabetes was also associated with higher hemoglobin A(1c) in both races. The effect of race on hemoglobin A(1c) was independent of the influence of sex, insurance status, body mass index (BMI) z-score, and number of clinic visits. Covariate analysis with mean blood glucose levels indicated that higher hemoglobin A(1c) was attributable to higher mean blood glucose levels in African-American children. From the Baltimore data, a multidisciplinary intervention program led to improved total glycosylated hemoglobin for Caucasian patients but not for African-American children. Poorer glycemic control of African-American children is likely to predispose them to a higher likelihood of developing microvascular complications as they mature. Standard hospital-based multidisciplinary programming for diabetes management may have limited effectiveness in improving glycemic control of African-American children with diabetes. Innovative intervention programs are needed for these high-risk patients. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "Large concentrations of the \u03b2-amino acid, taurine, can be found in many forebrain areas such as the basolateral amygdala, a portion of the limbic forebrain intimately associated with the regulation of fear/anxiety-like behaviors. In addition to its cytoprotective and osmoregulatory roles, taurine may also serve as an agonist at GABA(A)- and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. In this latter context, the present study demonstrates that application of taurine to acutely isolated neurons from the basolateral amygdala of adult rats causes significant alterations in resting membrane current, as measured by whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Using standard pharmacological approaches, we find that currents gated by concentrations of taurine \u22643 mM are predominantly mediated by strychnine-sensitive receptors. Furthermore, these strychnine-sensitive receptors are shown to be pharmacologically and biophysically similar to 'classic' strychnine-sensitive, chloride-conducting glycine receptors expressed in brainstem and spinal cord. While amygdala glycine receptors can be distinguished from GABA(A) receptors expressed by the same neurons, these two chloride channels are functionally expressed at comparable levels. Given that a number of clinically relevant compounds are associated with the regulation of GABA(A) receptors in this brain region, the presence of both strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors and their agonist, taurine, in the basolateral amygdala may suggest an important role for these receptors in the limbic forebrain of adult rats.

        "Absrtact": "Interannual variability (IAV) of net vertical heat flux (Q), potential energy anomaly or 'stratification index' (V) and date of onset for water column stratification were studied using five-day averaged model output over an 11 yr (1985-1995) period for three depth zones which span water depths from less than 60 to 100 m on southern Georges Bank. Comparison between five-day averaged model Q estimates from this study and Q measurements from US-GLOBEC mooring ST1 during winter-summer 1995 shows that nearly all of the difference between uncalibrated model estimates and calibrated ST1 measurements is attributable to the difference between the sum of the latent, sensible and long-wave components (Q(e) + Q(s) + Q(1(W))) from each data set. Furthermore, there is virtually no IAV in residual five-day averaged Q(e) + Q(s) + Q(1(w)) values relative to the long-term (1985-1995) mean seasonal cycle, suggesting strongly that the calibration of model Q estimates using measurements from mooring ST1 during 1995 may be applied to other years (1985-1994). Calibrated long-term (1985-1995) monthly mean Q values from this study show a similar seasonal cycle to climatological values determined from ship-of-opportunity data. However, values from this study are higher relative to the ship-of-opportunity long-term monthly mean climatology, with largest differences occurring during winter. IAV of monthly mean Q for zones 1-3 on southern Georges Bank is significant with the magnitude of residuals increasing from zones 1 to 3. Long-term (1985-1995) monthly mean model-derived V computed for zones 1-3 shows zone 1 (< 60 m depth) remaining well-mixed throughout the year with no stratification development and therefore no detectable IAV for V. However, within zone 2 (60-80 m depth) and zone 3 (80-100 m depth) significant permanent stratification begins to develop during May and April, respectively, increasing almost linearly from May-July and reaching a maximum during July and August, respectively. IAV of V is large for zones 2 and 3 with typical standard deviations of 1000-5000 J m-2 occurring from late-spring-summer with the largest coefficient of variation during spring and fall. Results from linear regression for zones 2-3 show that IAV of V is controlled largely by IAV of Q, explaining up to ~ 80% of the variance, with IAV of wind mixing being of secondary importance. Results from model-derived five-day averaged V show that temporary or 'transient' stratification nearly always occurs in early-May and mid-April for zones 2 and 3, respectively, over the 11 yr study period and is associated with reduced tidal stirring during periods of neap tide. The mean date of first transient stratification for zone 3 coincides with the historical maximum abundance of early-stage (< 6 mm) cod larvae and copepod nauplii for Georges Bank. In addition, the historical maximum abundance of haddock larvae occurs on Georges Bank at the same time that permanent or 'seasonal' stratification is established in zone 3.",

An account is given of the way satellite remote sensing can be employed to infer these parameters, and of their integration into a land surface model to simulate the surface energy and water balance. Fractional green vegetation cover is obtained by means of the AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, adopting a simple linear relation between this vegetation index and fractional green vegetation cover. Soil moisture is retrieved using the SSM/I Polarization Difference Temperature, employing the dependence of the dielectric constant of the soil on water content. A demonstration is given of the implementation of these two parameters in a land surface model, running the latter for the temperate grassland area of the FIFE field experiment for a two-week period in summer. A comparison with observations shows that the error on the simulated energetic fluxes is of the same order as the estimated experimental error of ground-based flux measurements.

        "Absrtact": "Background: In cells lacking centrosomes, the microtubule-organizing activity of the centrosome is substituted for by the combined action of chromatin and molecular motors. The question of whether a centrosome-independent pathway for spindle formation exists in vertebrate somatic cells, which always contain centrosomes, remains unanswered, however. By a combination of labeling with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and laser microsurgery we have been able to selectively destroy centrosomes in living mammalian cells as they enter mitosis. Results: We have established a mammalian cell line in which the boundaries of the centrosome are defined by the constitutive expression of \u03b3-tubulin-GFP. This feature allows us to use laser microsurgery to selectively destroy the centrosomes in living cells. Here we show that this method can be used to reproducibly ablate the centrosome as a functional entity, and that after destruction the microtubules associated with the ablated centrosome disassemble. Depolymerization-repolymerization experiments reveal that microtubules form in acentrosomal cells randomly within the cytoplasm. When both centrosomes are destroyed during prophase these cells form a functional bipolar spindle. Surprisingly, when just one centrosome is destroyed, bipolar spindles are also formed that contain one centrosomal and one acentrosomal pole. Both the polar regions in these spindles are well focused and contain the nuclear structural protein NuMA. The acentrosomal pole lacks pericentrin, \u03b3-tubulin, and centrioles, however. Conclusions: These results reveal, for the first time, that somatic cells can use a centrosome-independent pathway for spindle formation that is normally masked by the presence of the centrosome. Furthermore, this mechanism is strong enough to drive bipolar spindle assembly even in the presence of a single functional centrosome.",

Over this same period, policy actions are anticipated which will reduce the internal European regional- scale ozone production capacity.

A global three-dimensional Lagrangian chemistry model STOCHEM has been used to look at the relative magnitudes of these two influences on the European regional ozone distribution under some illustrative emission scenarios up to the year 2015. Substantial reductions in European NO(x) emissions should bring a significant improvement in ozone air quality, but they may not be enough to keep future peak ozone levels below internationally accepted environmental criteria without action on the global scale to control emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors: methane, carbon monoxide, NO(x) and VOCs.",

The products of the three most closely related homologues are fatty acid binding proteins (LBP-1, LBP-2 and LBP-3) which contain putative secretory signals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these secreted fatty acid binding proteins comprise a distinct gene class within the fatty acid binding protein family and are possibly unique to nematodes. To examine the potential sites of As-p18 secretion, the expression of the putative promoters of the C. elegans homologues was examined with GFP reporter constructs. The developmental expression of lbp-1 was identical to that of As-p18 and consistent with the secretion of LBP-1 from the hypodermis to the perivitelline fluid. The expression patterns of lbp-2 and lbp-3 were consistent with the secretion of LBP-2 and LBP-3 from muscle into the perienteric fluid later in development. These studies demonstrate that at least some perivitelline fluid proteins appear to be secreted from the hypodermis prior to the formation of the cuticle and, perhaps more importantly, that this coordinate C. elegans/A. suum approach may be potentially useful for examining a number of key physiological processes in parasitic nematodes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Several sources of anisotropy are considered: the lithospheric deformation, the asthenospheric flow, and the occurrence of oriented melt-pockets in the asthenospheric mantle. Our results show that contrasted anisotropy patterns should be associated with the various conceptual models of rifting. Thus seismic anisotropy measurements may allow one to discriminate between these models. Anisotropy measurements in the Rio Grande, East-African and Rhine rifts suggest that these rifts formed by a transtensional deformation of the lithospheric mantle rather than by homogeneous extension of the lithosphere. Alignment of melt-lenses in the asthenospheric wedge may also account for a significant part of the seismic anisotropy recorded in the internal domains of these rifts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "Absrtact": "The distribution of surficial sediments and sediment dispersion patterns on the steep continental slope off Nice (SE France) have been studied using side-scan sonar, 3.5 kHz profiles, short piston cores and bottom photographs. The input of terrigenous material to the Baie des Anges, a submarine embayment bounded by two prominent ridges, is dominated by fluvial input from the Var River, the Paillon River being only a minor source. The Var River provides very coarse bedload material (gravel and cobble) directly to the head of the Var Canyon. Gravel and cobble deposits are found along the Var Canyon and the Upper Fan Valley of the Var submarine fan and have been shaped into gravel waves. The fine particles (suspension load) are separated from the coarse bedload upon entering the sea and form up to 60-m thick deposits on the uppermost continental slope of the Baie des Anges. These deposits are formed by settling out of sediment plumes. The presence of silt and fine sand laminae that decrease in thickness and frequency away from the Var River mouth indicate the influence of meso- and hyperpycnal flows on these plume deposits. Areas outside the Baie des Anges are not connected to major fluvial input and receive only hemipelagic sediments. These primary deposits are highly unstable and sediment failure due to seismic loading, sedimentary loading or undercutting is frequent. Sediment failure produces secondary sediment gravity flows that export most of the material to the basin, but also produce turbidity-current over-spill deposits on ridges bounding the slope canyons and on terraces within the Var Canyon. Slump and debris-flow deposits are also observed. At least some of these secondary flows erode the continental slope as cross-cutting chutes on the upper continental slope and erosional scours in the Upper Fan Valley demonstrate. Modem sediment dispersal patterns on the continental slope off Nice are proposed as a modem analogue to lowstand conditions on continental margins. In fact, the absence of a continental shelf together with a steep slope strongly reduces the influence of sealevel on the physiography of the margin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause that affects around 1% of the adult population in the U.S. Women are more often affected than men by a ratio of 3 to 1, and although the disease can appear at any age in adult life, the incidence and prevalence increase with age. The inflammatory process that characterizes RA, centers in and around articular structures and is characterized by destruction that progresses over time. Attempts to apply curve fitting to the analysis of the progression of radiographic damage in RA have lead to numerous forms of mathematical models (linear, quadratic, cubic, square root, first-order kinetics, etc.). None of these models has been very successful in that a significant degree of ambiguity of the appropriate model form still remains. A mathematical model of the progression of RA would be useful to evaluate the effect of interventions to ameliorate joint destruction. In this paper, we present a rigorously derived second-order kinetics model and propose (a) a possible explanation for the ambiguity found in prior analyses, and (b) present a potentially clinically useful model for RA disease progression based upon radiographic assessment of joint damage.

        "Absrtact": "Lowermost Silurian organic-rich ('hot') shales are the origin of 80-90% of Palaeozoic sourced hydrocarbons in North Africa and also played a major role in petroleum generation on the Arabian Peninsula. In most cases, the shales were deposited directly above upper Ordovician (peri-) glacial sandstones during the initial early Silurian transgression that was a result of the melting of the late Ordovician icecap. Deposition of the main organic-rich shale unit in the North African/Arabian region was restricted to the earliest Silurian Rhuddanian stage (acuminatus, atavus and probably early cyphus graptolite biozones). During this short period (1-2 m.y.), a favourable combination of factors existed which led to the development of exceptionally strong oxygen-deficiency in the area. In most countries of the study area, the post-Rhuddanian Silurian shales are organically lean and have not contributed to petroleum generation. The distribution and thickness of the basal Silurian 'hot' shales have been mapped in detail for the whole North African region, using logs from some 300 exploration wells in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. In addition, all relevant, accessible published and unpublished surface and subsurface data of the lower Silurian shales in North Africa and Arabia have been reviewed, including sedimentological, biostratigraphic and organic geochemical data. The lowermost Silurian hot shales of northern Gondwana are laterally discontinuous and their distribution and thickness were controlled by the early Silurian palaeorelief which was shaped mainly by glacial processes of the late Ordovician ice age and by Pan-African and Infracambrian compressional and extensional tectonism. The thickest and areally most extensive basal Silurian organic-rich shales in North Africa occur in Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya, while on the Arabian Peninsula they are most prolific in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Iraq. The hot shales were not deposited in Egypt, which was a large palaeohigh at that time. The depositional model presented may help in better understanding the source potential of the basal Silurian shales in less-explored regions of North Africa and Arabia including Morocco, northern Niger and the Kufra Basin in southeast Libya.

Although the Sr and Nd isotopic ratios are similar to those in normal mid ocean ridge basalt, the incompatible element signatures and Pb isotopic compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 18.7-19.8) show similarities to the high time integrated 238U/204Pb mantle component. On the 206Pb/204Pb versus 207Pb/204Pb isotope diagram, all samples plot below the Northern Hemisphere reference line (\u0394 7/4=-1.0 to -7.2) and form a 430 Ma isochron. The Pb, as well as Sm-Nd, isotope data are consistent with the presence of recycled Paleozoic (\u2264500 Ma) oceanic crust in the Madeira source. Variations in major element and isotopic geochemistry (e.g. positive correlation between SiO2 and FeO(T) with Pb isotope ratios in primitive samples) point to a heterogeneous plume source containing upper (primarily hydrothermally altered basaltic) and lower (primarily unaltered gabbroic) ocean crust and lithospheric mantle. The more fertile basaltic crustal component is preferentially sampled during the shield stage of volcanism, whereas the more depleted lower crust and lithospheric mantle components are preferentially sampled during the post-erosional stage. We propose that plume material becomes progressively depleted through melt extraction as it spreads out along the base of the lithosphere in the direction of plate motion. A systematic decrease in 143Nd/144Nd and increase in 207Pb/204Pb isotopic ratios with increasing age along the hotspot track and proximity to the Iberian peninsula are attributed to increased contamination by continental lithosphere.

        "Absrtact": "The morphometric analysis of submarine landslides in four distinctly different tectonic environments on the continental slopes of Oregon, central California, Texas, and New Jersey provides useful insight into submarine process, including sediment transport mechanisms and slope stability. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) software, we identify landslides from multibeam bathymetric and GLORIA sidescan surveys based solely on surficial morphology and reflectivity. This method provides useful data in a time- and cost-efficient manner. We measure various aspects of the failures, including landslide area, runout distance, and headscarp height, along with the slope gradient of the runout zone, the failure's scar, headscarp, and adjacent slopes. The largest failures of the four study areas occur in the Gulf of Mexico, adjacent to Mississippi Canyon, and between salt withdrawal basins. Smaller landslides occur within the basins, and at the base of the Sigsbee Escarpment. These smaller landslides tend to have higher headscarps than the larger ones, and often have cohesive material at the base, suggesting a stronger rheology. Oregon has the steepest local slopes, but surprisingly few large failures for a seismically active margin (especially in the north), implying that slope angle and seismic activity may not be the most important slope stability controls. The California continental slope is heavily incised, which makes failure isolation difficult. Most of the landslides occur within the larger canyons (Vizcaino, Pioneer, Monterey) and adjacent to a pock mark field in the Point Arena basin. The majority of landslides offshore New Jersey occur on the open slope between Lindenkohl and Carteret Canyons. Morphometric statistics give us insight into where mass movements occur, how big they are likely to be, their relative importance as sediment transport mechanisms, and the overall slope stability of a given margin. Most landslides occur on slopes less than 10\u00b0. Curiously, the steepness of the slope adjacent to the failure tends to be inversely proportional to the runout length. In both California and Oregon, slope failures tend to make the local slope steeper, whereas failures in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore New Jersey will tend to make the local slope less steep. Landslides with rubble beneath the scar are mostly smaller than those without, are deep seated, and make the slope steeper. We use the ratio of headscarp height to runout length as a measure of the failure's dynamic rheology. This ratio in the submarine case is orders of magnitude less than subaerial landslides. Hydroplaning of the failed mass may be responsible for the very long runout lengths. These morphometric relationships give us important insight into landslide dynamics and process in different sedimentary and tectonic environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Treatment of 2 with benzoic acid and with acetic acid in the presence of iPr2PCH2PPh2 led, after proton-assisted cleavage of the allyl-metal bond, to the formation of the bis(carboxylato)ruthenium(II) compounds 4 and 5a/5b, respectively. Similarly, the bis(trifluoroacetate) [Ru(\u03b71-O2CCF3)2(\u03ba 2-iPr2PCH2PiPr2)2] (7) was prepared and the molecular structure determined by X-ray crystallography. The reaction of 2 and 3 with hexafluoroacetone afforded the chelate complexes [Ru(\u03b72-acac-f6)2(\u03ba2-R 2PCH2PPh2)] (R = iPr 8, Cy 9) which were also accessible from [Ru(\u03b72-OC6Cl5)2(\u03ba 2-R2PCH2PPh2)] (R = iPr 10, Cy 11) by treatment with Hacac-f6. The preparation of the non-fluorinated bis(acac) compound [Ru(\u03b72-acac)2(\u03ba2-iPr 2PCH2PPh2)] (12), which could not be obtained from 2 and Hacac, was achieved by ligand exchange from 10 and acetylacetone in the presence of Na2CO3. The reaction of 10 with CO and CNtBu gave by partial opening of the chelate rings the substitution products [Ru(OC6Cl5)2(CO)(\u03ba2-iPr 2PCH2PPh2)] (13) and [Ru(OC6Cl5)2(CNtBu)3(\u03ba 1-Ph2PCH2PiPr2)] (14), the latter containing the unsymmetrical bis(phosphino)methane as a monodentate ligand.

This theory was applied to model findings obtained in an experiment that relates brain activity and behavior, the so-called Julliard experiment. In previous works of Jirsa et al. and Frank et al. the focus was on the brain wave aspect. Recently, we conducted similar experiments. The results obtained are modeled in this paper in terms of coupled oscillator systems. Coupled oscillator systems are considered to represent the Wilson-Cowan/Ermentrout-Cowan-model aspect of the unifying theory. Building on a model proposed by Haken, Kelso, and Bunz and the theory of weakly coupled oscillators established by Winfree and by Kuramoto, we derive a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation whose stationary solutions mimic the neocortical brain activity observed in our experiments. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Radon and its decay products escaped from two storage silos on the site of the former Feed Materials Processing Center (FMPC) near Cincinnati, Ohio, exposing workers and nearby residents. The releases began in the early 1950s as the silos were filled with 226Ra-bearing ore from which uranium had been extracted, and they continued at relatively high rates until mid-1979, when vent pipes and other penetrations in the silo domes were closed. Subsequent releases were at lower rates, and monitored concentrations in air at the site boundary have been near background. A dose reconstruction study sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated the historic releases of radionuclides and developed methods for calculating dose to individuals living in the vicinity of the facility. Uncertainties in release and transport parameters that propagated into dose estimates were analyzed and presented as distributions of dose to individuals with specified exposure histories. This paper discusses the use of data from the site and models of radon release and atmospheric transport to estimate distributions of working-level months (WLM) at locations remote from the point of release. Uncertainty in atmospheric transport contributes most significantly to uncertainty in predicted WLM, with nominal composite uncertainty factors of 4-5 (95th percentile/median) indicated for distances between 3 and 10 km from the source.

        "Absrtact": "A soil vegetation atmosphere transfer scheme (SVAT), describing the fluxes of heat, water vapour and CO 2 between a multi-component vegetated land surface and the atmosphere, has been developed. The SVAT has been calibrated and tested using 30 days of micrometeorological and physiological measurements collected over a sparse savannah in the Sahel. The model explicitly represents the four major functional components of the savannah: shrubs (C 3 photosynthesis), grasses (C 4 ), herbs (C 3 ) and bare soil. The leaf conductance model for the shrub, grass and herb components was calibrated against porometry measurements made in the field. The performance of the SVAT was tested against independent surface flux and temperature measurements. Agreement between the model predictions and measurements of the total net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, net CO 2 exchange and surface temperatures was good: in all cases at least 80% of the variance in the measurements was explained by the model. Separate flux and surface temperature predictions for the four surface components were satisfactory, although complete verification was difficult as data were lacking for some variables. Predicted water use efficiency (WUE) of the vegetation showed a strong, non-linear dependence on vapour pressure deficit, especially for the bushes and the grasses. WUE for the grasses was about three times as large as the values found for the bushes and herbs. A SVAT model like this can be employed to address the possible effects of CO 2 enrichment and climate change on the competitive balance between different species in a plant community or in research concerning productivity and water use efficiency in mixed crops, such as agroforestry systems.

The generalized maximum trace formulation captures several forms of multiple sequence alignment problems in a common framework, among them the original formulation of maximum trace. The RNA sequence alignment problem captures the comparison of RNA molecules on the basis of their primary sequence and their secondary structure. Both problems have a characterization in terms of graphs which we reformulate in terms of integer linear programming. We then study the polytopes (or convex hulls of all feasible solutions) associated with the integer linear program for both problems. For each polytope we derive several classes of facet-defining inequalities and show that for some of these classes the corresponding separation problem can be solved in polynomial time. This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment that is not based on dynamic programming. Moreover, for multiple sequences the branch-and-cut algorithms for both sequence alignment problems are able to solve to optimality instances that are beyond the range of present dynamic programming approaches. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Specifically, I treat both frameworks as implementing in innovative ways the concept of 'duality', the co-constitution of elements at one level and relations at another (higher or lower) level of social action. I show that there is a remarkable homology, at the level of their formal practices, between the mathematical techniques of Bourdieu and those of Coleman. New ways to implement Galois lattice analysis are among the gains of this inquiry. Applications are to relations among the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.

        "Absrtact": "A method for precise Pb analysis using a 207Pb-204Pb spike has been developed at Royal Holloway. Pb isotope ratios are calculated relative to 206Pb and are normalised in a run to an arbitrary 208Pb/206Pb ratio to permit good estimates of error propagation through the fractionation correction. While 204Pb/206Pb normalised to 208Pb/206Pb appears free from interferences and obeys power- or exponential-law mass fractionation within analytical error. 207Pb/206Pb shows systematic decreases with increase in 208Pb/206Pb at > 1250\u00b0C that are extremely difficult to explain by isobaric interference and may indicate abnormal mass fractionation behaviour. However, this behaviour is absent from plasma-source mass spectrometers. Correction for the effect improves external reproducibility of SRM981 from 96 to 82 ppm (1 sd. 33 analyses over 1 year) for 206Pb/204Pb, and from 64 to 43 ppm for 207Pb/206Pb. For 206Pb/204Pb, this external reproducibility is only about twice the typical internal error on a single analysis after error propagation through the fractionation correction. Relative to the fractionation-corrected isotope ratios, measured ratios for unknown samples analysed are significantly more enriched in the lighter isotopes than are runs of SRM981, indicating that corrections based on average SRM981 mass fractionation are likely to be in error. Acid-leached rock chips and acid-leached powders generally give identical Pb ratios within analytical error. However, re-analysis of samples previously published by several laboratories shows large differences, up to 30 X the supposed reproducibility of conventional Pb isotope determinations, probably related both to inadequate fractionation corrections and to environmental contamination of rock powder.",

        "Absrtact": "The Lamongan volcanic field (LVF) in East Java, Indonesia, consists of up to 61 basaltic cinder or spatter cones, a minimum of 29 prehistoric maars, and a central compound complex comprising three main vents including the historically active Lamongan volcano. The field lies on the Sunda volcanic arc and abuts onto the currently active Tengger caldera-Semeru complex to the west. Between 1799 and 1898, Lamongan was persistently active and discharged up to 15 lava flows of basaltic to basaltic andesite composition, which is probably more than what was erupted by any other Indonesian volcano in that period. Several seismic crises have been recorded in the LVF since Lamongan's last eruption. There are no existing records of cinder cone or maar-forming eruptions in the area. Despite the possible hazards posed by future activity in the LVF, the history and structure of the field have been subject to little scrutiny. This contribution presents the results of a detailed morphometric and volumetric investigation of prehistoric vents and historic lava flows in the LVF, using field data, historic records, satellite imagery and modelling of erupted volumes. A typical LVF maar is characterised as a crater with a diameter of 450 m; generated by an eruption with a model ejecta volume of 0.016 km3 dense rock equivalent (DRE) and a model juvenile component volume of 0.0096 km3 DRE. Diameter/depth ratios of some maars display a morphological freshness comparable to recently formed phreatomagmatic eruption craters elsewhere. The median LVF cinder/spatter cone has a basal diameter of 600 m, a height of 75 m, a volume of 0.009 km3 and a model total erupted volume of 0.014 km3. Variation in cone basal diameter to height ratios indicates that the age of some prehistoric cones may not exceed a few centuries, and morphological classification identifies the youngest prehistoric vents on the northern flanks of the central edifice. Historic activity from vents on the western flanks of Lamongan produced at least ~0.05 km3 of basaltic to basaltic andesite lava. Resurfacing rates at Lamongan in the 19th Century imply an age of ~ 900-2100 years for the surface of the volcano. The steady-state eruptive rate from 1843-1898 is evaluated as 0.025 m3 s-1, which is low in comparison to estimates from many presently active systems. Using eruptive rate and volume data, the age of the LVF is estimated as between 13 and 40 ka, placing it among the youngest dated Indonesian volcanoes. Complex regional tectonics in conjunction with magmatic pressure have probably been the major influences on the distribution of volcanism in the LVF. The occurrence of maar-forming eruptions may have been controlled by a porous substrate, possibly a deposit from the Holocene Iyang-Argapura complex to the east. Volcanic hazards from future eruptions in the LVF include base surges, ash flows, ashfall and ejected blocks associated with phreatomagmatic activity, and ashfall and ejecta from magmatic eruptions.

        "Absrtact": "The magnitudes and epicenters of Philippine earthquakes from 1589 to 1895 are estimated based on the review, evaluation and interpretation of historical accounts and descriptions. The first step involves the determination of magnitude-felt area relations for the Philippines for use in the magnitude estimation. Data used were the earthquake reports of 86, recent, shallow events with well-described effects and known magnitude values. Intensities are assigned according to the modified Mercalli intensity scale of I to XII. The areas enclosed by Intensities III to IX [A(III) to A(IX)] are measured and related to magnitude values. The most robust relations are found for magnitudes relating to A(VI), A(VII), A(VIII) and A(IX). Historical earthquake data are obtained from primary sources in libraries in the Philippines and Spain. Most of these accounts were made by Spanish priests and officials stationed in the Philippines during the 15th to 19th centuries. More than 3000 events are catalogued, interpreted and their intensities determined by considering the possible effects of local site conditions, type of construction and the number and locations of existing towns to assess completeness of reporting. Of these events, 485 earthquake with the largest number of accounts or with at least a minimum report of damage are selected. The historical epicenters are estimated based on the resulting generalized isoseimal maps augmented by information on recent seismicity and location of known tectonic structures. Their magnitudes are estimated by using the previously determined magnitude-felt area equations for recent events. Although historical epicenters are mostly found to lie on known tectonic structures, a few, however, are found to lie along structures that show not much activity during the instrumented period. A comparison of the magnitude distributions of historical and recent events showed that only the period 1850 to 1900 may be considered well-reported in terms of magnitude distribution. Each earthquake is evaluated for its 'quality' of determination based on the number of intensity reports. Earlier than 1850, the data collected are few and most earthquakes had fewer than ten reports. Good quality reports began to be collected from 1850, partly correlative to an increase in the number of towns and partly to the start of a systematized collection of earthquake accounts by the Manila Observatory. Parameters of these well-reported earthquakes may be used for conducting various seismological studies. Examples of how the parameters of poorly reported events were arrived at are also discussed.

Similarly, although neurons in sub-cortical auditory areas of other species have been classified into distinct categories, these criteria have not been applied in primates. This study measured the responses of single neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI) and the caudomedial field (CM) to tones and noise. Most neurons could be qualitatively classified as onset, sustained, or sustained-onset, but never as primary (VIII nerve)-like or chopper. Quantitative analysis showed a continuum of response types, from having only onset responses to responding throughout the stimulus period. AI neurons had higher firing rates that CM neurons, but CM neurons had higher firing rates to noise stimuli compared to tone stimuli, and a greater percentage of CM neurons had excitatory responses after stimulus offset. There were no differences in the percentage of neurons that had tonic or inhibitory responses. These results indicate that the responses of neurons in the primate auditory cortex are better described as a continuum rather than as discrete classes, and provide further evidence that auditory information is processed in series between AI and CM in the primate.

Five focus groups of physicians were conducted in the fall of 1998. The paper reviews the type of shifts and strategies physicians used to reduce the cost to the patient. In order to maintain access to care for the patients, the most common strategy used is to refer to different types of social structures in the health care system. However, a number of shifts related to drug or treatment choices were also identified such as prescription of older drugs, shifts to drugs having different drug coverage and cheaper drugs within a drug class. In a proportional system of copayment, the price level of the services (drugs or exams) clearly appeared as a determining factor to induce physicians' decision shifts. Overall, we also found that French physicians put higher priorities on the cost to society than on the cost to the patient in their treatment decisions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

These studies have demonstrated that quantitative assessment of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer processes can lead to a better understanding of the relationships between crop growth and water management. Information on land surface can now be obtained at a wide range of spatial (5-5000 m) and temporal resolutions (0.5-24 days). However, even though considerable progress has been made over the past 20 years in research applications, remotely sensed data remain underutilized by practicing water resource managers. This paper seeks to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners, first, by illustrating where research tools and techniques have practical applications and, second, by identifying real problems that remote sensing could solve, albeit with additional research and development. As freshwater becomes an increasingly scarce resource, all opportunities to better manage water uses, particularly in irrigated agriculture, must be taken. An important challenge in the field of water resources is to utilize the timely, objective and accurate information provided by remote sensing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Full depth Total CO2 (TCO2) sections are presented for austral autumn and winter (1992) cruises. Pronounced fCO2 gradients were observed at the Southern Ocean fronts. In the Weddell Gyre, fCO2 regimes appeared to coincide with surface and subsurface hydrographic regimes. The southern ACC was supersaturated with respect to CO2, as was part of the northern Weddell Gyre. The southern Weddell Gyre was markedly undersaturated. The great potential of autumn cooling for generating undersaturation and CO2 uptake from the atmosphere was demonstrated. In the northeastern Weddell Gyre, upwelling of CO2- and salt-rich deep water was shown to play a role as the horizontal fCO2 distribution closely resembled that of the surface salinity. The total uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the Weddell Gyre in autumn (45 days) was calculated to be 7 \u00b7 1012 g C. The deep TCO2 distribution noticeably reflected the different water masses in the region. A new deep TCO2 maximum was detected in the ACC, which apparently characterizes the boundary between the equatorward flowing Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). East of the Weddell Gyre, the AABW stratum is much thicker (>2000 m) than more to the west, on the prime meridian (<300 m). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Each variable was categorized into four ranks (0-3) of increasing risk for survival. Urodeles and anurans were treated separately for both univariate and multivariate analyses. The results confirm a general sensitivity of urodeles, although in many cases newts and salamanders may react more promptly to habitat alteration and human disturbance. On the other hand, the anurans, except for three species that are widely distributed and largely euryecious (Bufo bufo, Rana temporaria, R. 'esculenta'), appear more sensitive than urodeles for a series of factors. Some anurans (such as Pelobates fuscus insubricus and R. latastei) are restricted to low altitude habitats (which are in general more subject to alteration), or are restricted to islands. Conservation actions should be applied for protecting Salamandra lanzai, S. atra aurorae, the Sardinian plethodontids (genus Speleomantes), and Euproctus platycephalus. For the anurans, the most endangered taxon appears to be P. fuscus insubricus, while some insular species such as Discoglossus pictus, D. sardus, and Hyla sarda should be carefully managed by the creation of protected areas.

        "Absrtact": "To investigate synaptic mechanisms underlying information processing in auditory cortex, we examined cholinergic modulation of synaptic transmission in a novel slice preparation containing thalamocortical and intracortical inputs to mouse auditory cortex. Extracellular and intracellular recordings were made in cortical layer IV while alternately stimulating thalamocortical afferents (via medial geniculate or downstream subcortical stimulation) and intracortical afferents. Either subcortical or intracortical stimulation elicited a fast, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)-sensitive, monosynaptic EPSP followed by long-duration, polysynaptic activity. The cholinergic agonist carbachol suppressed each of the synaptic potentials to different degrees. At low concentrations (5 \u03bcM) carbachol strongly reduced (>60%) the polysynaptic slow potentials for both pathways but did not affect the monosynaptic fast potentials. At higher doses (10-50 \u03bcM), carbachol also reduced the fast potentials, but reduced the intracortically-elicited fast potential significantly more than the thalamocortically-elicited fast potential, which at times was actually enhanced. Atropine (0.5 \u03bcM) blocked the effects of carbachol, indicating muscarinic receptor involvement. We conclude that muscarinic modulation can strongly suppress intracortical synaptic activity while exerting less suppression, or actually enhancing, thalamocortical inputs. Such differential actions imply that auditory information processing may favor sensory information relayed through the thalamus over ongoing cortical activity during periods of increased acetylcholine (ACh) release.

        "Absrtact": "North Pacific Tropical Water (NPTW) is characterized as a subsurface salinity maximum flowing in the North Equatorial Current and is the main source of salt for the North Pacific. We briefly describe the climatological features of its formation and circulation, and then examine temporal changes in its properties associated with the climate regime shift in the 1970s. We use a variety of data, which include the repeat hydrographic sections along 130\u00b0E, 137\u00b0E, 144\u00b0E and 155\u00b0E meridians, the hydrographic data from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series, the World Ocean Atlas 1994, and available gridded data of wind stress and evaporation. The classical idea that NPTW originates from the zone of the highest sea surface salinity at 20\u00b0-30\u00b0N centered around the international date line and spreads along the isopycnal geostrophic flow patterns is confirmed. Further, it is shown that the meridional extent of NPTW along 137\u00b0E is from 10\u00b0N to 23\u00b0N on average and the highest salinity core lies at about 15\u00b0N and 24.0\u03c3(\u03b8), and that the portion of NPTW north (south) of about 15\u00b0N originates from the formation region west (east) of the date line. NPTW in the 137\u00b0E section changed remarkably associated with the mid-1970s regime shift. North of 15\u00b0N NPTW increased both in its salinity and thickness while to the south of 15\u00b0N only its salinity increased and its thickness remained unchanged. The westward geostrophic velocity is increased significantly in both the southern and northern parts of NPTW. The northern thickening and speedup and the southern speedup increased NPTW transport across 137\u00b0E. The changes in the thermohaline forcing such as evaporation and Ekman salt convergence in the NPTW formation region possibly contributed to the increases in salinity in the southern part of NPTW, but not to that of the northern part, On the other hand, the increased Ekman pumping accounts for the increase of the NPTW inventory and transport at 137\u00b0E. The increased salinity of NPTW at 137\u00b0E, especially its northern portion, was presumably caused by an increase in its formation rate rather than changes in the sea surface salinity in its formation region; the thicker the NPTW layer is, the saltier is the core that tends to survive the mixing processes.

        "Absrtact": "In the first part, the authors discuss the mechanical stability of dominant and suppressed Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) grown under differing thinning regimes with a focus on the stem shape and the mechanical properties of the standing tree. In the second part, they concentrate on the variation of the modulus of elasticity of green wood (MOE(fresh)) and the density within the stem to analyse the effect of the underlying patterns in variation of these wood properties on the mechanics of the entire stem. At the standing-tree level, the investigations comprised a morphological description and static bending tests on the trees to measure flexural stiffness and structural Young's modulus of the stem. Discs sampled from different stem heights were examined to distinguish between different tissues (cortex, wood, pith) and wood types (adult, adolescent, juvenile), and to measure quantitatively their contribution to the axial second moment of area of the stem. An analysis of the variation of density and MOE(fresh) within the stem was carried out on small wood samples cut out of stem sections taken from the same height as the stem discs. The flexural stiffness of the trees is mainly influenced by stem radius, resulting in a higher flexural stiffness for thicker trees. Independently from the stem dimensions, the structural Young's modulus was slightly higher for the suppressed trees within each site. In an individual tree the structural Young's modulus decreases with increasing stem height. The cross-sectional analyses of wood type proportions and their characterisation by density and MOE(fresh) showed that the distribution of adult, adolescent and juvenile wood within the stem affects the structural Young's modulus and the flexural stiffness of the stem. Finally, a method is presented that allows a re-calculation of the mechanical bending properties of the entire standing trees using MOE and axial second moments of area of the different wood types. Our results suggest that further modelling of mechanical behaviour of trees might be possible taking into account the composite nature of conifer stems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems are characterized by a diverse community of native groundcover species. Critics of plantation forestry claim that loblolly (Pinus taeda) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii) forests are devoid of native groundcover due to associated management practices. As a result of these practices, some believe that ecosystem functions characteristic of longleaf pine are lost under loblolly and slash pine plantation management. Our objective was to quantify and compare vegetation composition and structure of longleaf, loblolly, and slash pine forests of differing ages, management strategies, and land-use histories. Information from this study will further our understanding and lead to inferences about functional differences among pine cover types. Vegetation and environmental data were collected in 49 overstory plots across Southlands Experiment Forest in Bainbridge, GA. Nested plots, i.e. midstory, understory, and herbaceous, were replicated four times within each overstory plot. Over 400 species were identified. Herbaceous species richness was variable for all three pine cover types. Herbaceous richness for longleaf, slash, and loblolly pine averaged 15, 13, and 12 species per m2, respectively. Longleaf pine plots had significantly more (p < 0.029) herbaceous species and greater herbaceous cover (p < 0.001) than loblolly or slash pine plots. Longleaf and slash pine plots were otherwise similar in species richness and stand structure, both having lower overstory density, midstory density, and midstory cover than loblolly pine plots. Multivariate analyses provided additional perspectives on vegetation patterns. Ordination and classification procedures consistently placed herbaceous plots into two groups which we refer to as longleaf pine benchmark (34 plots) and non-benchmark (15 plots). Benchmark plots typically contained numerous herbaceous species characteristic of relic longleaf pine/wiregrass communities found in the area. Conversely, non-benchmark plots contained fewer species characteristic of relic longleaf pine/wiregrass communities and more ruderal species common to highly disturbed sites. The benchmark group included 12 naturally regenerated longleaf plots and 22 loblolly, slash, and longleaf pine plantation plots encompassing a broad range of silvicultural disturbances. Non-benchmark plots included eight afforested old-field plantation plots and seven cutover plantation plots. Regardless of overstory species, all afforested old fields were low either in native species richness or in abundance. Varying degrees of this groundcover condition were also found in some cutover plantation plots that were classified as non-benchmark. Environmental variables strongly influencing vegetation patterns included agricultural history and fire frequency. Results suggest that land-use history, particularly related to agriculture, has a greater influence on groundcover composition and structure in southern pine forests than more recent forest management activities or pine cover type. Additional research is needed to identify the potential for afforested old fields to recover native herbaceous species. In the interim, high-yield plantation management should initially target old-field sites which already support reduced numbers of groundcover species. Sites which have not been farmed in the past 50-60 years should be considered for longleaf pine restoration and multiple-use objectives, since they have the greatest potential for supporting diverse native vegetation.

        "Absrtact": "This paper reviews the major mechanisms that can give rise to various forms of variability in the ventilatory pattern. First, an elevated controller gain, coupled with the presence of delays and response lags in the chemoreflex loops, can lead to instability in feedback control and give rise to periodic breathing. This form of ventilatory stability can be assessed quantitatively by employing the concept of 'loop gain'. Several different methods of estimating loop gain from steady state or dynamic respiratory measurements are discussed. An inherently stable respiratory control system can also exhibit periodic behavior due to the influence of primary fluctuations in sleep-wake state and other physiological variables, such as cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. Self-sustained, irregular ventilatory fluctuations may be generated by nonlinear dynamic interactions between various components of the respiratory control system, such as the lung vagal afferents and the respiratory pattern generator, or through the propagation of stochastic disturbances around the chemoreflex loops.

In the self face exp. right limbic areas (hippocampal formation, insula, anterior cingulate), the right middle temporal lobe, left inferior parietal and left prefrontal regions showed signal changes. In the partner's face exp., only the right insula was activated. In the third exp., subjects made decisions about psychological trait adjectives previously categorized as describing their own attributes. Activation was present in the precuneus, the left parietal lobe, left insula/inferior frontal gyrus and the left anterior cingulate. A reaction time advantage was present when subjects responded to self-relevant words. The main area with signal changes during self-reference processing, regardless of the type of stimulus, was the left fusiform gyrus. The self-relevant stimuli engaged to a differential extent long term and working memory, semantic and emotional processes. We suggest that regions activated by these stimuli are engaged in self-processing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "In this study, variations in Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios in a Holocene Belgian speleothem (cave secondary carbonate deposit) are interpreted in terms of changes in water residence time and changes in weathering processes, possibly induced by changes in West European climate. A stalagmite from the Pere Noel cave (Belgium) was dated with the TIMS U/Th method and was deposited between ~ 13 and ~ 2 ka BP. The 1000 Mg/Ca ratio varies between 4.9 and 26, and displays short-term changes but no significant long-term trend. The 1000 Sr/Ca ratio varies between 0.09 and 0.31 and displays both short-term changes and a long-term decreasing trend from 12.9 to 3.5 ka. In parallel, the Sr isotopic composition of the speleothem decreases from 0.7090 at 12.9 ka to 0.7088 at 3.5 ka. The Sr isotope ratio is higher than expected from the overlying limestone (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7081) which implies an external source of radiogenic Sr, most probably from a silicate phase. Short-term and long-term changes in Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca as well as long-term changes of 87Sr/86Sr ratios can be explained by changes in the dissolution and precipitation processes of the host limestone. These processes are controlled by changes in water residence times linked to changes in the water excess (precipitation minus evapo-transpiration). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Reconstructions based on these and recently published rotation parameters document a relatively stationary position of Broken Ridge abutted against Central Kerguelen Plateau between chron 34 (83 Ma) and chron 20 (43 Ma), prior to the commencement of seafloor spreading between the two Late Cretaceous features. These reconstructions are significant as they are the first which are consistent with geological and geophysical constraints in not producing an overlap of Broken Ridge and Kerguelen Plateau between chron 34 and chron 24 (53 Ma) and not requiring significant extension or strike-slip motion within Kerguelen Plateau. We also find that the finite rotations for chrons 20 to 34 outline the area of rough topography inferred from the satellite-derived free-air gravity for the Diamantina Zone and Labuan Basin. A consequence of these rotations is that there is considerable overlap of continental crust in the region of Tasmania, the South Tasman Rise and East Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous. Solutions to this problem may imply either post-Santonian (\u226479 Ma) extension or transform motion in the Bass Strait, or late Cretaceous or Cenozoic extension in Wilkes Land. The reconstructions also agree with prior estimates of roughly 150 km of motion between East and West Antartica since chron 20. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Their ability to rapidly disperse and colonise disturbed habitats makes them important as a natural form of pest control, often present before other predatory groups arrive. This paper examines the distribution of Erigone atra and E. dentipalpis, which are amongst the commonest linyphiid species to be found on agricultural land in Scotland. The habitat preferences of these species were assessed using abundance and proportion data from 71 independent sites sampled using pitfall traps over 2 years and a selection of repeat first-year sites sampled during the second year, incorporating a range of land-uses from extensive moorland, through grasslands to intensive arable fields. E. atra dominated in autumn sown crops, and E. dentipalpis dominated at the other end of the agricultural management spectrum in low-intensity grasslands. Both species were considered absent from upland and moorland habitats. Linear regression modelling was used to create a model which best estimated the variance in proportions of E. atra in the catch across the sites using a selection of vegetation, soil, management and landscape variables. This model was based on data from 58 sites where Erigone species were abundant and explained 66% of the variation in E. atra. The variables included were increasing vegetation biomass above 50 mm and increasing levels of mixed grazing (both positive), and a combination of increasing plant species richness and vegetation stem density (negative). The efficiency of the model was examined using data from 13 sites which were sampled in the subsequent year to assess the effects of no changes and changes in land-use on the proportions of the two species. Only two sites were considered inaccurate (more than 20% different from the model), suggesting a relatively high level of accuracy. Interaction between the two species was tested for and not found to explain the differences in proportion observed. Comparisons with other studies were carried out, showing similar trends in proportions and in some of the variables identified as important. The influence of specific variables on each species is described in light of possible allometric-type effects, and the importance of these species for conservation and pest control in agriculture is discussed.

        "Absrtact": "Agroforestry is a young science in need of theories and methods providing predictive understanding. The present study is an attempt to contribute to the development of a general agroforestry theory and accessory methods. A tree-environment-crop interaction equation is derived in which the overall tree effect on crop production is explained as a balance of (positive and negative) relative net tree effects on resource availability to the crop. In this balance, each relative net tree effect receives a weight that is equal to the degree of limitation of the resource in the specific environment. The equation thus makes explicit that the balance of available resources in the environment is a major factor determining the biophysical outcome of an agroforestry technology. The equation enables the formulation of two rules that can be viewed as the agroforestry counterparts of classic crop production laws. The agroforestry counterpart of the law of limiting factors states: the more a resource becomes available in the tree-crop environment, the smaller its share becomes in the overall tree-environment-crop interaction. The agroforestry counterpart of the law of the optimum states: the more other limiting resources become available in the tree-crop environment, the greater the share of a resource becomes in the overall tree-environment-crop interaction. These rules help with extrapolation, without requiring full quantification of the tree effect balance. They allow the development of a method for the analysis and synthesis of agroforestry experiments. The method is illustrated by analysing some published alley cropping experiments. This analysis indicates that for alley cropping systems: (1) the hypothesis that trees capture nutrients below the crop rooted zone resulting in a net benefit for the crop is probably true for nitrogen and not true for phosphorus, and that (2) competition for water by trees probably exceeds their water conservation effects. Suggestions for experimentation are given and the circumstances under which yield benefits of agroforestry systems can be expected are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Soil erosion coupled with productivity decline is considered a major constraint to sustainable vegetable production in Southeast Asian steeplands, yet soil conservation technologies acceptable to vegetable growers have not been developed. Effectiveness of high-value contour hedgerows species [(Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.), pineapple (Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.), pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), lemon grass (Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees ex Steud.) Wats.), and tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze)] on control of steepland erosion was evaluated in a replicated researcher-managed field experiment, and 12 farmer-managed erosion-runoff plots from 1995 to 1998 across the landscape of the Manupali watershed in Mindanao, the Philippines. Annual soil loss from 42% slopes with superimposed researcher-managed high-value contour hedgerows treatment (45.4 Mg ha-1) was lower by 30% compared to the conventional practice of up-and-down cultivation (65.3 Mg ha-1). Annual soil loss measured in farmers' plots ranged from 1.4 Mg ha-1 to 52.5 Mg ha-1 on slopes ranging from 16 to 65%. Soil pH, organic C, total-N, and P downslope were greater by 7, 28, 13, and 10%, respectively, compared to upslope. Total-N, organic C, soil pH, Mg, and K measured at the end of the experiment in the researcher-managed contour hedgerows plots were lower by 45, 20, 30, 53, and 70%, respectively, compared to initial values. The Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model was used to assess the effects of annual cropping sequences under a contour hedgerow system on slopes ranging from 15 to 65%. The cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.)-tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)-cabbage sequence (the first crop planted in January) resulted in an average simulated annual soil loss of 28.1 Mg ha-1 across slope ranging from 15 to 65%, whereas tomato-cabbage-tomato resulted in an annual simulated soil loss of 98.3 Mg ha-1. The cropping sequence of tomato-cabbage-tomato lost 3.0 Mg ha-1 more soil at 15% slope than did the cabbage-tomato-cabbage sequence, while at 65% slope, the tomato-cabbage-tomato sequence lost 181.2 Mg ha-1 more than the other sequence. On average, two-thirds of the total soil loss occurred during September-December. In order to reduce soil loss and increase productivity in steep sloping lands, high-value contour hedgerows with sequential cropping sequences that include either corn (Zea mays L.) or cabbage rather than tomato during the most erosive period of the year and variable fertility management strategies along the slope positions are suggested. The coincidence of predicted to actual soil loss from farmer-managed plots, based largely upon model development from researcher-managed plots, and the acute awareness instilled amongst farmer cooperators of the magnitude of soil loss, strengthen the argument for farmer participatory research.

These methods are the ubiquitous daylight factor method, ADELINE 2.0, the classified weather data according to Herkel and Pasquay and two simulation procedures based on daylight coefficients according to Tregenza, namely ESP-r version 9 series and a new accelerated method developed by the authors. The new method calculates 145 diffuse and three ground daylight coefficients in a single raytracing run which considerably reduces the required calculation times for an annual daylight simulation. An explicit calculation of the indoor illuminances under all 4703 annual hourly mean sky luminance distributions from the Freiburg test reference year (TRY) serves as a reference case against which the other methods are tested. The simulation results reveal that the accuracy of an annual daylight simulation method is not necessarily coupled with the required simulation time. The quality of an annual simulation rather depends on the underlying sky luminous efficacy model and whether the method considers the hourly mean direct and diffuse illuminances for each time period explicitly. The two methods relying on daylight coefficients exhibit the lowest relative root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the straightforward office geometry. The results for the advanced office show that internal illuminance contributions due to external ground reflections are only considered by the new method.",

        "Absrtact": "Marine notches are groove-like features formed in rocky coastal outcrops in relation to past sea levels, and are widely used as indicators of rates and patterns of tectonic activity. Examination of uplifted notches in the complex plate boundary setting of northeast Sicily reveals the need for considerable care in their interpretation. Present notch-forming processes are dominated by carbonate dissolution, aided by microbial activity, as waves surge and recede at the base of the cliffs, and produce notches approximately 0.5 m above present biological mean sea level (i.e. above an organic constructional rim of coralline algae, used to define sea level). At sea level, dissolution is restricted through saturation and the bedrock protected by the outbuilding algal rim. This assemblage varies in response to fetch exposure and uplift rate, typically producing a complex band of uplifted notch features exposed above sea level. Correlations (based on height) of the shallow and discontinuous notch indentations within this band are unreliable. However, the upper margin of the band, marked by the roof of the uppermost notch, is a prominent and laterally persistent feature easily recognised as the boundary between subaerial and marine processes. We propose that this is an approximately coeval datum formed when post glacial sea-level rise decelerated in the mid Holocene to match the rate of tectonic uplift, a notion strengthened by the available dates of about 5 ka for this feature. Subsequent uplift outpaced later sea-level rise, taking the notches above sea level. This proposed datum varies in height from about 2 m at Capo Milazzo (on the north coast) to about 5 m on the east coast bordered by the Messina fault system. The height differential is consistent with the respective elevations of nearby marine terraces dating from the last interglacial at about 125 ka, but also exhibits shorter term variations suggesting Holocene increases in activity rates on more localised structures affecting the localities involved. Regionally, northeast Sicily is characterised by long term differential uplift rather than behaving as a coherent block. The highest uplift rate, probably exceeding 2 mm a-1 (calculated using the sea-level curve from Fairbanks, R.G., 1989. A 17000-year glacio-eustatic sea level record; influence of glacial melting rates on the Younger Dryas event and deep-ocean circulation. Nature 342, 637-642), is suggested for a notch locality on the upthrown side of the Malta Escarpment. Rates of about 2 mm a-1 are indicated by the 5 m notch at localities bordered by the Messina fault system, and a rate close to 1 mm a-1 is suggested for the (undated) 2 m notch at Capo Milazzo. \u0169 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In this study (N = 42), we examined cognitive performance on a Stroop-like task, following either 3 min of hypocapnic or normocapnic overbreathing. Both overbreathing trials were run on separate days, each preceded by a baseline trial with the same task during normal breathing. More and other symptoms were reported after hypocapnia compared to normocapnia. Also, more errors were made and progressively slower reaction times (RT's) were observed during recovery from hypocapnia. These performance deficits were only found in participants characterized by apneas. The number of symptoms did not correlate with RT's or errors. The pattern of data suggested that hypoxia, as a result of apneas during recovery from hypocapnia, caused the cognitive performance deficit. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The last step, the phosphorylation of carbamate, is also catalyzed by carbamate kinase (CK), an enzyme used by microorganisms to produce ATP from ADP and CP. Although the recently determined structures of CPS and CK show no obvious mutual similarities, a CK-like CPS reported in hyperthermophilic archaea was postulated to be a missing link in the evolution of CP biosynthesis. The 1.5 \u00c5 resolution structure of this enzyme from Pyrococcus furiosus shows both a subunit topology and a homodimeric molecular organization, with a 16-stranded open \u03b2-sheet core surrounded by \u03b1-helices, similar to those in CK. However, the pyrococcal enzyme exhibits many solvent-accessible ion-pairs, an extensive, strongly hydrophobic, intersubunit surface, and presents a bound ADP molecule, which does not dissociate at 22\u00b0C from the enzyme. The ADP nucleotide is sequestered in a ridge formed over. the C-edge of the core sheet, at the bottom of a large cavity, with the purine ring enclosed in a pocket specific for adenine. Overall, the enzyme structure is ill-suited for catalyzing the characteristic three-step reaction of CPS and supports the view that the CK-like CPS is in fact a highly thermostable and very slow (at 37\u00b0C) CK that, in the extreme environment of P. furiosus, may have the new function of making, rather than using, CP. The thermostability of the enzyme may result from the extension of the hydrophobic intersubunit contacts and from the large number of exposed ion-pairs, some of which form ion-pair networks across several secondary structure elements in each enzyme subunit. The structure provides the first information on substrate binding and catalysis in CKs, and suggests that the slow rate at 37\u00b0C is possibly a consequence of slow product dissociation.

The lakes varied greatly in location, size, depth, alkalinity and trophic status. There were distinct differences in the distribution of species and growth forms among the lakes. The lakes separated into five groups of characteristic species compositions. Alkalinity was the main factor responsible for the species distribution. Lakes of high alkalinity were dominated by vascular plants of the elodeid growth form, lakes of intermediate alkalinity contained a variety of elodeids and vascular plants of the isoetid growth form, while lakes of low alkalinity and low pH had several isoetids and bryophytes, but very few elodeids. Alkalinity is a close descriptor of the bicarbonate concentration, which is an important source of inorganic carbon in the photosynthesis of many elodeids. The species distribution was related to their ability to use bicarbonate and extract inorganic carbon, implying that the observed distribution has an eco-physiological foundation, though a substantial variation suggests an influence of phenotypic plasticity and local environmental heterogeneity. Trophic state also influenced the distribution of species, with very eutrophic lakes having only a few robust elodeid species able to compensate for turbid conditions, while small elodeids and slow-growing isoetid species were absent. The distance separating the lakes did not influence similarity in species composition among them. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Such a tool is applied successively between the images and their symmetric versions with respect to an arbitrary plane, both to realign the images with respect to the mid-plane of the subject and to compute a dense 3D dissymmetry map. Inter-patient matching is also used to fuse the data of a population of subjects. We then describe three main application fields: the study of the normal dissymmetry within a given population, the comparison of the dissymmetry between two populations, and the detection of the significant abnormal dissymmetries of a patient with respect to a reference population.

For example, a distinct spring bloom can be found in the Bering Sea while the standing stock of phytoplankton is somewhat constant in most of the subpolar gyre throughout the year. It is shown that physical factors determining the modeled seasonal variations are the annual mean vertical flow, vertical mixing, and, less importantly, solar radiation. The annual mean vertical flow can affect the seasonal variation patterns through modifying the relation between the ecosystem and the mixed layer depth (MLD). Various combinations of these factors result in diverse patterns. But it is possible to classify them in terms of the amplitude of the seasonal variation of MLD and the annual mean vertical flow. The results suggest that the difference in physical environments can yield much of the diversity of the observed seasonal variation patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The N and C-terminal tail domains of the core histones play important roles in gene regulation, but the mechanisms through which they act are not known. These tail domains are highly positively charged and are the sites of numerous post-translational modifications, including many sites for lysine acetylation. Nucleosomes in which these tail domains have been removed by trypsin remain otherwise intact, and are used by many laboratories as a model system for highly acetylated nucleosomes. Here, we test the hypothesis that one role of the tail domains is to directly regulate the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to other DNA-binding proteins. Three assays are used: equilibrium binding by a site-specific, DNA-binding protein, and dynamic accessibility to restriction enzymes or to a non-specific exonuclease. The effects of removal of the tail domains as monitored by each of these assays can be understood within the framework of the site exposure model for the dynamic equilibrium accessibility of target sites located within the nucleosomal DNA. Removal of the tail domains leads to a 1.5 to 14-fold increase in position-dependent equilibrium constants for site exposure. The smallness of the effect weighs against models for gene activation in which histone acetylation is a mandatory initial event, required to facilitate subsequent access of regulatory proteins to nucleosomal DNA target sites. Alternative roles for histone acetylation in gene regulation are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Despite the critical ecological roles of structural complexity, ecologically relevant quantitative measures of structural complexity that allow comparisons among forest stands are still lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a method that allows comparisons of structural heterogeneity among stands. To encompass a broad range of potential structural complexities, we simulated three spatial point patterns each for tree-size distributions from five inventoried natural stands. Forest structure was modeled and analyzed by simulating point patterns of trees and constructing triangular networks to connect neighboring tree tops to one another. This method is based on the concept of spatial tessellation of tree positions, where point patterns are converted into 2-dimensional nearest neighbor triangles. A structural complexity index (SCI) was defined as the sum of the areas of 3-dimensional triangles (with x, y, and z coordinates) divided by the sum of the areas of 2-dimensional triangles. Vertical gradients were defined as the maximum size difference among the trees forming a triangle, that is, the greater the difference, the greater the structure and the larger the SCI value. Patch-types were defined as classes of structural gradients at different positions within the canopy. More patch-types are also indicative of more structurally heterogeneous stands. Both the SCI and the number of patch-types and patch-size heterogeneity related closely to conventional descriptors of forest structure. While the number of patch-types and patch-type heterogeneity related more to the vertical component of structural complexity, SCI integrated well with both the vertical and horizontal structure. SCI and the concept of patch-types complement one another and can be used to quantitatively compare the structure of different stands. The applicability of this modeling approach in characterizing the structural heterogeneity of forests across spatial scales is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

This study is based on secondary data analysis of two NIMH-funded epidemiologic-services studies: (a) Alternative Service Use Patterns by Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance (N=936, ages 9-17); and (b) Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (N=1285, ages 9-17). Child psychiatric diagnoses were measured by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. Variables that indicate site of the interview and service system, as well as age, gender, and ethnicity, were used as covariates. Significant annual variations were found in symptom counts of overanxious disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, and major depressive disorder, with the estimated nadir in August-October. There may be weak seasonal variations in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with estimated nadir in August, oppositional defiant disorder with estimated nadir in August-September, and marijuana use with estimated zenith in August-September. Significant seasonality in alcohol, other substance use, agoraphobia, and panic disorder was not found. There may be an instrument-specific bias in estimated nadir. Real nadirs may be up to 3 months prior to the estimated nadirs specified above. Findings suggest that seasonality in symptoms should be considered when assessment instruments of childhood psychiatric disorders are developed, as well as when epidemiological and clinical data are collected and analyzed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

This article reviews selected data on the major and minor component composition of PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter showing quite major geographic variations in composition which are not reflected in the exposure-response coefficients determined from the epidemiology which show remarkably little spatial variation. The issue of particle size is more difficult to address due to the scarcity of data. Overall, the data presented provides little support for the idea that any single major or trace component of the particulate matter is responsible for the adverse effects. The issue of particle size is currently unclear and more research is warranted. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

To achieve that target, direct human induced activities initiated in the Land-use Change and Forestry sector since 1990, shall be included. However, the wording in the Protocol has caused confusion. The IPCC has been requested to deliver a Special Report on Land-use, Land-use Change and Forestry issues arising from this Protocol. In the present study a limited initial assessment of the implications of alternative interpretations of Afforestation, Reforestation and Deforestation (ARD), addition of the soils compartment, the selection of additional activities, and feasibility of monitoring was done for a limited number of countries. The results show that it is possible to keep the biosphere articles in the Protocol even though we had to make several assumptions concerning for example, areas of application and effectiveness of additional activities. The consequences of alternative interpretations for ARD have a large impact on the countries' assigned amount; varying from a compensation of 26% of total national emissions (Forestry interpretation for Sweden) to an addition of an extra 13% of the emissions (Global interpretation for Australia). Through selection of a large set of additional activities, most of the studied industrialised countries achieve more sequestration than the reduction of emissions they have committed themselves to. Methods for monitoring are available, but there is no one ideal method. Depending on scale and site: a combination of forest inventory with flux measurements and remote sensing is proposed. \u00a9 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

As a result of a major excavation of the entrance channel to Pensacola Bay, over 7 million m3 of beach-quality sand were placed long the easternmost 7.5 km of Perdido Key, adjoining the entrance channel at Pensacola Pass. The project included the placement of 4.1 million m3 of sand directly upon the shoreline in 1989-1990, followed by the placement of an additional 3 million m3 as an underwater berm just offshore of the beach nourishment project in water depths of roughly 6 m. Monitoring of the performance of the beach nourishment project and the offshore berm has been conducted since 1989, beginning with a pre-construction survey of the project area. Monitoring surveys have been conducted on an annual or biennial basis since that time, with the most recent survey occurring in July/August, 1998. Over 8 years of monitoring data indicate that the beach nourishment project has retained approximately 56% of the original volume placed within the 7.5-km project length. In addition, according to the latest monitoring survey, the dry beach width of the project, initially constructed as 135 m on average, is still 53 m wider than pre-project conditions. Approximately 41% of the originally placed dry planform area remains as of July 1998. The most recent monitoring surveys in 1995, 1997, and 1998 encompass the effects of two major storm systems, Hurricanes Erin (August 1995) and Opal (October 1995). Monitoring of the offshore berm area indicates only a slight landward migration of the berm, accompanied by a minor decrease in volume, over the entire monitoring period. The performance of both the beach nourishment project and the offshore berm appear to be significantly related to the two storm events, particularly Hurricane Opal, and the proximity of the project to the tidal entrance at Pensacola Pass. Comparison of the documented performance of the beach nourishment project to simple existing analytical models of beach-fill evolution have yielded encouraging results in terms of preliminary design aids for future beach nourishment projects in the vicinity of deep tidal entrances.

The experiences of cities in the developed world have usually proved inappropriate in developing countries and consequently new and innovative solutions are continually being explored for these cities. Geographic information systems and the underlying spatial data infrastructures appear to offer significant potential to assist in managing human settlements in developing countries. In examining the status of spatial data infrastructures in developing countries, the first part of the paper compares cities in developing countries to those in the developed world. It then highlights issues facing developing countries in establishing spatial data infrastructures to support efficient urban land management. The paper describes the Bangkok Land Information System as an example of a city attempting to use spatial information technologies to manage the urban environment. This case study, together with the experience of the authors, are used to describe generic issues involved in the development of spatial data infrastructures for cities in similar socio-economic conditions. The paper provides a technical and institutional framework for the development of spatial data infrastructures for cities in developing countries. The paper concludes by suggesting that simple, low cost, project oriented, easily maintained and user-friendly spatial information technologies have the best chance of success.

Four value system types were identified, and, as predicted, were shown to be differentially associated with all three ingredients of service productivity. These findings indicate the importance of the value system as a marketing and management tool, and underscore the need for services managers to determine the behavioral and psychological responses that define productive performance in their organizations and to diagnose and develop the value systems that will reinforce them.

Research over the decades has substantially improved physical understanding of noise-generating mechanisms, and various design concepts have been investigated to control noise radiation using advanced blade planform shapes and active blade control techniques. The important parameters to control rotor blade-vortex interaction noise and vibration have been identified: blade tip vortex structures and its trajectory, blade aeroelastic deformation, and airloads. Several blade tip design concepts have been investigated for diffusing tip vortices and also for reducing noise. However, these tip shapes have not been able to substantially reduce blade-vortex interaction noise without degradation of rotor performance. Meanwhile, blade root control techniques, such as higher-harmonic pitch control (HHC) and individual blade control (IBC) concepts, have been extensively investigated for noise and vibration reduction. The HHC technique has proved the substantial blade-vortex interaction noise reduction, up to 6 dB, while vibration and low-frequency noise have been increased. Tests with IBC techniques have shown the simultaneous reduction of rotor noise and vibratory loads with 2/rev pitch control inputs. Recently, active blade control concepts with smart structures have been investigated with the emphasis on active blade twist and trailing edge flap. Smart structures technologies are very promising, but further advancements are needed to meet all the requirements of rotorcraft applications in frequency, force, and displacement.",

        "Absrtact": "When an accidental release of a hazardous material is considered within a safety case or risk assessment, its off-site effects are generally assessed by calculating the dispersion of vapour from the site. Although most installations handling flammable materials will be in the open air, many types of plant, particularly those handling toxics, are enclosed, partly to provide some form of containment and hence, to mitigate the effects of any release. When such a release occurs within a building, the gas or vapour will undergo some mixing before emerging from any opening. The degree of mixing will depend upon the building geometry and the nature of the ventilation, which in turn may be modified by the leak. This situation is considered in this paper, with specific application to calculating the rate of release of a dense vapour from a building. The paper describes the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to modelling the release and mixing processes within buildings. Examples of validation calculations for simple geometric arrangements, as well as more complex geometries representative of an industrial site, are described. The results demonstrate the capabilities of CFD for this application but highlight the need for careful modelling of the near-wall flows and heat transfer, and need for an accurate fluid dynamics and thermodynamic representation of the release source.

        "Absrtact": "Picrites from Nuussuaq Peninsula and Qeqertarssuaq (Disko) Island, West Greenland, preserve trace element and isotopic signatures reflecting the composition of the Icelandic plume head. Os isotope ratios are low (187Os/188Os((i)) = 0.1272-0.1371) in terms of global plume related magmatism, and this is coupled with anomalously high Os abundances and radiogenic 143Nd/144Nd((i)) isotopes. Crustally contaminated basalts within the West Greenland sequences possess Os and Nd isotopic signatures consistent with mixing between initial plume head compositions and two discrete types of West Greenland continental crust. One crustal component is of a local sedimentary origin, and the other is typical of ancient felsic crust. The low Os isotopic signatures of the picritic units are considered to be those of the initial mantle plume. The fact that such low Os isotope ratios occur in sequences with high 3He/4He, and the non-systematic variation in Os isotopes with indices of fractionation/accumulation and Pb isotopes, argue against mixing with depleted MORB mantle or ancient subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The high Os concentrations in the picrites are attributed to high degrees of partial melting (>25%) of mantle containing no residual sulphide. This is consistent with models for plume heads in which anomalous mantle temperatures initiate melting at high pressures generating large degrees of partial melting. Unradiogenic Os and radiogenic Nd components in plume-related CFB magmatism may preserve contributions from a reservoir which is sampled only occasionally in young oceanic basalts. Such a reservoir shares Os isotopic features with the primitive upper mantle (PUM), which may also be manifest in the 'Kea' component of Hawaiian magmatism. Therefore, portions of the West Greenland continental flood basalt province arguably represent the first direct sampling of unmodified plume head material derived from the lower mantle or lower portions of the upper mantle.

The crystal structure reveals HlyE to be the first member of a new family of toxin structures, consisting of an elaborated helical bundle some 100 \u00c5 long. The electron micrographs show how HlyE oligomerizes in the presence of lipid to form transmembrane pores.

        "Absrtact": "Lakes systems respond physically, chemically and biologically to changes in climate and these responses are registered in many various ways in lake sediment records. This paper focuses principally on the biological record and describes recent research that aims to reconstruct (i) past variability in effective moisture, and (ii) past variability in temperature. Changes in effective moisture are manifested especially by changes in lake water level. In closed lake basins water level change can cause significant changes in water salinity that is registered in sediments by changes in the composition of fossil assemblages, especially diatoms. In open (freshwater) lake basins changes in water level are best reconstructed from the aquatic macrofossil record and potentially from the ratio of open water to littoral species of Cladocera, ostracods and diatoms. The most promising biological method for reconstructing past temperature is chironomid analysis, and a range of new chironomid-temperature transfer functions are being developed. However, biological responses to changing temperature are usually indirect as a result of temperature effects on water-column stratification, nutrient cycling and alkalinity generation, and in most cases a correct interpretation of the climatic significance of changes in the fossil record requires an understanding of the processes that are operating in the water column. A multi-proxy, whole-lake approach is advocated as the best way forward, not only as a means of reconstructing past climate but also as a means of assessing the impact of climate change on lake systems.",

        "Absrtact": "This paper forms part of an investigation of the water use by a hillslope agroforestry system incorporating Grevillea robusta, a fast-growing tree species, and maize. Soil moisture deficits were monitored using a network of neutron probe access tubes monitored weekly over 5 years, in plots containing either trees or crops grown separately, as well as grown together as an agroforestry system. The agroforestry system had the highest water use, the trees grown alone used slightly less water and a conventional maize crop used significantly less water than either of the treatments incorporating trees, leading to substantial losses of water from the system through deep drainage. Significant differences in surface soil water input to and uptake from the soil profile were observed over the relatively small distances between trees. After rainfall, the soil water content close to the trees (0.3 m) increased more than it did at a 2.5 m distance. This was attributed to stemflow, and it was assumed that increased soil water uptake at the same position was due to higher root activity close to the trees. The importance of stemflow to the further development and refinement of existing process-based agroforestry models is discussed. It was demonstrated that moderate pruning of the tree canopy, although reducing competition for light between the trees and crops (data not shown), did little to limit the water demand of the tree component, resulting in little or no recharge to the soil profile. When the tree canopy was more heavily pruned, following the example of local farm management practices, the water requirement of the tree component was reduced and the soil profile water storage was able to recharge following rainfall. The rationale for including substantial tree pruning as a part of agroforestry site management practices is discussed.",

        "Absrtact": "The Jalama pluton (JP) is one of the best examples of the late Hercynian two-mica granites of the Central-Iberian Zone (CIZ) of the Hesperian Massif (Spain and Portugal). This pluton is a multiphase intrusion that consists of three intrusive units: (1) the external unit (EU) comprises three main facies [a two-mica coarse-grained porphyritic granite (PG), a two-mica coarse-grained equigranular granite (EG) and a tourmaline-bearing-muscovite leucogranite (TL)] which define both vertical and horizontal zonation. The main petrographic and compositional characteristics of the EU can be explained by a fractional crystallization process that takes place in independent magma batches generated from heterogeneous source rocks; (2) the sillimanite monzogranite (SM) is distinguished by the presence of micaceous aggregates composed of biotite, muscovite and sillimanite. Based on major and trace element data the compositional variability within the SM has been ascribed to inheritance from compositionally heterogeneous source rocks; (3) the late leucogranites (LL) appear mainly as dykes intruded in the PG. From a comparison with this PG, it can be deduced that the LL represent derivative liquids segregated after important fractionation from magmas equivalent to PG magmas but at deeper levels. The most important implication of our study is that the Jalama granites were generated by partial melting of high-grade metamorphic peraluminous rocks that were compositionally heterogeneous on different scales. During this small-scale intracrustal melting event, temperature was the limiting factor for the degree of melting. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Three primary trends in standardization were considered, Open GIS, ISO/TC 211 and CEN/TC 287, and a generic-profile-product approach was pursued. The selected standard was DIGEST-C with a customized (and not modified) implementation version of an Urban VMap product. The customization process included the association of the schema available in the selected standard with the schema that have been used so far in Greece for cadastre applications. The utilization and implementation of the selected standard, intended to be a National Spatial Data Exchange Standard, has various implications, which are reported and evaluated.",

The greenstone belts are characterized by collages of oceanic plateaus, oceanic island arcs, and trench turbidites; these lithotectonic fragments were tectonically assembled in a large subduction-accretion complex. Following juxtaposition, these diverse lithologies were collectively intruded by synkinematic TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite) plutons and ultramafic to felsic dykes and sills, with subduction zone geochemical signatures. Intra-oceanic basalts are characterized by near-flat REE patterns, and Nb/U and Nb/Th ratios generally greater than primitive mantle values, consistent with positive \u03b5(Nd) values. They are associated with komatiites, the association being interpreted as an ocean plateau sequence erupted from a mantle plume. Bimodal arc volcanic sequences, trench turbidites, and contemporaneous TTG suites are characterized by fractionated REE, with Nb/U and Nb/Th ratios less than primitive mantle values. Mixing hyperbolae between oceanic plateau and magmatic arc sequences pass through the estimated composition of bulk continental crust, suggesting that crustal growth in the late Archean was by tectonic, sedimentary, and chemical mixing of oceanic plateau and arc sequences at convergent plate boundaries. Mixing calculations suggest that oceanic plateau and subduction zone components in the Wawa continental crust are represented by 6-12% and 88-94%, respectively. High Nb/U and Nb/Th ratios of plateau tholeiitic basalts are interpreted as a complementary reservoir to arc magmatism (low Nb/U and Nb/Th), hundreds of millions of years prior to recycling of oceanic lithosphere through a subduction zone (high Nb/U, Nb/Th), and its incorporation into a mantle plume from which 2.7 Ga plateau tholeiites erupted. The variably high Nb/U ratios of the plateau basalts are consistent with early extraction of large quantities of the protoliths (magmatic precursor) of continental crust from the southern Superior Province asthenospheric mantle.

There is little morphological variation among or within collections from these disjunct regions and sexual reproduction has not been convincingly demonstrated. All known locations - five collections (four along one stream reach) from southwest Tasmania, and one collection each from New South Wales and North Island - were sampled for molecular study. Trees based on the rbcL chloroplast gene and the limited ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 nuclear region show the Tasmanian collections grouped together, with the rbcL data supporting the New Zealand collection as a sister taxon, and the New South Wales collection basal to this clade (the unrooted ITS data are uninformative outside the Tasmanian clade). Because this phylogeny is strongly supported by the rbcL data, and the rbcL base-pair differences between collections from the three regions are large (4.4-7.7%), it is proposed that three genetic races be recognised within Psilosiphon scoparium. Due to the absence of corroborating morphological data and sufficient independent molecular data for complete congruence, these races are not given formal taxonomic recognition. However the phylogeny supports an origin for these genetic races prior to the separation of New Zealand from Gondwana. \u00a9 2000 Adac/\u00c9ditions scientifiques et m\u00e9dicales Elsevier SAS.",

In this study, I focus on the role of the annual cycles in mixing, sea-surface temperature and biological production. By integrating these cycles, it is shown that the annually integrated flux of CO2 can be written as F = \u03b1(C(T)/(W) - C(Eq)), where F is the mean annual air-sea flux of CO2, \u03b1 is an equilibrium rate constant (m/year), C(T)/(W) is the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in the winter mixed layers and C(Eq) is the dynamic equilibrium concentration for C(T)/(W). In the formula,\u03b1 and C(Eq) capture the influence of the annual cycles as well as the spatial variations in, for example, the alkalinity. I analyze data from the Ocean Weather Stations (OWS) in the North Atlantic and some results from the MIT biogeochemical ocean model to find adequate descriptions of \u03b1 and C(Eq). According to these model/data estimates, the influence of the annual cycles in sea-surface temperature and biological production on the dynamic equilibrium concentration is on the order of - 5 to - 20 and 0-30 \u03bcmol/kg, respectively. These numbers are not negligible showing that the annual cycles must be considered when analyzing the oceanic carbon cycle. The spatial distribution of the quantities C(T)/(W), \u03b1, and C(Eq) are estimated for the North Atlantic using data from the TTO/NAS expedition and a combination of model and data analyses. The air-sea flux is calculated according to the above formula, and the seawards flux is estimated to be 0.4 Gt C/year for the area north of 30\u00b0N. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Results from a detailed analysis of the French macroseismic database SIRENE96 show that geomechanical site effects (i.e. site effects due to superficial geology) can be statistically detected and quantified from macroseismic data. Our results are used to derive a predictive map of potential site effects in France and to check if site effects induce a significant overestimation of macroseismic magnitude of historical events. The key hypothesis of our work is that geological formations of similar age produce similar site effects because one expects the younger sediments to be less compacted, and therefore more prone to cause site effects. A geological formation is associated with each intensity using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the digital geological map of France. Two approaches are developed in order to characterise the intensity increase associated with geological formations having the same age. The first approach is based on the intensities that differ significantly from the average pattern, intensities which are labelled as anomalies. In the second approach, a theoretical intensity attenuation law is computed for each selected event only from observations located on formations older than 2 My. According to the results of the first approach, these formations are unlikely to cause site effects, and for the sake of simplicity they are labelled as rocks (younger formations are defined as sediments). The derived attenuation laws are then used to compute the residuals for each observation. Residuals are classified as a function of the age of the formations on which they are located. The results of the two approaches are in good agreement. No intensity amplification is detected for formations older than 1 My. For younger formations, the younger the formations, the larger the average intensity increase. The average intensity increase reaches 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 degree on the MSK scale for 0 My sediments. The results are better expressed in terms of probability: For 0 My sediments, there is an estimated 83% probability of observing an intensity increase; for 0.01 My and 0.75 My sediments, this probability is about 52%. The magnitude of the intensity increase is variable, but it is generally small: It has a 26% probability to reach 1 degree or above on the MSK scale for 0 My sediments and this probability falls to about 5% for 0.01 and 0.75 My formations. A predictive map of geomechanical site effects is produced by extrapolating the characteristics of intensity increases to all geologic formations of similar age in France. Glacial and fluvial valleys, already known as being subject to site effects, clearly appear on this map, as well as less expected areas such as the South Atlantic coast. Lastly, new estimations of macroseismic magnitude that exclude intensities potentially affected by geomechanical site effects are realised. A magnitude overestimation due to site effects can possibly exist, but it remains limited (<0.2). This result tends to demonstrate that geomechanical site effects in France do not significantly distort our knowledge of historical seismicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Predators can affect the vertical distribution of mobile intertidal invertebrates in two ways: they can (1) cause greater mortality of prey at certain intertidal levels, and (2) induce prey to seek safer intertidal areas. In this study, we investigate whether low-intertidal and subtidal predators affect the intertidal distribution of two congeneric species of small herbivorous gastropods of northeastern Pacific Shores, Littorina sitkana Philippi 1846, and L. scutulata Gould 1849. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that predators affect the distribution of these snails by inducing them to seek higher and safer intertidal areas. On a wave-sheltered shore in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, L. sitkana and L. scutulata were both killed by predatory crabs (e.g., Cancer productus) more frequently when tethered near the lower limit of their intertidal distribution (\u2243 1 m) than when tethered where they were most common (\u2243 2.5 m), suggesting that high mortality rates are partly responsible for the lower-limit of these snails' intertidal distribution. However, two field mark-recapture experiments indicated that the snails' behavioral response to predation risk also influences their distribution. In the first experiment, snails from the 2.5-m level (low risk) transplanted to the 1.0-m level (high risk) displayed a strong and consistent tendency to move shoreward, especially L. sitkana, some traveling 10-15 m in 2-3 days to regain their original level. These shoreward movements were especially precise in the northern part of the study area, where predation rates on tethered snails were greatest. Furthermore, larger more vulnerable snails were more strongly oriented shoreward than smaller individuals, indicating that antipredator behavior might also contribute to intertidal size gradients in these species. In the second mark-recapture experiment, we manipulated predation risk using small cages and found that snails exposed to the odors of C. productus crabs foraging on conspecific and heterospecific snails displayed more precise (L. sitkana and L. scutulata) and longer (L. sitkana) shoreward movements than snails held in control conditions. These results provide the first experimental evidence that antipredator behavior may contribute to the intertidal distribution patterns of littorinids. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "An intensive series of observations off the Holderness coast was followed by a related set of modelling applications. Observations included: aircraft and satellite remote sensing, H.F. and X-band radar, ship surveys and in situ instruments on the sea bed and at the sea surface. These observations aimed to monitor, over three successive winter periods, the dynamics and sediment distributions in the vicinity of this rapidly eroding coastline. Associated modelling applications included components simulating: (i) tides and surge currents; (ii) wave evolution; (iii) vertical distributions of turbulence and SPM (suspended particulate matter) and (iv) resulting spatial patterns of sediment transport in the region. Simulations of tidal currents confirmed the accuracy of such models, given accurate fine-resolution bathymetry and appropriate boundary conditions. New developments of WAM, the spectral wave model required for fine-resolution applications in shallow water (described by Monbaliu et al. [Monbaliu, J., Padilla-Hernandez, R., Hargreaves, J.C., Carretero Albiach, J.C., Luo, W., Sclavo, M., Gunther, H., 2000. The spectral wave model WAM adapted for applications with high spatial resolution. This volume.]) are tested here. A number of additional features pertaining to shallow water are revealed including the sensitivity to specification of wind directions and the excessive temporal spreading of short-lived distant events. Likewise, the application of the generic single-point models for vertical profiles of turbulence and SPM (described by Baumert et al. [Baumert, H., Chapalain, G., Smaoui, H., McManus, J.P., Yagi, H., Regener, M., Sundermann, J., Szilagy, B., 2000. Modelling and numerical simulation of turbulence, waves and suspended sediment for pre-operational use in coastal seas. This volume]), are tested and also shown to be appropriate for simulating localised resuspension of SPM. This simulation also illustrates how, in shallow water (< 15 m), tidal and wave dynamics interact with significant mutual adjustments and with first-order influence on stress at the sea bed and thereby erosion and suspension processes. Some preliminary simulations of net sediment movement are included, involving an integration of the above effects. These simulations emphasise how, in all but the shallowest water, the mobility of coarse grain sediments is limited to occasions of extreme waves. By contrast, the movement of fine sediments follows that of the residual tidal current streamlines, i.e., primarily longshore with attendant cross-shore dispersion. However, significant variation between closely-spaced observations indicates the irregularity and complexity of such distributions. It is concluded that because of the inability to prescribe the spatial distribution of available surficial sediments (including size distributions) such simulations can only be expected to reproduce the essential statistical characteristics of SPM concentrations. The availability of extensive remote sensing or in situ data can help to circumvent this problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.A study was carried out to quantify contemporary fluxes from a rapidly eroding coast to the adjacent sea and relate these fluxes to separate causative mechanisms via model simulations. For this study, the Holderness coast was chosen. The essential characteristics of the tidal and wave dynamics including their interactions were determined. These components were then incorporated into a single-point model of turbulence intensity and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations. Finally, a preliminary two-dimensional (2D) model of SPM transport off Holderness was established.",

        "Absrtact": "The position of the tertiary Levitt pair between nucleotides 15 and 48 in the transfer RNA core region suggests a key role in stabilizing the joining of the two helical domains, and in maintaining the relative orientations of the D and variable loops. E. coli tRNA(Gln) possesses the canonical Pu15-Py48 trans pairing at this position (G15-C48), while the tRNA(Cys) species from this organism instead features an unusual G15-G48 pair. To explore the structural context dependence of a G15-G48 Levitt pair, a number of tRNA(Gln) species containing G15-G48 were constructed and evaluated as substrates for glutaminyl and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases. The glutaminylation efficiencies of these mutant tRNAs are reduced by two to tenfold compared with native tRNA(Gln), consistent with previous findings that the tertiary core of this tRNA plays a role in GlnRS recognition. Introduction of tRNA(Cys) identity nucleotides at the acceptor and anticodon ends of tRNA(Gln) produced a tRNA substrate which was efficiently aminoacylated by CysRS, even though the tertiary core region of this species contains the tRNA(Gln) G15-C48 pair. Surprisingly, introduction of G15-G48 into the non-cognate tRNA(Gln) tertiary core then significantly impairs CysRS recognition. By contrast, previous work has shown that CysRS aminoacylates tRNA(Cys) core regions containing G15-G48 with much better efficiency than those with G15-C48. Therefore, tertiary nucleotides surrounding the Levitt pair must significantly modulate the efficiency of aminoacylation by CysRS. To explore the detailed nature of the structural interdependence, crystal structures of two tRNA(Gln) mutants containing G15-G48 were determined bound to GlnRS. These structures show that the larger purine ring of G48 is accommodated by rotation into the syn position, with the N7 nitrogen serving as hydrogen bond acceptor from several groups of G15. The G15-G48 conformations differ significantly compared to that observed in the native tRNA(Cys) structure bound to EF-Tu, further implicating an important role for surrounding nucleotides in maintaining the integrity of the tertiary core and its consequent ability to present crucial recognition determinants to aminoacyltRNA synthetases.

The intradaily volatility exhibits a doubly U-shaped pattern associated with the opening and closing of the separate morning and afternoon trading sessions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This feature is consistent with market microstructure theories that emphasize the role of private and asymmetric information in the price formation process. Meanwhile, readily identifiable Japanese macroeconomic news announcements explain little of the day-to-day variation in the volatility, confirming previous findings for US equity markets. Furthermore, by appropriately filtering out the strong intradaily periodic pattern, the high-frequency returns reveal the existence of important long-memory interdaily volatility dependencies. This supports recent results stressing the importance of exploiting high-frequency intraday asset prices in the study of long-run volatility properties of asset returns. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Plant macrofossils, pollen and spores, and Coleoptera remains were analysed from high altitude, lacustrine, interglacial deposits collected from La Cote, Val-de-Lans, Isere, western French Alps. The investigation concentrated on the second half of the temperate stage (locally called the La Cote Interglacial Stage). Palaeoecological, palaeoenvironmental and quantitative climatic reconstructions for the termination of the interglacial period and the onset of cold conditions are presented. Because the different fossils were affected in varying ways by taphonomic processes they provide a range of complementary data about the palaeoenvironment, and illustrate the importance of multi-disciplinary studies. As conditions became cooler at the end of the temperate stage the lake levels fluctuated, and the water's trophic status changed. The occurrence of Pterocarya and the dominance of Abies support a correlation with the temperate Holsteinian Stage (oxygen isotope stage 11). At the top of the core an interstadial event characterised by Pinus, Picea and Betula is represented. This could have occurred either directly after the La Cote Interglacial Stage or the event may have occurred during the following cold La Bourne Stage after a hiatus. The climate fluctuations represented at the end of the La Cote Interglacial Stage in the Val-de-Lans basin prompt comparisons with the end of the Eemian Stage (Late Pleistocene) and suggest that such oscillations are characteristic for the end of temperate stages. An understanding of the changes represented here aids the evaluation of present trends as we possibly enter the final phases of the Holocene Stage. Sites of this age and located at this altitude are rare in Europe; therefore, it is proposed that the La Cote site should be considered as a high altitude, alpine parastratotype for the Holsteinian Stage in western Europe.

In order to study and compare forest dynamics in disturbed and undisturbed stands, contrasted silvicultural treatments were performed between 1986 and 1988 in these plots. Taking advantage of this experimental design and of this large database, a forest dynamics modelling project was started in 1992. This paper aims at presenting the growth component of the single-tree, distance-dependent model that was developed within the framework of this project. This individual diameter growth model was built according to the 'potential x modifier' paradigm: it links tree annual diameter increment to variables describing tree size and instantaneous competition as well as the recent past evolution of the competition. Species information was also taken into account and resulted: (i) in the classification of tree species into 15 functional groups that are homogeneous for diameter growth; and (ii) in a definite improvement of model efficiency. Attempts to further reduce the residual variance through the use of soil and topographical information remained unsuccessful. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Variables within the system can be changing at rates that vary by orders of magnitude, not only at different times of the solution, but at the same time in different parts of the network. Therefore, an efficient implementation must be able to vary the solution step size, and do so independently in different subsystems. A single processor algorithm is presented in which each neuron can be solved with its own step size by using a priority queue to integrate them in the correct order. But this leaves the problem of how communication and synchronisation between neurons should be managed when executing in parallel. The proposed solution uses an algorithm based on waveform relaxation, which allows groups of neurons on different processors to be solved independently and hence in parallel, for substantial parts of the computation. Realistic test problems were run on a distributed memory parallel computer and results show that speedups of 10 using 16 processors are achievable, and indicate that further speedups may be possible.

Cells with different electrode thickness, initial salt concentrations, and higher active material loadings were examined using the mathematical model to understand better the transport processes in the plasticized polymer electrolyte system. A better description of the ionic conductivity is employed based on new conductivity data. Improvements in the agreement between the simulations and experimental data are obtained by using the contact resistance at the current collector/electrode interface as an adjustable parameter for different cells, whose values vary from 20 to 35 \u03a9 cm2 (based on separator area). The contact resistance is believed to originate at the mesh current collector interfaces. Reducing the salt diffusion coefficient by a factor of two or more at the higher discharge rates was necessary to obtain better agreement with the experimental data. Based on the experimental data and model predictions from this study, it can be concluded that the solution-phase diffusion limitations are the major limiting factor during high-rate discharges.",

        "Absrtact": "This article deals with the waste management of post-consumer plastics in Germany and its potential to save fossil fuels and reduce CO2 emissions. Since most of the experience available is for packaging the paper first gives an outline of the legislative background and the material flows for this sector. The recycling and recovery processes for plastics waste from all sectors are then assessed in terms of their potential contribution to energy saving and CO2 abatement. Practically all the options studied show better performance regarding these two aspects than waste treatment in an average incinerator (which has been chosen as the reference case). High ecological benefits can be achieved by mechanical recycling if virgin polymers are substituted. The cost effectiveness of reducing energy use and CO2 emissions is determined for a number of technologies. There is large scope to reduce the costs, with an estimated overall saving potential of 50% within one to two decades. The paper then presents scenario projections which are based on the assumption that the total plastics waste in Germany in 1995 is treated in processes which will be available by 2005; considerable savings can be made by moving away from the business-as-usual path to highly efficient waste incinerators (advanced waste-to-energy facilities). Under these conditions the distribution of plastics waste among mechanical recycling and feedstock recycling has a comparatively small impact on the overall results. The maximum savings amount to 74 PJ of energy, i.e. 9% of the chemical sector's energy demand in 1995 and 7.0 Mt CO2, representing 13% of the sector's emissions and 0.8% of Germany's total CO2 emissions. This shows that plastics waste management offers some scope for reducing environmental burdens. The assessment does not support a general recommendation of energy recovery, mainly due to the large difference between the German average and the best available waste-to-energy facilities.

        "Absrtact": "The Hong'an region in the Qinling-Dabie collisional zone in eastern China hosts a series of metamorphic rocks exposing a south-to-north distribution from blueschist/blueschist-greenschist, amphibolite, eclogite (kyanite free) and kyanite-eclogite to coesite-eclogite facies rocks that represent progressively deeper levels of the Mesozoic subduction-collision complex. The Hong'an area is interesting for three reasons: (1) it escaped the thermal and structural overprint imparted on much of the Dabie Mountains during Early Cretaceous intrusion of voluminous granites and granodiorites; (2) the high-pressure (HP) Hong'an eclogites are widely distributed, often preserve prograde crystallization histories and can be directly linked in time and space to the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist rocks exposed to the south; (3) the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist facies rocks are generally better exposed than their equivalents in the southeastern Dabie Mountains and offer some opportunity for simultaneous structural and metamorphic analysis. The Hong'an area HP rocks offer perhaps the closest approximation to a preserved snapshot of Mesozoic pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions attending early subduction-exhumation in the region, and are thus essential to generating a coherent picture of the dynamics attending both metamorphism and exposure of the coeval ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks. The purpose of this contribution is twofold: (1) to document previously unpublished metamorphic and structural data characterizing these HP sequences and their relative continuity in Hong'an; (2) to incorporate these data with recent geochronologic, structural and paleomagnetic information in the context of protracted, late Paleozoic through Mesozoic subduction, collision and exhumation. Metamorphism and exhumation of some of the southern Hong'an HP sequences appear to have occurred concomitant with oceanic subduction immediately to the west, and thus may have preceded widespread continental subduction/collision. Moreover, all of the HP-UHP sequences in the region were exhumed before the end of collision between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons at ca. 160 Ma. Exhumation of HP-UHP rocks both before and during continental plate collision is neither novel for central China nor for other HP-UHP zones, but is important to take into account when reconstructing the evolution of such orogens.

On Mount Kenya, the oldest moraines give ages of 355-420 kyr (Liki I) and 255-285 kyr (Teleki). Given the uncertainty in our 36 Cl ages, the Liki I moraine may correspond to either marine isotope stage 10 or 12, whereas the Teleki moraine correlates with stage 8. There is no evidence for stage 6 on either mountain. The Liki II moraines on Mt. Kenya and moraines of the Fourth Glaciation on Kilimanjaro give ages of 28 \u00b1 3 kyr and 20 \u00b1 1 kyr, respectively. They represent the last glacial maximum (LGM) and correlate with stage 2 of the marine isotope record. A series of smaller moraines above the LGM deposits record several readvances that occurred during the late glacial. On Mt. Kenya, these deposits date to 14.6 \u00b1 1.2 kyr (Liki IIA), 10.2 \u00b1 0.5 kyr (Liki III), 8.6 \u00b1 0.2 kyr (Liki IIIA) and ~ 200 yr (Lewis); the corresponding deposits on Kilimanjaro have mean ages of 17.3 \u00b1 2.9 kyr (Fourth Glaciation-Saddle), 15.8 \u00b1 2.5 kyr (Little Glaciation-Saddle), and 13.8 \u00b1 2.3 kyr (Fourth Glaciation-Kibo). These data indicate that the climate of the tropics was extremely variable at the end of the last glacial cycle. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Re-Os data are presented for bedrocks and bedloads of selected rivers from the Himalayan range, in Central Nepal and Bangladesh. These data demonstrate that the Os isotopic composition of most of the bedrocks is similar to that of the average continental crust. Notable exceptions to this are the black shales from the Lesser Himalaya (LH), which contain large quantities of radiogenic osmium. In the black shales, the Os is not concentrated in the sulfides, and may instead be associated with organic matter. Bedloads collected from rivers which include LH black shales in their catchment basins have notably high Os ratios (187Os/188Os~3). This radiogenic signature persists into the Ganga river. In contrast, the Brahmaputra river is less radiogenic, suggesting an ophiolite input in the headwater region. Simple physical mixtures of LH black shales with eroded products from the high range require unreasonably high proportions of black shale to explain the high Os ratios observed at the outflow of the range. Assuming that our bedrock and bedload samples are representative of the source region and the eroded mixture, respectively, this observation suggests that erosion may not be occurring at steady-state. In addition, mass balance calculations indicate that about 20% of the Os and 60% of the Re are carried in dissolved form, implying that chemical erosion plays an important role in the osmium budget. Finally, the contrast in Os isotope ratio between Ganga bedloads and bulk sediments in the Bengal Fan suggests that radiogenic Os carried by particulate matter and later remobilized may significantly influence the Os composition of seawater.

        "Absrtact": "Output from a 500-year-long simulation of a global climatic model coupled to a mixed-layer oceanic model has been used to investigate rainfall variability over the Sahel. As part of the natural climatic variability of this run, the model was able to reproduce a period of above average rainfall followed by an extensive drought, which has been a feature of the Sahel over the last few decades. These rainfall changes are shown to be related to characteristic Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The basic features of the simulated SST, rainfall and wind changes in the Sahelian region are in agreement with observations. Large-scale teleconnection patterns were identified via 1-point correlation maps, which demonstrated the dominance of the Pacific region. Concentrating on the specifics associated with the extended period of anomalous Sahelian rainfall, a contemporaneous period of exceptional SST anomalies was identified in the Pacific Ocean. A marked anti-correlation was identified between the long-term trends in these SST anomalies and Sahelian rainfall. The mechanism connecting these Pacific SST anomalies to the Sahelian region was identified to be the Pacific North America (PNA) oscillation. Quite different PNA patterns occurred for the extended periods of above and below average Sahelian rainfall. The PNA oscillation was found to influence the Sahelian rainfall via its impact on the North Atlantic Oscillation. The particularly extended period of Sahelian rainfall anomalies was additionally influenced by a synchronised temporal variation of the PNA oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation at this time. Thus, this particular simulation suggests that the recent anomalous Sahelian rainfall can be attributed to natural climatic variability originating with SST anomalies in the Pacific Ocean.

It forms a lense-like body 1.5-2 km in size that outcrops over an area of 300 X 200 m on the southern bank of the Imandra lake. Rb-Sr (379 \u00b1 21 Ma) and Sm-Nd (383 \u00b1 58 Ma) isochron ages of the intrusion coincide with the age of the Khibina and Lovozero complexes. A characteristic feature of the Niva rocks is their extremely high agpaicity and enrichment in Sr, Ba, Y, Zr, Nb, Rb, LREE, and volatiles. The mineral association in the agpaitic syenite is K-feldspar, aegirine-diopside, biotite, lamprophyllite, aenigmatite and shcherbakovite. Isotopic compositions indicate the absence of contamination by continental crust during formation of the Niva alkaline magmas. A depleted asthenospheric mantle reservoir mixed with a slightly enriched mantle component is suggested to be the main source of the Niva magma. A metasomatically altered garnet granulite xenolith from the western contact of the Niva intrusion contains a primary paragenesis of diopside, garnet and plagioclase with chemical characteristics similar to those in the granulite suite of the adjacent Lapland zone and lower crustal granulite xenoliths from Devonian pipes in the Kandalaksha area. Additionally, the granulite contains vinogradovite, neptunite, pectolite and natrolite which partially replace both primary minerals of the granulite assemblage and secondary minerals which were formed during a later regional metamorphism. PT estimates support the lower crustal origin of the xenolith. The U-Pb zircon age of the Niva garnet granulite is 2711 \u00b1 7 Ma. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

More impressively, the spatial-temporal regression with 14 variables displayed 8% lower SSE than a regression using 211 variables attempting to control for the housing characteristics, time, and space via continuous and indicator variables. One-step ahead forecasts document the utility of the proposed spatial-temporal model. In addition, the manuscript illustrates techniques for rapidly computing the estimates based upon an interesting decomposition for modeling spatial and temporal effects. The decomposition maximizes the use of sparsity in some of the matrices and consequently accelerates computations. In fact, the model uses the frequent transactions in the housing market to help simplify computations. The techniques employed also have applications to other dimensions and metrics. \u00a9 International Institute of Forecasters.",

Optimally accurate second-order time domain finite difference scheme for the elastic equation of motion: 1-D case. Geophys. J. Int. 135, 48-62]. This scheme was derived on the basis of a general criterion for optimally accurate numerical operators obtained by Geller and Takeuchi [Geller, R.J., Takeuchi, N., 1995. A new method for computing highly accurate DSM synthetic seismograms. Geophys. J. Int. 123, 449-470]. In this paper, we derive optimally accurate time-domain FDM operators for 2-D and 3-D problems following the same basic approach. A numerical example shows that synthetics for a 2-D P-SV problem computed using the modified scheme are 30 times more accurate than synthetics computed using a conventional FDM scheme, at a cost of only 3.5 times as much CPU time. This means that the CPU time required to compute synthetics of any specified accuracy using the modified scheme is only 1/47 that required to achieve the same accuracy using the conventional scheme; the memory required by the modified scheme is 1/18 that of the conventional scheme. We have not conducted computational experiments for the 3-D case, but we estimate that the CPU time advantage of the modified scheme will be a factor of over 100. The stability condition (maximum time step for a given spatial grid interval) for the various modified schemes is roughly equal to that for the corresponding conventional scheme.

        "Absrtact": "Organic conversion subsidies used in Europe are less likely to be politically acceptable in the United States, where organic agriculture development is market-driven. Persistent barriers to conversion in the United States include limited availability of and access to production and market information, training in management systems and cost of conversion-related investments. By determining whether these factors affect the requirement of a subsidy to convert, we can suggest whether U.S. policy makers need to provide subsidies to encourage conversion and identify policy variables consistent with market-based approaches that could stimulate conversion. A utility difference model is used with Swedish data to analyze factors that determine whether a subsidy is required to motivate organic conversion. The results show that farmers requiring subsidies manage larger less-diversified farms and are more concerned with organic inspection, quality, and adequacy of technical advice. Access to more market outlets and information sources substitutes for payment level in the farmer's utility function, indicating that services rather than subsidies may be used to encourage organic agriculture. To the extent that conditions are similar in the U.S. organic sector, market-based programs such as cost-sharing for conversion and market access improvement should stimulate growth of this industry.

        "Absrtact": "We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the Tetrahymena pyriformis mitochondrial genome and a comparison of its gene content and organization with that of Paramecium aurelia mtDNA. T. pyriformis mtDNA is a linear molecule of 47,172 bp (78.7% A + T) excluding telomeric sequences (identical tandem repeats of 31 bp at each end of the genome). In addition to genes encoding the previously described bipartite small and large subunit rRNAs, the T. pyriformis mitochondrial genome contains 21 protein-coding genes that are clearly homologous to genes of defined function in other mtDNAs, including one (yejR) that specifies a component of a cytochrome c biogenesis pathway. As well, T. pyriformis mtDNA contains 22 open reading frames of unknown function larger than 60 codons, potentially specifying proteins ranging in size from 74 to 1386 amino acid residues. A total of 13 of these open reading frames ('ciliate-specific') are found in P. aurelia mtDNA, whereas the remaining nine appear to be unique to T. pyriformis; however, of the latter, five are positionally equivalent and of similar size in the two ciliate mitochondrial genomes, suggesting they may also be homologous, even though this is not evident from sequence comparisons. Only eight tRNA genes encoding seven distinct tRNAs are found in T. pyriformis mtDNA, formally confirming a long-standing proposal that most T. pyriformis mitochondrial tRNAs are nucleus-encoded species imported from the cytosol. Atypical features of mitochondrial gene organization and expression in T. pyriformis mtDNA include split and rearranged large subunit rRNA genes, as well as a split nad1 gene (encoding subunit 1 of NADH dehydrogenase of respiratory complex I) whose two segments are located on and transcribed from opposite strands, as is also the case in P. aurelia. Gene content and arrangement are very similar in T. pyriformis and P. aurelia mtDNAs, the two differing by a limited number of duplication, inversion and rearrangement events. Phylogenetic analyses using concatenated sequences of several mtDNA-encoded proteins provide high bootstrap support for the monophyly of alveolates (ciliates, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans) and slime molds.

        "Absrtact": "Evaporation over the Mediterranean basin produces a salty water mass that overflows the relatively narrow and shallow Strait of Gibraltar. The outflow is investigated with the three-dimensional Princeton Ocean Model. The model makes use of a bottom-following, sigma-coordinate system and an imbedded turbulence closure scheme to simulate the bottom boundary layer. Starting as a channel flow confined by the sidewalls of the trench of the westernmost part of the Strait, the bottom boundary current descends the steep continental slope of the eastern Gulf of Cadiz. The flow is controlled by a balance of the pressure gradient and the Coriolis acceleration, entrainment and bottom friction. Downslope Ekman fluxes are largest at the shelf break near the entrance of the Strait where we observe the most pronounced entrainment of North Atlantic Central Water. Profiles of modeled horizontal velocity, as well as scalar and turbulent quantities, show a remarkable resemblance to observed features. The model reproduces the 'nose' shape of the velocity profile that is typical for a density current; below the velocity maximum, there is a well-mixed layer and a stratified shear layer exists above the nose. The evolution of water mass properties along the path of the outflow agrees favorably with observations and the sensitivity of the Mediterranean outflow (MO) to varying source water properties is investigated. The combined effect of initial stratification, differential entrainment, and routing by the topography leads to the evolution of the well-known two-core structure of the bottom layer. Whereas the upper part of the outflow continues to follow the continental slope northward in the form of a bottom boundary current after it passes Cape St. Vincent, the lower core separates from the slope and there is a lateral spreading of the saline and warm outflow water in the depth range of the lower salinity maximum (centered at about 1200 m). The outflow becomes hydrodynamically unstable and lenses of saline water shed from the core, carrying their water mass characteristic into the Atlantic. The model results confirm that the area of Cape St. Vincent is a prominent formation area for Mediterranean water (MW) eddies (Meddies). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The aim of this study is to contribute to the emerging field of health inequalities impact assessment. It develops further a conceptual framework that encompasses the policy context as well as the pathways leading from social position to inequalities in health. It then uses this framework for a comparative analysis of social policies and their points of potential impact on the pathways leading from lone motherhood to ill health in Britain and Sweden. The British General Household Survey and the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions are analysed for the 17 years from 1979 to 1995/96. First, the results show that the health of lone mothers is poor in Sweden as well as in Britain and, most notably, that the magnitude of the differential between lone and couple mothers is of a similar order in Sweden as in Britain. This is despite the more favourable social policies in Sweden, which our results indicate have protected lone mothers from poverty and insecurity in the labour market to a much greater degree than the equivalent British policies over the 1980s and 1990s. Second, the pathways leading to the observed health disadvantage of lone mothers appear to be very different in the two countries in relation to the identified policy entry points. Overall, in Britain, around 50% of the health disadvantage of lone mothers is accounted for by the mediating factors of poverty and joblessness, whereas in Sweden these factors only account for between 3% and 13% of the health gap. The final section discusses the implications of the findings for future policy intervention and research in the two countries. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "During the DIVA 1 cruise in May 1994, a series of 19 dives was conducted using the French submersible Nautile at the topographic highs of three volcanic segments centered at 37\u00b017N, 37\u00b050\u2032N and 38\u00b020N, respectively, south of the Azores Triple Junction (ATJ) on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Hydrothermal fluids were collected at the Lucky Strike (LS) hydrothermal field, discovered at 37\u00b017N in 1993, and at a new hydrothermal site called Menez Gwen (MGw) discovered at 37\u00b050N during this cruise. Both systems are relatively shallow compared to other MAR systems with seafloor depths of 1700 and 850 m. respectively, characteristics which make them unique among the already known sites on the MAR. The characteristics of the LS fluids are the same as in 1993 and include temperatures ranging from 170\u00b0C to 324\u00b0C, variable chlorinities lower than seawater, low hydrogen sulfide ( < 3.0 mmol/kg), high Ba concentrations (up to 80 \u03bcmol/kg), low metal concentrations and high gas contents, and distinct chemical end-members indicative of significant geographic control of the venting system. In contrast, the very clear MGw fluids at 37\u00b050\u2032N show a rather uniform exit temperature (285\u00b0C) and chemical compositions with chlorinities (360-380 mmol/kg) lower than at LS and corresponding lower concentrations of cations. H2S (1.8 mmol/kg), metals and silica (8-11.5 mmol/kg), due to the lower temperature (T) and pressure (P) of the system. In the two systems, fluid chemistry is strongly affected by phase separation. At the low-pressure conditions of these sites, phase relations in the NaCl-H2O system dictate production of an extremely low salinity. The higher salinities observed in fluids thus indicate that mixing of extremely low salinity vapor with single-phase hydrothermal seawater is the dominant process controlling Cl concentrations. Depletions and enrichments of elements in solutions are also explained by the involvement of fluid-rock reactions. The enrichment of Ba, K, Cs and Rb in the fluids is linked to the enriched character of these elements in basalts. Relatively high pH and Ca, low Li, Sr and metals are related to the highly altered basaltic substrate in the reaction zone. Low Sr/Ca and high Ca/Na ratios are explained by albitization within the crust. The increase of degassing when approaching the Azores may be related to the carbon-enriched basaltic crust near the Azores hot spot. Isotopic ratios show that CO2, CH2 and helium gases have a magmatic signature. Compared to other deeper sites on the MAR, all fluids collected at LS and MGw are gas-enriched, except for H2S and helium, whose both concentration and isotopic ratio compare well with other hydrothermal fluids. The high CH2 concentration associated with unsaturated hydrocarbons and the high CH4/3 He ratios also suggest a contribution of CH2 generated by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks by Fischer-Tropsch catalysis of CO2 reduction. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.

        "Absrtact": "Suspended particulate matter (SPM) strongly alters the trophic environment of photosymbiotic aquatic organisms. At high particles loads, phototrophic energy gains can be diminished due to light absorption by suspended particles, and stress from particle abrasion or deposition on tissues. However, energy gains are enhanced if organisms are able to use SPM as a food source. For photosymbiotic benthic suspension feeders, increases in SPM concentrations may require both phototrophic and heterotrophic acclimation to sustain a positive energy balance. This study provides an experimental analysis of the effects of contrasting light and SPM regimes on the energy budget (scope for growth) of two zooxanthellate corals (Goniastrea retiformis and Porites cylindrica). Using a factorial design in a flow-through tank system, corals were exposed for 2 months to shaded and unshaded conditions (equivalent to 3-4 m depth at 4 and 16 mg dry weight SPM 1-1, respectively) and a range of controlled SPM loads with a natural organic content (~ 3% w/w). In G. retiformis, rates of particle ingestion were a linear function of SPM concentration within a broad range (1-30 mg dry weight 1-1). After 2 months of shading, photosynthetic acclimation was significant in G. retiformis, but did not compensate for the reduced light level, as daily respiration exceeded daily photosynthesis. However, in response to the prolonged shading, G. retiformis more than doubled its rate of particle feeding. At high SPM treatments (16 mg dw l-1), sediment feeding by this species compensated fully for the 35-47% lower phototrophy in the shaded treatment. Due to both photo- and heterotrophic plasticity, G. retiformis gained tissue and skeletal mass at all experimental levels of light and SPM. In contrast, rates of particle intake by P. cylindrica contributed < 10% to the energy budget in shaded and < 3% in unshaded conditions. Feeding rates of P. cylindrica were half-saturated at ~ 3 mg dry weight 1-1, and four- to eight-fold lower than those of G. retiformis. Skeletal growth was sustained, but tissue mass and lipid contents declined in shaded and high-SPM treatments, and carbon loss due to shading by SPM was not compensated for by particle feeding. Thus due to a lack of photo- and heterotropic plasticity, periods of high turbidity resulted in energy deficiency in P. cylindrica, and high turbidity conditions appeared physiologically unsustainable for this species. This study is the first to show heterotrophic plasticity in a symbolic coral, and to show that such plasticity can offset stress from high particle loads. It demonstrates that changes in the trophic mode of some coral species are a mechanisms for sustaining a positive energy balance in turbid environments, thereby broadening their physiological niche.

The Central Zone is divisible into a series of low- to medium-grade granite-greenstone belts and high-grade metamorphic terrains containing reworked Archean material and late Archean to Paleoproterozoic juvenile igneous and sedimentary rocks which developed in intra-continental magmatic arc and intra-arc basin environments bordering the western margin of the Eastern Block. The basement rocks from the Central Zone, regardless of their protolith age, composition and metamorphic grade, record a metamorphic history characterized by nearly isothermal decompression (M2) and then retrogressive cooling (M3) following peak metamorphism (M1). The decompression textures are represented by worm-like hypersthene + plagioclase symplectites or clinopyroxene + orthopyroxene + plagioclase coronas in mafic granulites, hornblende/cummingtonite + plagioclase symplectites in amphibolites, and cordierite coronas and cordierite + orthopyroxene or cordierite + spinel symplectites in pelitic rocks.

        "Absrtact": "A crucial step in processing speech audio data for information extraction, topic detection, or browsing/playback is to segment the input into sentence and topic units. Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with, or better than, word-based statistical language models-for both true and automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no hand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a significant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination of prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic models capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the literature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause and pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas pause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.",

        "Absrtact": "Within the past few decades, major losses of seagrass habitats in coastal waters impacted by cultural eutrophication have been documented worldwide. In confronting a pressing need to improve the management and protection of seagrass meadows, surprisingly little is known about the basic nutritional physiology of these critical habitat species, or the physiological mechanisms that control their responses to N and P gradients. The limited available evidence to date already has revealed, for some seagrass species such as the north temperate dominant Zostera marina, unusual responses to nutrient enrichment in comparison to other vascular plants. Seagrasses derive N and P from sediment pore water (especially ammonium) and the water column (most nitrate). The importance of leaves versus roots in nutrient acquisition depends, in part, on the enrichment conditions. For example, a shift from reliance on sediment pore water to increased reliance on the overlying water for N and P supplies has been observed under progressive water-column nutrient enrichment. Seagrasses may be N-limited in nutrient-poor waters with sandy or (less so) organic sediments, and P-limited in carbonate sediments. On the basis of data from few species, seagrasses appear to have active uptake systems for NO3 -and PO4 -3, but NH4 + uptake may involve both low- and high-affinity systems. P(i) uptake affinities reported thus far are much lower than values for active ammonium uptake, but comparable to values for nitrate uptake by leaf tissues. Beyond such basic information, seagrass species have shown considerable variation in nutritional response. Dominance of acropetal versus basipetal nutrient translocation appears to vary among species as an innate trait. While some species follow classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics for N(i) uptake, others have exhibited sustained linear uptake with limited or negligible product feedback inhibition, perhaps in adaptation to oligotrophic environments. Zostera marina also is able to maintain nitrate reductase (NR) activity during dark periods if adequate carbohydrate reserves and substrate are available. Thus, this species can respond to nitrate pulses throughout a diel cycle, rather than being limited as most plants to nitrate uptake during the light period. Further adaptations may have occurred for seagrasses in extremely nitrate-depauperate conditions. For example, Halophila decipiens and H. stipulacea lack inducible NR and apparently have lost the ability to reduce nitrate; and a biphasic rather than hyperbolic P(i) uptake curve, with 'surge' uptake, has been described for Zostera noltii. Many seagrasses respond favorably to low or moderate N and/or P enrichment. However, excessive N(i) loading to the water column can inhibit seagrass growth and survival, not only as an indirect effect by stimulating algal overgrowth and associated light reduction, but - for some species - as a direct physiological effect. The latter direct impact has been most pronounced for plants growing in sandy (nutrient-poor) sediments, and is exacerbated by elevated temperatures and/or light reduction. Ammonia toxicity, known for many vascular plants, has been reported in seagrasses Ruppia drepanensis and Z. marina (125 \u03bcM water-column NH4 +, 5 weeks). Z. marina has shown to be inhibited, as well, by pulsed water-column nitrate enrichment (as low as 3.5-7 \u03bcM NO3 -, 3-5 weeks), which is actively taken up without apparent product feedback inhibition. Inhibition by elevated nitrate has also been reported, with description of the underlying physiological mechanisms, in certain macroalgae and microalgae. In Z. marina, this effect has been related to the high, sustained energy demands of nitrate uptake, and to inducement of internal carbon limitation by the concomitant 'carbon drain' into amino acid assimilation. In contrast, nitrate enrichment can stimulate growth of Z. marina when the sediment, rather than the water column, is the source. Because seagrass species have shown considerable variation in nutritional response, inferences about one well-studied species, from one geographic location, should not be applied a priori to that species in other regions or to seagrasses in general. Most of the available information has been obtained from study of a few species, and the basic nutritional physiology of many seagrasses remains to be examined and compared across geographic regions. Nonetheless, the relatively recent gains in general understanding about the physiological responses of some seagrass species to nutrient gradients already have proven valuable in both basic and applied research. For example, physiological variables such as tissue C:N:P content have begun to be developed as integrative indicators of nutrient conditions and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. To strengthen insights for management strategies to optimize seagrass survival in coastal waters adjacent to exponential human population growth and associated nutrient inputs, additional emphasis is critically needed to assess the role of variable interactions - among inorganic as well as organic N, P and C, environmental factors such as temperature, light, and other community components - in controlling the physiology, growth and survival of these ecologically important marine angiosperms.

The chronostratigraphy of the cores is based on planktonic \u03b418O records, 14C AMS-dating, and the recognition of Heinrich Events H1 through H4. Increased abundances of suspension feeding benthic foraminifers, denoted as 'Epibenthos Group', closely match areas where the recent MOW core layers impinge on the continental slope at 800 and 1300 m water depth, and near-bottom current velocities are enhanced. Elevated 'Epibenthos Group' abundances, increased benthic \u03b413C, and sedimentological evidence for winnowing and erosion are found in glacial sections up to the earliest Termination I in cores at water depths between 1600 and 2200 m off southern Portugal. The combined evidence reveals enhanced current activity at these depths due to a deep glacial MOW. The MOW advection at the Portuguese margin during the last Glacial was about 700 m deeper than today, conceivably forced by increased MOW density due to higher salinity and colder temperatures of Mediterranean waters. The deep MOW current gradually decreased in strength and shoaled to 1300 m water depth during the Termination and early Holocene. A shallow MOW core layer became active with the onset of Termination I at depths between 600 and 1000 m. Both the shallow and deep MOW current culminated during the Younger Dryas period. The present flow pattern with two MOW core layers centred at 800 and 1300 m water depth was established between 7.5 and 5.5 ka. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Since the mid-1980s a previously undescribed disease has affected moose in south-western Sweden. Investigations made to reveal evidence of a viral aetiology have proved unsuccessful. Trace element studies in apparently healthy moose shot during regular hunting suggested a trace element imbalance, with excessive molybdenum uptake causing secondary copper deficiency. The results also indicated a possible chromium deficiency. To verify this hypothesis, an experimental study was performed in male goats fed a semi-synthetic diet for 1.5 years. The animals were kept and treated in four groups: Controls, Cu-deficient group (group 1), Cr-deficient group (group 2), and combined Cu- and Cr-deficient group with additional supplementation of tetrathiomolybdate for 10 weeks at the end of the study (group 3). The present paper presents tissue contents of trace and minor elements, haematology and clinical chemical parameters. Feed consumption and weight development, as well as pathological and histopathological investigations, were also performed in this study, but these results are presented elsewhere. Changes in trace element concentrations were determined by comparing groups 1, 2 and 3 with the control group. Increased concentrations were observed for Al, Ca, Co, Fe, Mo, Pb, Se in the liver; for Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Mo in the kidneys; and for Mn and Mo in the ribs. Considerable accumulation of Mn in ribs seems to be a useful way to determine oxidative stress. Decreases in Mg and P in all organs and blood serum is characteristic of Cu deficiency and molybdenosis. Also the ratio of Ca/Mg was increased as the result of tissue lesions causing an intracellular increase in Ca and decrease in Mg. The trace element changes observed in group 1 were enhanced by the Mo supplementation in group 3, resulting in characteristic patterns, 'spectra' of changes. The alterations were not as remarkable in group 2 as in the two other groups. However, Cr deficiency considerably influenced Al, Co, V and to a smaller extent also Mn in ribs. In groups 1 and 2, only a few minor changes were detected in the haematological parameters, probably caused by increased adrenal activity after transportation of the animals. In group 3, severe anaemia was present but also a leukopenia. For the different clinical chemical parameters measured, all three groups showed changes, explained mainly by the altered activity of enzymes induced by trace element deficiencies and imbalance. Impaired carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was seen in groups 1 and 3, with increased concentrations of glucose, lactate and triglycerides in serum. Increased concentrations of total bilirubin were measured in all three groups (bile stasis was also seen post mortem). A considerably increased concentration of serum urea was found in group 3, although there were no indications of renal insufficiency or dehydration. Regarding hormones, a substantial decrease was seen in thyroxine (T4) in group 3 as a result of the molybdenosis, but a minor decrease was also seen in group 1. Insulin on the other hand showed increased levels in group 3 - and especially in group 2 due to the Cr deficiency but also affected by the molybdenosis. As could be expected, Cu deficiency (groups 1 and 3) caused low levels of caeruloplasmin, secondarily affecting the Fe metabolism in these animals. Protein abnormalities, detected as altered electrophoretic patterns of serum proteins, were also seen mainly in group 3. The findings were also confirmed by multivariate data analysis, where PCA revealed the overall impact of the deficiencies, and PLS regression coefficients indicated the influence on the various analytes.

Textural relationships support the hypothesis of garnet formation by peritectic reactions involving high-jadeite clinopyroxene, while inclusions entrapped in garnet, mainly a wide range of amphibole compositions, seemingly crystallised from a fluid phase in disequilibrium with the garnet host. Thermobarometric estimates indicate UHP, HT peak conditions (2.8-3.2 GPa, 780-840\u00b0C) inconsistent with those of the associated rocks, followed by a complicated exhumation path. The P-T-array of the retrograde path suggests syn-subduction exhumation and tectonic inclusion in a melange with a matrix derived from the accretionary wedge. Partial melting of the subducting slab, which induces tectonic weakening, may be an effective mechanism in detaching and enclosing small eclogite pods in metamorphic terrains.

        "Absrtact": "The objective of this paper is to determine spectral bands that are best suited for characterizing agricultural crop biophysical variables. The data for this study comes from ground-level hyperspectral reflectance measurements of cotton, potato, soybeans, corn, and sunflower. Reflectance was measured in 490 discrete narrow bands between 350 and 1,050 nm. Observed crop characteristics included wet biomass, leaf area index, plant height, and (for cotton only) yield. Three types of hyperspectral predictors were tested: optimum multiple narrow band reflectance (OMNBR), narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) involving all possible two-band combinations of 490 channels, and the soil-adjusted vegetation indices. A critical problem with OMNBR models was that of 'over fitting' (i.e., using more spectral channels than experimental samples to obtain a highly maximum R2 value). This problem was addressed by comparing the R2 values of crop variables with the R2 values computed for random data of a large sample size. The combinations of two to four narrow bands in OMNBR models explained most (64% to 92%) of the variability in crop biophysicaI variables. The second part of the paper describes a rigorous search procedure to identify the best narrow band NDVI predictors of crop biophysical variables. Special narrow band lambda (\u03bb1) versus lambda (\u03bb2) plots of R2 values illustrate the most effective wavelength combinations (\u03bb1 and \u03bb2) and band-widths (\u0394\u03bb1 and \u0394\u03bb2) for predicting the biophysical quantities of each crop. The best of these two-band indices were further tested to see if soil adjustment or nonlinear fitting could improve their predictive accuracy. The best of the narrow band NDVI models explained 64% to 88% variability in different crop biophysical variables. A strong relationship with crop characteristics is located in specific narrow bands in the longer wavelength portion of the red (650 nm to 700 nm), with secondary clusters in the shorter wavelength portion of green (500 nm to 550 nm), in one particular section of the near-infrared (900 mn to 940 nm), and in the moisture sensitive near-infrared (centered at 982 nm). This study recommends a 12 narrow band sensor, in the 350 nm to 1,050 nm range of the spectrum, for optimum estimation of agricultural crop biophysical information.

        "Absrtact": "Similar to many domains in the psychopathology literature, overlap and covariation between antisocial behavior (ASB) and alcohol dependence (AD) are oft documented but little understood. Although the relation between ASB and AD is reliably found and of substantial magnitude, it is not possible given the extant research to discriminate among alternative causal models that could give rise to this relation (e.g., ASB\u2192AD, AD\u2192ASB, reciprocal causation between ASB and AD, common causes of ASB and AD). In our opinion, true comorbidity among disorders can only be demonstrated and understood in the context of considerable knowledge regarding the disorders' underlying causes (viz., pathology and etiology). In this article, we present a number of behavior genetic models that may be useful for illuminating the causes of comorbidity among two or more disorders, as well as for understanding the etiology of each disorder individually. Using these behavior genetic approaches, psychopathology researchers can directly test alternative models for the comorbidity among disorders, as well as estimate the magnitude of different etiological factors (i.e., genetic and environmental influences) on comorbidity. Although not a panacea and somewhat demanding technically, behavior genetic approaches can shed new light on the comorbidity among disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Carbon and strontium isotope studies of numerous drillcore and outcrop sections within individual Australian Neoproterozoic basins, in a tectonic and sedimentologic framework, have allowed the construction of isotopic records for the interval 830-750 Ma. This, combined with the discovery of a restricted stratigraphic range for the acritarch Cerebrosphaera buickii in mid-Neoproterozoic strata of Australia, makes possible correlation with successions in Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen. That part of the mid-Neoproterozoic succession in Spitsbergen which contains C. buickii was previously considered younger than the Sturtian glacial epoch, but this study has indicated that the Akademikerbreen Group is older than that. A correlation scheme is proposed along five tie lines, and is based on a correlation between Australia and Canada at ~830 Ma, and Australia, Spitsbergen and Namibia at ~760 Ma. The lowest ever recorded seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the upper Shaler Supergroup of Canada (0.70561-0.70670) compare with ratios in evaporites of the ~830 Ma Bitter Springs Formation, Amadeus Basin, Australia (0.70568-0.70720). Comparable \u03b413C(carb) records support a correlation. At about 760 Ma, a correlation is made between the heaviest mid-Neoproterozoic \u03b413C(carb) values of 7.2\u2030 (upper Burra Group, Adelaide Rift Complex) and 8.1\u2030 (Kanpa Formation, western Officer Basin) in Australia, 8.5\u2030 in Spitsbergen (Backlundtoppen Formation, Akademikerbreen Group), and 8.5\u2030 in Namibia (Ombombo Subgroup, Congo Craton). The stratigraphic range of C. buickii in Australia and Spitsbergen supports this correlation. A compilation of \u03b413C(carb) and 87Sr/86Sr records between about 830 and 750 Ma from Australia, Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen reveals numerous negative excursions, which are not associated with preserved glacial deposits. It is necessary, therefore, to consider additional models to the 'Snowball Earth' to explain the large and rapid carbon isotopic excursions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "This paper formally incorporates parameter uncertainty and model error into the implementation of contingent claim models. We make hypotheses for the distribution of errors to allow the use of likelihood based estimators consistent with parameter uncertainty and model error. We then write a Bayesian estimator which does not rely on large sample properties but allows exact inference on the relevant functions of the parameters (option value, hedge ratios) and forecasts. This is crucial because the common practice of frequently updating the model parameters leads to small samples. Even for simple error structures and the Black-Scholes model, the Bayesian estimator does not have an analytical solution. Markov chain Monte Carlo estimators help solve this problem. We show how they extend to some generalizations of the error structure. We apply these estimators to the Black-Scholes. Given recent work using non-parametric function to price options, we nest the B-S in a polynomial expansion of its inputs. Despite improved in-sample fit, the expansions do not yield any out-of-sample improvement over the B-S. Also, the out-of-sample errors, though larger than in-sample, are of the same magnitude. This contrasts with the performance of the popular implied tree methods which produce outstanding in-sample but disastrous out-of-sample fit as Dumas, Fleming and Whaley (1997) show. This means that the estimation method is as crucial as the model itself. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

Integration of deposit geology, 40Ar-39Ar geochronology and stable isotope studies with regional geological mapping and U-Pb zircon dating, has led to the resolution of three principal metallogenic epochs. Ordovician intrusion-hosted Ni-Cu sulfide deposits and rare-metal-enriched pegmatites were succeeded by a province-wide metallogenic epoch and concurrent tectonic processes during the Devonian. This epoch was characterized by mesothermal lode Au deposits, high-level Ag-Pb-Zn veins, W \u00b1 Cu-bearing veins and replacements, and various pegmatite- and granite-related lithophile element deposits. Finally, Miocene-Pliocene epithermal Au-Ag mineralization developed during Andean tectonic events. Sericitic alteration associated with mesothermal lode Au (\u00b1 Cu \u00b1 Ag) in the Sierra de Las Minas and Sierras de Cordoba yields Devonian 40Ar-39Ar step heating ages in the ranges 382-393 and 351-378 Ma, respectively. These ages span the timing of Ag-Pb-Zn sulfide-quartz veining in the El Guaico district (386 \u00b1 4 Ma, sericite), and W-bearing quartz vein mineralization in the Aguas de Ram\u00f3n and El Morro districts which yielded muscovite ages of 366 \u00b1 1 and 363 \u00b1 1 Ma, respectively. Oxygen isotope \u03b418OSMOW compositions of the Au, Ag-Pb-Zn and W ore-forming fluids, calculated from quartz, white mica and chlorite isotope ratios, range from 5.2\u2030 to 10.8\u2030 (n = 32), whereas calculated \u03b4DSMOW compositions range from -61\u2030 in the La Rioja Au systems to -141\u2030 in the W veins (n = 9). Sulfide \u03b434S values range from 1.5\u2030 to 10.0\u2030, averaging 6.5\u2030 (n = 15). The oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope data suggest contributions to the ore fluids of either D-depleted meteoric waters that have reacted extensively with metasedimentary rocks, or fluids equilibrated with degassed felsic magmas, or mixtures of both. This mineralization formed during and up to 20-30 Ma after widespread emplacement of high-level peraluminous to metaluminous granites, which yielded U-Pb zircon ages of 404 \u00b1 6-382 \u00b1 6 Ma. The Devonian Au deposits are localised in transcurrent and reverse fault and shear zones that may be related to collision of the Chilenia terrane with the western margin of Gondwana during the newly defined Achalian orogeny. These deposits are considered to be members of the mesothermal lode Au family of systems found worldwide. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

We distinguish 18 features (Z-I) in the \u03b413C(carbonate) and \u03b413C(organic) curves: two intervals of well-defined variation in 87Sr/86Sr; and two peaks in the variation of \u03b434S(sulfate). Newly acquired isotopic data in Australia enable correlation with Canada: the Gillen Member of the Bitter Springs Formation, estimated to be about 840 Ma, is correlated with the upper Shaler Supergroup; the Sturtian glacials, about 700 Ma, with the Rapitan glacials; and the Marinoan glacials, about 600 Ma, with the Ice Brook glacials. We recognize only these two major glaciations, and possibly a third minor glaciation, at 570 Ma. Columns in Poland, Namibia, Iran, and Siberia, and possibly Oman and Mongolia provide correlation by \u03b413C, and in Svalbard, Siberia, Oman, and Mali by 87Sr/86Sr. The inter-glacial (700-600 Ma) peak of \u03b434S(sulfide) enables correlation among Australia, Namibia, and China. Two icehouse states were preceded by massive sequestering of CO2 and accompanied by catastrophic declines in biological productivity. During and immediately after the older, Sturtian, glaciation, the deeper parts of the ocean were anoxic and contained sufficient ferrous iron to sequester very large amounts of sulfur derived from bacterial reduction of sulfate; the evidence suggests that the resultant huge shift in the sulfur isotropic composition was global and accompanied by the reduction of as much as half the sulfate in the anoxic parts of the oceans. The effects of the Pan-African orogeny include mountain building and a high rate of sedimentation, which resulted in the burial of large amounts of organic matter and concomitant oxygenation of the hydrosphere and atmosphere. This reinforced a trend in oxygenation that began before the second, Marinoan, glaciation. A second huge sulfur isotope anomaly accompanies the tectonism, and has been explained previously as possibly resulting from the desiccation and flushing of evolving ocean basins. This may be linked to a remarkable carbon isotope anomaly immediately preceding the Cambrian: the anomaly could be due to release of methane from oceanic clathrates de-stabilized by combined sea level fall and global warming resulting from volcanic release of CO2.

The Teno massif (NW) was erupted in a short time period around 6.0-6.4 Ma, while at least the lower half of the Roque del Conde massif (SW) is older than 11 Ma. In contrast, the Anaga massif (NE) is polygenetic, with 39Ar-40Ar ages ranging from 8.0-4.2 Ma, and no simple stratigraphic chemical progression. These ages run counter to published suggestions of progressive younging of Canary shield stages to the southwest. Basic rocks in all three massifs are the result of much deeper melting and smaller melt fractions than equivalent units in Gran Canaria, but nevertheless the melting column must have extended significantly into the spinel facies, requiring substantial disruption of the local lithosphere. The age and melting relationships broadly support the mantle blob model for Canary magmatism proposed by Hoernle and Schmincke (Hoernle, K., Schminke, H.-U., 1993. The role of partial melting in the 15-Ma geochemical evolution of Gran Canaria: a blob model for the Canary hotspot. J. Petrol. 34, 599-626). In all three massifs, extensive fractional crystallisation has taken place at crustal levels so that mean MgO contents are only some 6-7%. The fractionation sequence is olivine-clinopyroxene-magnetite in basaltic compositions, with the involvement of plagioclase, amphibole and apatite only to generate the infrequent more evolved hawaiites to benmoreites. Despite the abundance of basanitic magmas in the Tenerife older massifs, these follow a differentiation trend towards weakly undersaturated benmoreite rather than to phonolite. This probably reflects early crystallisation of magnetite, perhaps resulting from somewhat high oxygen fugacity. The chemical evidence for replenished magma chambers in Tenerife described by Neumann et al. (Neumann, E.R., Wulff-Oedersen, E., Simonsen, S.L., Pearson, N.J., Mart\u00ed, J., Mitjavila, J., 1999. Evidence for fractional crystallisation of periodically refilled magma chambers in Tenerife, Canary Islands. J. Petrol. 40, 1089-1123) is a consequence of treating as a single cogenetic suite the products of several magmatic systems that differ in parental melt fraction. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

Data sets for this purpose contain data from spatially extensive networks of sites. The data are either directly comparable to model output or readily interpretable in terms of modelled climate variables. Data sets must contain sufficient documentation to distinguish between raw (primary) and interpreted (secondary, tertiary) data, to evaluate the assumptions involved in interpretation of the data, to exercise quality control, and to select data appropriate for specific goals. Four data bases for the Late Quaternary, documenting changes in lake levels since 30 14C kyr BP (the Global Lake Status Data Base), vegetation distribution at 18 14C kyr and 6 14C kyr BP (BIOME 6000), aeolian accumulation rates during the last glacial-interglacial cycle (DIRTMAP), and tropical terrestrial climates at the Last Glacial Maximum (the LGM Tropical Terrestrial Data Synthesis) are summarised. Each has been used to evaluate simulations of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21 calendar kyr BP) and/or mid-Holocene (6 cal. kyr BP) environments. Comparisons have demonstrated that changes in radiative forcing and orography due to orbital and ice-sheet variations explain the first-order, broad-scale (in space and time) features of global climate change since the LGM. However, atmospheric models forced by 6 cal. kyr BP orbital changes with unchanged surface conditions fail to capture quantitative aspects of the observed climate, including the greatly increased magnitude and northward shift of the African monsoon during the early to mid-Holocene. Similarly, comparisons with palaeoenvironmental datasets show that atmospheric models have underestimated the magnitude of cooling and drying of much of the land surface at the LGM The inclusion of feedbacks due to changes in ocean- and land-surface conditions at both times, and atmospheric dust loading at the LGM, appears to be required in order to produce a better simulation of these past climates. The development of Earth system models incorporating the dynamic interactions among ocean, atmosphere, and vegetation is therefore mandated by Quaternary science results as well as climatological principles. For greatest scientific benefit, this development must be paralleled by continued advances in palaeodata analysis and synthesis, which in turn will help to define questions that call for new focused data collection efforts.",

Model results are presented for two test periods, the whole of one winter for which daily observations are available, and a short subset for which hourly data were presented. The best results are those given by MACRO with an expert user, although satisfactory results were also obtained from CRACK-NP and for the longer test period by PLM. SIMULAT was less successful in modelling the site because it did not include an adequate representation of the site hydrology, it was unable to predict the leaching of pesticide. MACRO was also used by a second modelling group who were less familiar with both the code and the site. Although the initial uncalibrated runs from this group were poor, the final calibrated results were almost as good as those derived by the 'expert' user. The simulations showed the difficulty of deriving adequate representations, even where relatively complete soil physical data are available. A shortcoming of the dataset provided was the lack of detailed soil moisture observations, particularly to define the initial conditions. From a well-monitored site, many observations of site hydrology (water table position, drainflow and surface flow) were available, but significantly, fewer pesticide concentrations in either the soil or the discharges were available. Models could thus be evaluated only in terms of their ability to predict the magnitude and timing of major pesticide leaching events. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Together with the fact that most modelers calibrated at least part of their model, the possibility for evaluating model concepts was limited. In the case of bentazone, most model predictions were within the 95% confidence intervals of the observations. In the case of ethoprophos, model performance was often poor due to the ignorance of volatilization, kinetic sorption and adaptation of the microbial population.

Both mechanistic models, based on the solution of the governing flow equations (the Richards equation for soil water and the convection dispersion equation for solute flow) and functional, more empirical models were considered in the analysis. Simulations were carried out by 18 modellers allowing the characterisation of model performance in terms of user specific model parameterisation. Both uncalibrated and calibrated results are presented which demonstrate the impact of model calibrations on modelling results. In this paper, the ability of the models to correctly represent the physical transport processes is evaluated, while in a subsequent paper (Tiktak, 2000. Agric. Water Manage. Vol. 44, pp 119-134), the potential of the models to represent pesticide fate correctly will be assessed. Model calibration had a major impact on the simulation of water flow in soils. In general, after calibration, the Richards' type models were superior to the capacity type models. However, user-specific hydraulic parameter estimation procedures introduce considerable variability in model performance which sometimes overrules conceptual model differences (Richards'/capacity). The evaluation of the solute transport component of the models was inhibited by the lack of reliable tracer data. Heat transport modelling in the top soil was not felt as being a bottleneck in our modelling technology. A plea is made for developing good modelling practices in which guidelines for selecting robust parameter estimation methods are defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

This paper presents the methodology and major conclusions of a test of pesticide-leaching models. Twelve models simulating the vertical one-dimensional movement of water, solute, heat, and, in particular, pesticides, through the soil profile were used by 36 different modellers. The adopted modelling codes differ in terms of modelling concepts and modelling hypothesis. Modellers were affiliated to industry and to the scientific community as well. Four quality datasets were identified to perform the analysis. The dataset included field and lysimeter data, collected in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and the UK. As well, non-structured as structured soils were available in the dataset. To elucidate the ability to model correctly water transport, solute transport, heat transport and pesticide transport in soils, a stepwise evaluation approach was followed. Splitting up the experimental dataset enabled us to quantify the calibration capability and the prediction capability of the models. The simulations were performed by different model users enabling us also to characterise output variability in terms of user dependent interpretation of the model input and parameters. Recommendations are formulated for improving the quality of modelling datasets, and the process description of water, solute, and heat transport in a pesticide-leaching model, plus the process description of pesticide fate. Application of the principles of good modelling practice (GMP) is briefly described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Robust solutions can be obtained from Rayleigh wave spectra at as few as three stations, and from a combination of Rayleigh and Love waves at only two stations, provided they sample 60\u00b0in azimuth. The systematic application of this method to a dataset of 43 large earthquakes during 1996-1999 yielded mechanisms rotated an average of only 17\u00b0from the published Harvard CMT, a figure comparing favorably with the case of other catalogues, such as the USGS moment tensor solutions.

It is found that a quadratic in the sine of solar elevation fits the data very well at all locations. Other parameters include the mean monthly clearness index, Kt, the average day length, and the daily average solar elevation. Based on this dataset, a detailed performance assessment is conducted for these new models, as well as for six models of the literature. Their respective performance is discussed, particularly with respect to the latitudinal effect. The proposed models appear to correctly predict irradiations even for a very low sun typical of near-polar night conditions. The accurate predictions of the newly proposed 'daily integration model' translate into the lowest yearly-average and site-average Root Mean Square Difference, a statistic obtained by comparison with 21 722 measured hourly irradiations. However, it is stressed that the performance of this kind of model is seriously limited by artefacts due to shading (e.g., from mountains), and, more importantly, by strong morning/afternoon radiative asymmetries due to local or climatological influences, which cannot be predicted from just daily irradiation data. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Tor Mancina dataset is the result of a 3-year lysimeter experiment carried out near Rome (Italy) on a clay-loam calcareous fluvisol, which aimed to asses the risk of groundwater contamination from some herbicides commonly used in the Mediterranean area. Parameters available for modelling are water percolation, bromide leaching, and the occurrence of metolachlor residues in leachates. All parameters refer to two irrigation treatments to evaluate the effect of different water supplies (398 and 548 mm). The total amount of percolated water was equal to 660 mm as an average for both the treatments, with a total rainfall of 2432 mm. The average concentration of metolachlor in the leachate was 0.008 / 0.012 \u03bcg l-1, and maximum concentration 1.63 / 22.9 \u03bcg l-1. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In the boreal mixedwood, successional trajectories exhibit significant variability, thereby making classification systems based on age or seral stage difficult to apply. Furthermore, a lack of extensive datasets on forest structure prevents comprehensive, multivariate classification of stands. Alternatively, we designated old growth status using the proportion (\u226515%) of large trees (\u226540 cm DBH) and the subcanopy/canopy tree ratios (>1.5). With these riteria, approximately 11.4% of the boreal mixedwood landbase within northeastern Alberta has an old growth structure. Proportionally, more old growth structure was found in aspen and white spruce mixedwood types, with lesser proportions in pure aspen and white spruce stands. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the tree size criteria was the most important driving variable in determining the amount of old growth. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A model is proposed to estimate apex temperature from meteorological data, when the leaf area index is less than 0.5. This model is based on the energy balance of the apical meristem, considered as a vertical cylinder close to the soil surface, called 'apex'. Soil surface temperature was calculated from an energy and water balance of the soil. Input data were hourly standard meteorological data and soil texture. Stomatal conductance was calculated from solar radiation and water vapor deficit. Five field experiments with different soil and climatic conditions were conducted to calibrate and validate the model. The roughness length of the soil surface was used as a calibrating factor. The selected value was 0.3 mm, and was used on all datasets. The agreement between observed and calculated apex temperatures was fairly good, with residual standard deviations between 0.8 and 1.9 K in five experiments, while apex temperature was generally higher than air temperature at screen level by more than 5-7 K during the day. This study showed that the main problem to overcome in estimating apex temperature, is to calculate air temperature at apex height, i.e. at several centimeters from the soil surface. This requires development of precise soil surface temperature models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

This paper presents an algorithm that considerably reduces the number of triangles generated by a Marching Cubes algorithm, while presenting very close or shorter running times. The algorithm first assumes discretization of the dataset space and replaces cell edge interpolation by midpoint selection. Under these assumptions the extracted surfaces are composed of polygons lying within a finite number of incidences, thus allowing simple merging of the output facets into large coplanar triangular facets. Lastly, the vertices which survived the decimation process are located on their exact positions and normals are computed. An experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on datasets relevant to biomedical imaging and chemical modeling is reported.",

However, the majority of this work has been attempted without reference to the needs of ecological process studies. While model initialisation is an important task there are other ways in which remote sensing can be combined with ecological models. This paper identifies four alternative strategies: (i) to use remotely sensed data to provide estimates of variables required to drive ecological process models, (ii) to use remotely sensed data to test, validate or verify predictions of ecological process modes, (iii) to use remotely sensed data to update or adjust ecological process model predictions and (iv) to use ecological process models to understand remotely sensed data. The objectives of the paper are to review the four strategies by reference to examples. Directions for future work are identified for each strategy, which can be grouped in terms of estimation accuracy, issues of spatial and temporal scale, long term comprehensive datasets and development of new methods and models with the emphasis on increased interaction between scientists from the remote sensing and ecological modelling disciplines.

        "Absrtact": "Neoproterozoic (Sinian) sediments are exceptionally well preserved in the Three Gorges region (western Hubei Province) of the South China block. We report new paleomagnetic results, obtained independently by two separate laboratories, from a total of 157 samples of the 748 \u00b1 12 Ma, basal Sinian Liantuo Formation at its type locality. Detailed thermal demagnetization procedures and least-squares line analyses reveal three distinct magnetic components among the suite of samples. Two overprint components can be distinguished from each other by their laboratory unblocking temperatures. The first to be removed ('C'), always annihilated below 600\u00b0C, is common throughout the dataset but is amenable to least-squares line-fitting in only 37 samples. It yields a pole which in present coordinates resembles Mesozoic overprints identified from previous studies in the Three Gorges region (75.7\u00b0N, 174.3\u00b0E, d(p) = 6.0\u00b0, d(m) = 8.3\u00b0, Q = 4). The higher unblocking-temperature overprint ('B'), always subsidiary to the 'A' component, is more prevalent than 'C' and was identified by line-fitting in 67 samples. The 'B' direction is very steep and generates a paleopole whose in situ coordinates do not resemble the Mesozoic-Cenozoic apparent polar wander path for South China, and whose tilt-corrected coordinates (20.3\u00b0N, 106.2\u00b0E, d(p) = 7.2\u00b0, d(m) = 7.3\u00b0, Q = 5) bear no resemblance to any reliable Phanerozoic paleopoles from the South China block. The steep 'B' direction, if an unbiased representative of an ancient geomagnetic dipole field, was probably acquired some time in the 200 m.y. interval between deposition of the Liantuo Formation at ~750 Ma and Cambrian time. The most stable component is a two-polarity remanence, removed at temperatures predominantly >630\u00b0C, which we infer to reside in hematite. A change in polarity of this component occupies a similar stratigraphic position (within 5 cm) among three outcrops separated by ~100 m lateral distance. We calculate a mean paleomagnetic pole from each of the laboratories' datasets and combine these with a previously determined pole from correlative rocks in Yunnan ['N1' of Zhang and Piper, Precambrian Res. 85 (1997) 173-199], to obtain an overall weighted mean paleomagnetic pole (04.4\u00b0N, 161.1\u00b0E, A95 = 12.9\u00b0, Q = 7) for the South China block at 748 \u00b1 12 Ma. The combined 'Z1' pole is considered to be primary based on its thermal stability, its magnetostratigraphic consistency, and a soft-sediment fold test determined by previous work. Results from individual sampling areas constrain the depositional paleolatitude of the Liantuo Formation and equivalent Sinian rocks to 30-40\u00b0. This result applies to one or both of the stratigraphically adjacent Chang'an and Nantuo glacial deposits; unfortunately, it is neither high nor low enough to refute any of the conceptual models for the enigmatic Neoproterozoic glaciations. The new basal Sinian paleopole, in the context of recent paleomagnetic and geochronological results from Australia, suggests that the Nantuo glaciation is pre-Marinoan. The new 'Z1' pole may also provide constraints on the various proposed reconstructions of South China's position in Rodinia. In particular, a paleoposition adjacent to northwestern Australia at ~750 Ma requires a specific relative orientation between the two blocks. Likewise, if Rodinia were still intact by 750 Ma, South China may have lain between Australia and Laurentia only in an orientation different from that originally proposed in the 'missing link' hypothesis. As a final alternative, the new paleomagnetic data could be used to position South China, Australia, and Laurentia in an immediately post-Rodinian paleogeography around the nascent Pacific Ocean.

We examined the effectiveness of using Vascular plant diversity as a basis for choosing reserves to capture bryophyte and lichen diversity. We surveyed 35, 20x50 m sites for bryophytes, lichens and vascular plants in a forest management district of eastern Australia. Despite being based on a relatively few sites, these results are informative because data-sets in which all three taxa are identified to species level are uncommon. We found that a set of sites that reserved 90% of vascular plant species captured 65% of bryophyte species and 87% of lichen species. Also, the sites that were 'irreplaceable' for overstorey species in a minimum reserve set captured 88 and 89% of bryophyte and lichen species, respectively. Vascular plant communities defined using clustering predicted highly significant variation in both bryophyte and lichen species composition. However, both vascular plant species richness and genus richness were poor predictors of bryophyte and lichen species diversity. The results indicate that, on a local scale, reserves selected for vascular plants can capture large percentages of bryophytes and lichens, however individual sites important for bryophyte and lichen conservation may not be important for vascular plant conservation.

A key element to this objective is the improvement of current fire detection systems. As in many applications, it is desired to increase detection sensitivity and, more importantly, increase the reliability of the detection system through improved nuisance alarm immunity. Improved reliability is needed such that fire detection systems can automatically control fire suppression systems. The use of multi-criteria-based detection technology continues to offer the most promising means to achieve both improved sensitivity to real fires and reduced susceptibility to nuisance alarm sources. A multi-signature early warning fire detection system is being developed to provide reliable warning of actual fire conditions in less time with fewer nuisance alarms than can be achieved with commercially available smoke detection systems. In this study, a large database consisting of the responses of 20 sensors to several different types of fires and nuisance sources was generated and analyzed using a variety of multivariate methods. Three data matrices were developed at discrete times corresponding to the different alarm levels of a conventional photoelectric smoke detector. The alarm times represent 0.82%, 1.63% and 11% obscurations per meter. The datasets were organized into three classes representing the sensor responses for baseline (nonfire), fires and nuisance sources. A robust data analysis strategy for use with a sensor array consisting of four to five sensors for early fire detection and nuisance source rejection was developed using a probabilistic neural network (PNN) that was developed at the Naval Research Laboratory for chemical sensor arrays. The analysis algorithms described in this paper evaluate discrete samples and develop classification models that examine individual chemical signatures at discrete points.",

        "Absrtact": "A coupled vegetation growth and soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model is used in conjunction with data collected in the course of the SALSA program during the 1997-1999 growing seasons in Mexico. The objective is to provide insights on the interactions between grassland dynamics and water and energy budgets. These three years exhibit drastically different precipitation regimes and thus different vegetation growth. The result of the coupled model showed that for the 3 years, the observed seasonal variation of plant biomass, leaf area index (LAI) are well reproduced by the model. It is also shown that the model simulations of soil moisture, radiative surface temperature and surface fluxes compared fairly well with the observations. Reflectance data in the red, near infrared, and short wave infrared (SWIR, 1600 nm) bands measured by the VEGETATION sensor onboard SPOT-4 were corrected from atmospheric and directional effects and compared to the observed biomass and LAI during the 1998-1999 seasons. The results of this 'ground to satellite' approach established that the biomass and LAI are linearly related to the satellite reflectances (RED and SWIR), and to vegetation indices (NDVI and SWVI, which is a SWlR-based NDVI). The SWIR and SWVI sensitivity to the amount of plant tissues were similar to the classical RED and NDVI sensitivity, for LAI ranging from 0 and 0.8 m2 m-2 and biomass ranging from 0 to 120 g DM m-2. Finally, LAI values simulated by the vegetation model were fed into a canopy radiative transfer scheme (a 'model to satellite' approach). Using two leaf optical properties datasets, the computed RED, NIR and SWlR reflectances and vegetation indices (NDVI and SWVI) compared reasonably well with the VEGETATION observations in 1998 and 1999, except for the NIR band and during the senescence period, when the leaf optical properties present a larger uncertainty. We conclude that a physically-sound linkage between the vegetation model and the satellite can be used for red to short wave infrared domain over these grasslands. These different results represent an important step toward using new generation satellite data to control and validate model's simulations at regional scale.

        "Absrtact": "The present work is concerned with the development of methodological procedures for studying the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the marine environment. Seven ecological indices (S, number of phytoplankton species; N, total number of individuals; DMg, Margalef\u2019s index; DMn, Menhinick's index; DOd, Odum\u2019s species per thousand individuals; H\u2019, Shannon\u2019s Diversity index; E, Evenness index), based on phytoplankton community data collected from Saronicos Gulf, Greece were used for describing the eutrophication state of the sea environment. A representation of the spatial distribution for each ecological index was developed using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. A eutrophication scale for each index was also developed for indicating four different trophic levels in the marine environment (eutrophic, upper-mesotrophic, lower-mesotrophic, oligotrophic); categorization of the interpolated values of each index resulted in a clear illustration of these trophic levels on seven thematic maps. Two methodological procedures were finally applied for synthesizing the information of these thematic maps. The purpose was the development of a final map illustrating the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the study area. The first procedure was based on the integration of unsupervised and supervised classification methods, widely used in the field of remote sensing, while the second one on the overlay technique, simply carried out within the frame of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The hybrid unsupervised/supervised classification method can assess the optimal number of classes in which data values from simultaneously considered parameters could be allocated, while the overlay technique is an additive procedure not taking into account existing trends in the dataset. The advantages and disadvantages of each procedure are further discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The anthropogenic increase in radiatively active gases in the atmosphere has been well documented, and there is evidence that suggests an impact of this increase on the earth's climate. Agriculture is vulnerable to climatic changes, and estimating the likely response to such changes is critical. The current work examines the impact of climate change on water stress during the critical periods of soybean [Glycine max (L.) merr.] reproductive development. This is a time of particular interest because soybeans at these stages are believed to be particularly vulnerable to water stress. Climate scenarios from three General Circulation Models (GCMs) were adapted to produce daily, simulated weather datasets for the nine climate centroids (in the state of Iowa). The GCMs were the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) models. Soil association datasets were created for two counties within each of the centroids. Simulations were performed for each county and each GCM at climate samples corresponding to climate change at 350,450,550, and 650 ppm atmospheric [CO2], using the mechanistic soybean physiology model GLYCIM. The model provided data on the probability and magnitude of water stress during the reproductive development stages of soybean crops. The results indicated that water stress was most severe during the R2-R5 stages under the UKMO scenarios, and became progressively more severe as climate change progressed. Although stress occurred under the GISS and GFDL scenarios, it did not increase with changing climate. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The problem of missing data is common in all fields of science. Various methods of estimating missing values in a dataset exist, such as deletion of cases, insertion of sample mean, and linear regression. Each approach presents problems inherent in the method itself or in the nature of the pattern of missing data. We report a method that (1) is more general in application and (2) provides better estimates than traditional approaches, such as one-step regression. The model is general in that it may be applied to singular matrices, such as small datasets or those that contain dummy or index variables. The strength of the model is that it builds a regression equation iteratively, using a bootstrap method. The precision of the regressed estimates of a variable increases as regressed estimates of the predictor variables improve. We illustrate this method with a set of measurements of European Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic human postcranial remains, as well as a set of primate anthropometric data. First, simulation tests using the primate data set involved randomly turning 20% of the values to 'missing'. In each case, the first iteration produced significantly better estimates than other estimating techniques. Second, we applied our method to the incomplete set of human postcranial measurements. MISDAT estimates always perform form better than replacement of missing data by means and better than classical multiple regression. As with classical multiple regression, MISDAT performs when squared multiple correlation values approach the reliability of the measurement to be estimated, e.g., above about 0\u00b78.",

        "Absrtact": "Calculation of an 40Ar/39Ar age involves several sources of systematic (external) and statistic (mostly instrumental) errors that should be propagated into the final result for a proper statistical assessment of the age uncertainty and the overall resolution of the 40Ar/39Ar dating technique. Error propagation is usually carried out by linearized error expansion techniques that weight the relative variance contribution of each input parameter by the squared partial derivative of the age function relative to this variable. Computation of partial derivatives through the working 40Ar/39Ar equations is tedious and error-prone, however. As a result, several data reduction schemes using different levels of approximation are implemented in various laboratories, some of which ignore certain sources of error while others use simplified error equations, thus making direct comparison of published age and error estimates sometimes inaccurate. Based on the general numerical approach outlined by Roddick (1987) [Roddick, J.C., 1987. Generalized numerical error analysis with applications to geochronology and thermodynamics. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 51, 2129-2135], a complete 40Ar/39Ar numerical error analysis (NEA) is proposed that includes up to 28 possible sources of error. The NEA code of Roddick (1987) is recast into a more rigorous central finite-difference (CFD) scheme, and applied to three non-ideal, worked 40Ar/39Ar examples to test underpinning assumptions of the linearized error propagation by extending the error analysis to higher-order terms of the Taylor expansion of the age equation. Close to very close agreement between the analytic and numerical solutions suggests that the linearized error expansion technique is justified for 40Ar/39Ar error propagation, despite strong nonlinearity in the related equations. In one pathological instance, nonlinearity is flagged by significant (15%) departure from the algebraic solution. The linearized age error estimate is still found to be acceptably close to the (exact) NEA estimate, provided however that covariance between 40Ar(*) and 39Ar(K) is precisely accounted for. As most 40Ar/39Ar datasets will be invariably corrupted by large covariance corrections, a full-fledged error analysis as made possible through NEA is clearly desirable in most situations. The demonstrated flexibility of the numeric approach should be profitably extended to other areas of isotope geochemistry involving complex calculation codes such as treated here.",

The mixed layer from fall to winter is cooled by the net surface heat flux, the Ekman transport and the entrainment, and warmed by the horizontal heat convergence resulting from the Kuroshio heat advection. The mixed layer depth is controlled by the entrainment and the horizontal transport divergence/convergence which act to slow the mixed layer deepening from fall to early winter and then in winter deepen the mixed layer. The entrainment velocity is significantly influenced by the temperature difference between the mixed layer and the layer below. The mixed layer shift from its deep to shallow phase occurred in 1985. This shift is preceded the SST-shift in 1988 by three years, and was caused by the horizontal transport divergence anomaly. The horizontal heat COnvergence of the Kuroshio Extension caused the SST-shift in 1988, whereas its anomaly had been already positive since 1983. The delay from 1983 to 1987 can be attributed to the effects of the negative fall-SST anomaly, stronger surface heat flux and Ekman cooling and the shoaling of the mixed layer depth. It is suggested that the Kuroshio current system plays a major role in forcing the SST-shift and thus the subsequent climate regime shift. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Altered samples from this database have been identified using a variety of univariate and multivariate statistical and visualization techniques. Alteration maps are produced for each method, and compared to known gold mineralization using the weights of evidence (WofE) technique. Major oxide data are interpolated using different sample groups (all, altered, unaltered, normalized samples), and anomalous concentrations are separated from background using breakpoints on probability plots of the data, as well as statistics generated from WofE analysis. These maps are also evaluated, using WofE analysis, with respect to locations of known gold prospects. The atypical normative mineral method is more sensitive for identifying alteration in felsic rocks (felsic volcanic rocks, granitoids), whereas the volatile method is more sensitive for detecting alteration in mafic volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks. Altered samples are characterized by higher SiO2, K2O and MnO concentrations, and lower MgO and TiO2 concentrations. Areas within the greenstone belt characterized by high concentrations of CaO, Fe, K2O and Al2O3 were found to the best predictors of the known gold prospects. Anomalously high concentrations of these oxides reflect carbonatization, Fe-carbonate alteration and potassic alteration trends, and indicate that these alteration styles are spatially related to gold mineralization. The WofE method is a useful technique with which to evaluate the geochemical maps produced in this paper. The WofE technique is useful not only for comparing geochemical anomalies to the location of known gold prospects, but also for providing a quantitative measure of association between anomalies and gold prospects. Furthermore, the gold potential maps generated using WofE not only highlight (or predict) known areas of gold mineralization, but also identify high potential areas where no known mineralization occurs. A number of areas within the SGB have been identified as having high gold potential on many of the geochemical maps produced in this paper. Many of these areas coincide with areas of known gold mineralization; however, others are enigmatic and await follow-up exploration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The La Palma sediment wave field covers some 20,000 km2 of the continental slope and rise, and consists of sediment waves with wave heights of up to 70 m and wavelengths of up to 2.4 km. The wave crestlines have a complex morphology, with common bifurcation and a clear sinuosity. Waves have migrated upslope through time. Cores recovered from the wave field contain volcaniclastic turbidites interbedded with pelagic/hemipelagic layers. The wave field is interpreted as having formed beneath unconfined turbidity currents. A simple, previously published, two-layer model is applied to the waves, revealing that they formed beneath turbidity currents flowing at 10-100 cm/s-1, with a flow thickness of 60-400 m and a sediment concentration of 26-427 mg/l. The El Julan sediment wave field lies within a turbidity current channel on the southwest flank of El Hierro. The sediment waves display wave heights of about 6 m and wavelengths of up to 1.2 km. The waves are migrating upslope, and migration is most rapid in the centre of the channel where the flow velocity is highest. This wave field has been formed by channelised turbidity currents originating on the flanks of El Hierro. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We introduce the concise all pairs profiling (CAPP) method for concise, intelligible, and approximate profiling of large classifications. The method compares all classes pairwise and then minimizes the overall number of features needed to guarantee that each pair of classes is contrasted by at least one feature. Then each class profile gets its own minimized list of features, annotated with how these features contrast the class from the others.

Instead, the CF spider uses commercial Web-search engines to find pages likely to contain lists in the domain of interest, and then applies previously proposed heuristics to extract lists from these pages. We show that data collected by this spider are nearly as effective for CF as data collected from real users, and more effective than data collected by two plausible hand-programmed spiders. In some cases, autonomously spidered data can also be combined with actual user data to improve performance.",

        "Absrtact": "The building of intelligent monitoring and diagnostic systems for complex industrial domains tends to be hindered by the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck. Creating good knowledge bases for such tasks is notoriously difficult, especially where human experts are not readily available. High dimensionality of the domain attributes presents a further obstacle for a number of rule-induction algorithms which would, otherwise, have the potential for automating knowledge acquisition. This paper attempts to tackle both problems, by proposing a highly modular framework for data-driven fuzzy ruleset induction incorporating a dimensionality-reduction step based on rough set theory. This removes redundant and information-poor attributes from the data, thereby significantly increasing the speed of the induction algorithm, which is employed to generalise historic data into fuzzy association rules. The aid of dimensionality reduction extends past the training stage of the system into its runtime. By removing information-poor attributes, the implemented system is kept simple by requiring fewer connections to physical instrumentation, while the system's response times are increased. The paper introduces the techniques jointly forming the proposed framework, and demonstrates the applicability of the approach by building a monitoring system for an urban water treatment plant. The results of this application are presented and discussed, and comparisons to alternative approaches are given.",

We generalize these methods, in particular, center-of-mass-prediction (COM-prediction) and local linear prediction (LL-prediction), to multivariate time series. The use of multivariate prediction techniques is especially interesting when time series are short but several variables have been measured simultaneously. These additional variables can sometimes supply information to perform good predictions that otherwise could only be obtained from longer time series. In contrast to non-local prediction methods, next neighbor techniques are applicable to non-stationary time series. This is particularly valuable for time series obtained under non-laboratory conditions, as in environmental science, where boundary conditions are not controllable. The application of our methods to the prediction of zooplankton data, collected in the German North Sea close to Helgoland island, turns out to be promising. \u00a9 2000 IMACS/Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "This paper presents a novel procedure to improve a class of learning systems known as lazy learning algorithms by optimizing the selection of variables and their attendant weights through an artificial neural network and a genetic algorithm. The procedure utilizes its previous knowledge base - also called a case base - to select an effective subset for adaptation. In particular, the procedure explores a space of N variables and generates a reduced space of M dimensions. This is achieved through clustering and compaction. The clustering stage involves the minimization of distances among individuals within the same class while maximizing the distances among different classes. The compaction stage involves the elimination of the irrelevant or redundant feature dimensions. To achieve these two goals concurrently through the evolutionary process, new measures of fitness have been developed. The metrics lead to procedures which exhibit superior characteristics in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The efficiency springs from a reduction in the number of features required for analysis, thereby saving on computational cost as well as data collection requirements. The utility of the new techniques is validated against a variety of data sets from natural and commercial sources.",

One way to improve gene prediction accuracy, proven to be relevant for prokaryotes, is to consider more than one model of genes. Thus, we used our classification of Arabidopsis thaliana genes in two classes (CU1 and CU2), previously delineated according to statistical features, in the GeneMark gene identification program. For each gene class, as well as for the two classes combined, a Markov model was developed (respectively, GM-CU1, GM-CU2 and GM-all) and then used on a test set of 168 genes to compare their respective efficiency. We concluded from this analysis that GM-CU1 is more sensitive than GM-CU2 which seems to be more specific to a gene type. Besides, GM-all does not give better results than GM-CU1 and combining results from GM-CU1 and GM-CU2 greatly improve prediction efficiency in comparison with predictions made with GM-all only. Thus, this work confirms the necessity to consider more than one gene model for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes, and to look for gene classes in order to build these models.

        "Absrtact": "TNT Equivalency methods are widely used for vapour cloud explosion blast modeling. Presently, however, other types of models are available which do not have the fundamental objections TNT Equivalency models have. TNO Multi-Energy method is increasingly accepted as a more reasonable alternative to be used as a simple and practical method. Computer codes based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) like AutoReaGas, developed by TNO and Century Dynamics, could be used also in case a more rigorous analysis is required. Application of the Multi-Energy method requires knowledge of two parameters describing the explosion: a charge size and a charge strength. During the last years, research has led to an improved determination of the charge strength (i.e., the class number or source overpressure) to be chosen to apply the blast charts. A correlation has been derived relating the charge strength to a set of parameters describing the boundary conditions of the flammable cloud and the fuel in the cloud. A simple approach may not be satisfactory in all situations. The overpressure distribution inside a vapour cloud explosion is generally not homogeneous and the presence of obstructions causes directional blast propagation in the near field. A CFD approach, in which the actual situation is modeled, supplies case-specific results. An overview of the key aspects relevant to the application of the Multi-Energy method and CFD modeling is provided. Then the application of the two methods is demonstrated for an example problem involving the calculation of the explosion blast load on a structure at some distance from the explosion in an offshore platform complex.

It is up to the user to refine the query by guessing how the query constraints must be tightened or relaxed and then go through another submit/response cycle. Furthermore, once results are displayed, typically no further exploration capabilities are offered. Web applications requiring interactive exploration of databases (e.g. e-commerce) need that the above submit/response metaphor be replaced with a continuous querying metaphor that seamlessly integrates querying with result browsing.

Linear sorption isotherms and first order degradation sub-models are used to simulate pesticide sorption and transformation. The first order degradation rates are reduced when temperature and moisture stress in the soil profile occur. The model is conceived to describe pesticide fate within rigid mineral soils. Model tests were therefore done using data collected at a sandy (Vredepeel) and a loamy soil (Weiherbach). Both field data and lysimeter data were used to evaluate the performance to describe water, bromide, ethoprophos, bentazone and isoproturon transport in soil. The evaluation procedure presented by Vanclooster et al. (Agric. Water Mgmt., Vol. 44, pp. 1-19) was completely adopted. The measured soil moisture in the sandy soil could only successfully be described after calibrating the hydraulic functions using field observed soil moisture profiles. In addition, the predicted balance terms, such as the soil water drainage, were subject to a lot of uncertainty. Bromide transport in the sandy soil was poorly described with the equilibrium solute transport model. Anomalies were also observed when simulating the transport of the inert tracer in the lysimeter at the loamy site. The fate of the weakly sorbing bentazone component was appropriately described at the Vredepeel field site. However, the retardation of the strongly sorbing ethoprophos and isoproturon components was poorly simulated. Further, the pesticide dissipation varied considerably in time, which could not be accounted for with the first order degradation model. The need for model calibration illustrates the constraints when using mechanistic models such as WAVE to predict field scale pesticide fate and transport. The adoption of a mechanistic model for registration purposes may therefore be subjected to a lot of uncertainty. In addition, processes affecting pesticide fate and transport are still poorly represented within the model. Deficiencies are related to the description of non-linear sorption, time dependent pesticide degradation, and pesticide volatilisation.

        "Absrtact": "Neutron diffraction data for water and ice in the form of OO, OH and HH partial structure factors now exist over a temperature range 220-673 K, and at pressures up to ~400 MPa. In order for these data to be useful for comparing with different computer simulations and theories of water, it is first necessary to Fourier transform them to the corresponding site-site radial distribution functions. The process of doing this is not straightforward because of the inherent systematic uncertainties in the data, which arise primarily in the case of neutron scattering, from the inelasticity or recoil effects that can distort the experimental data. In this paper, it is shown that the empirical potential structure refinement procedure, which attempts to fit a three-dimensional ensemble of water molecules to all three partial structure factors simultaneously, leads to improved reliability in the extracted radial distribution functions. There are still some uncertainties, primarily associated with the hardness of the repulsive core of the intermolecular potential, which current data are not precise enough to resolve. The derived empirical potentials show some variability associated with particular experiments. General trends can be discerned however which indicate polarisation effects may be significant when effective intermolecular potentials are used over a wide temperature and density range.

The Hollister Ridge is a major volcanic system located on the Western flank of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR), immediately south of the Eltanin Fracture Zones (FZs). We find or confirm two anomalous characteristics: the occurrence of seven normal faulting events on the transform segments, expressing extension across the plate boundary in the azimuth N26\u00b0W, and more than 90% deficiency in the seismic moment released during strike-slip events on the transforms, as compared to the rate expected from kinematic models. Other seismic properties are typical of the seismicity of a fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge (MOR) system. In particular, we could not document a single teleseismically recorded event on the Hollister Ridge; earthquakes are confined to narrow TFs with no activity present on the ridge segments. The transform events have regular frequency-moment statistics, and we could not document any significantly slow sources. These seismic properties generally support conventional plate tectonics models such as NUVEL-1, and cannot be reconciled with a proposed reorientation of the Pacific plate 4 Ma ago.

The quantification of such factors represents a step-forward in the derivation of Level II critical levels for ozone. The weighting factors presented are derived from published literature on the sensitivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and plantain (Plantago major) to ozone at different growth stages. Weighting functions were calculated using either multiple linear regression or the reciprocal residual mean square (RMS-1). The resulting weights were transformed into multiplication factors to be applied to the monthly AOT40 during the 3-month assessment period of critical level exceedance. Interspecific differences were too large to allow for the development of a unified weighting function for the three species considered. For wheat grain yield, the derived multiplication factors varied by almost four-fold (0.40, 1.06, 1.54), while those for bean pod yield varied by only about 25% (0.85, 1.01, 1.14). The available data for plantain were restricted to short-term studies conducted under controlled conditions. These data were not suitable for the derivation of weighting factors comparable to those derived for bean and wheat. Based on known differences in wheat development and phenology across Europe, the need for a geographic differentiation of the time period for the calculation of the critical level exceedances is also discussed and examples provided of the adoption of the derived weightings in the mapping of critical level exceedances. Differences between critical level exceedance maps using weighted and unweighted AOT40 calculations are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Two EEV electronic noses with identical sensors were used to read milk samples stored for up to 12 days. Six replicate readings were separated to `calibration' (four replicates) and `unknown' (two replicates) sets. Discriminant function analysis was applied to evaluate `unknowns' in `calibration' sets. When `old unknowns' were converted and classified in `new calibrations', correct classification rates (CCR) were 2/12, 3/12 and 7/12 for F1, F2 and F3, respectively. Also, neural networks were used to either transform one `calibration' set to another (CCR = 8/12 and 9/12), or to evaluate the `unknown' sets in the `calibration' sets (CCR = 7/12).

Water-limited potential, or maximum, yield is assumed to be a linearly increasing function of seasonal rainfall. In addition, the quantity of nutrients required by a crop to achieve water-limited potential yield and the nutrient availability are also expressed as functions of seasonal rainfall. This rainfall-dependent Mitscherlich equation is evaluated using data from agronomic (nitrogen x phosphorus) experiments conducted under rainfed conditions in the semi-arid region of Syria. The analysis showed that rainfall explained most of the variation in yield between locations and seasons, but that the moisture-dependent nutrient part of the Mitscherlich equation explained a small but significant part of the yield variation as well. The model discussed in this paper appears to provide a framework for a Mitscherlich-type approach to describing crop response to nutrient availability c.q. fertilizer application under rainfed conditions in the semi-arid regions.",

The cell density of total nannoplankton decreased significantly in some nearshore stations along the Western Australian coast where the Leeuwin Current flows. A total of 92 taxa were identified by SEM observation from 118 of the samples, i.e. those which had common nannoplankton and allowed the distinction between upper- and lower-photic zone floras. The most abundant taxa were classified into three main groups and two independent species based on their distribution pattern. Of the latter, Umbellosphaera irregularis is common in the shallower samples in the tropics, whilst Gephyrocapsa oceanica occurs in isolated patches. Group U taxa (Discosphaera tubifera, Rhabdosphaera clavigera var. stylifera and Umbellosphaera tenuis) occur in the shallower depths of the subtropical water. Group UL taxa, which include Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericasonii, Syracosphaera spp., Umbilicosphaera hulburtiana and various other taxa whose coccospheres are covered by holococcoliths (holococcolithophores), are common in the subtropics. Group L taxa, which are composed of Florisphaera profunda. Oolithotus antillarum, Gladiolithus flabellatus and Algirosphaera oryza, are most common in the deep water. In order to clarify the mega-trends of floral variations in the upper- and lower-photic zone communities, we obtained the following two rations. The ratio of U. irregularis to groups U + UL in the upper-photic community is positively related to temperature, whereas its relationship with salinity and water density is negative. In the lower-photic community, the ratio of group L to UL varies in the nutrient-poor environments, but is consistently high in eutrophic environments. The occurrence of G. oceanica is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity and lower water density in the upper-photic community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: The management of heart failure (HF) by cardiologists may be better than that of other physicians in that cardiologists' treatment choices more frequently conform with published guidelines and the results of clinical trials. Whether cardiologists' management of HF is more or less cost- effective is up for debate. Methods: Information on all 1995 New York state hospital discharges assigned ICD-9-CM codes indicative of HF in the principal diagnosis position was obtained. Demographic and clinical characteristics, process of care, resource utilization, and short-term HF-related outcomes were compared between patients of cardiologists and patients of other physicians. Results: A total of 44,926 patients were identified, with 10,506 (23%) receiving care from cardiologists, 28,300 (63%) from internists, 4812 (11%) from family practitioners, and 1308 (3%) from other physicians. Patients of cardiologists were younger, more frequently male, and less frequently residents of nursing homes. They were more likely to have associated cardiovascular diagnoses but less likely to have comorbid general medical conditions. Patients of cardiologists were more likely to undergo cardiac catheterization (9%) than those of internists (3%) and family practice (2%) physicians but had similar adjusted hospital length of stay and charges. Mortality and hospital readmission rates for HF were similar among the groups. Patients in the 'other' group (managed mostly by surgeons) were the youngest, underwent more invasive and cardiac surgical procedures, and had the longest length of stay and highest hospital charges. Conclusions: Cardiologists' management of HF is not economically disadvantageous. The relations among physician specialty, process of care, resource utilization, and clinical outcomes require further study before rational and evidence- based health care staffing recommendations can be formulated.",

        "Absrtact": "Lesions in estuarine finfish are associated with a variety of organisms including parasites and bacterial, viral, and fungal infectious agents. In addition, trauma, suboptimal water quality, and other abiotic stress factors may result in the loss of homeostasis. We have observed solitary ulcerative lesions on menhaden sampled from the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, the Pamlico River, North Carolina, and the St. Johns River, Florida. Histologically, the lesions demonstrated a marked chronic inflammatory infiltrate and granulomas in response to fungal hyphae throughout large areas of exposed necrotic muscle. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria were also observed in the lesions, a common finding in ulcers of aquatic organisms. Similar observations in menhaden and other species have been described previously in the literature as ulcerative mycosis, mycotic granulomatosis, red spot disease, and epizootic ulcerative syndrome. Despite the many different known causes of fish lesions, the popular press and the scientific literature have recently emphasized Pfiesteria piscicida and other Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates (and their bioactive compounds) as the primary causative agent for finfish lesions, particularly mycotic granulomatous ulcers in Atlantic menhaden. While some laboratory data suggest that Pfiesteria may play a role in field-observed lesions, much more cause-and-effect evidence is needed to determine the importance of other risk factors, both alone or and in combination with Pfiesteria. In order to better understand the etiology of lesion initiation and progression in estuarine finfish, accurate assessments of environmental conditions collected on appropriate temporal and spatial scales, and fish morphological indicators consistent with gross and histological pathologic terminology, should be used for reporting fish lesion observations and kills. Further, this outlook will help to avoid bias and may foster a broader perspective for examining the health of estuarine systems in general. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "The Archaean rocks of the Yilgarn Craton comprise the largest geological entity in Western Australia and one of the largest areas of Archaean crust anywhere in the world. However, poor outcrop has prevented a thorough understanding of the structure of the crust in the region, a subject of particular interest being the relationship between high-grade metamorphic rocks in the west, and lower-grade granitoid-greenstone terrains further east. Interpretation of previously unpublished seismic refraction data, combined with the re-interpretation of published data, allows crustal velocity structure in the southwest of the Craton to be resolved. Overall, the structure is similar to shield areas elsewhere in the world, the data defining a two-layered crust with an average thickness of about 35 km. However, significant lateral variations in velocity structure are also observed, and these coincide with a terrane boundary previously postulated on the basis of geological observations and seismic reflection data. The terrane boundary dips to the east, extends through the entire crust, and is notable for an area of anomalously high seismic velocity in the lower crust. Two possible interpretations of the high-velocity zone are proposed. Firstly, it is due to the presence of mafic to ultramafic intrusions. Secondly, and the preferred interpretation, the high-velocity zone is a fault-bounded mega-sliver, which may be a suspect terrane in its own right, perhaps with oceanic affinities. The results of the seismic experiment strongly support tectonic models for Yilgarn Craton based on terrane tectonics. The possibility that the terrane boundary is being reactivated by contemporary stresses also provides a plausible explanation for the local intra-plate seismicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Observations from 145 submersible dives are used to create a database of mid-ocean ridge scarp topography and lithology. Seafloor lithologies are classified into extrusives, basaltic talus, dykes, gabbros and serpentinites, and the dive locations are broadly classified according to whether they are close to transform valleys and as a function of ridge spreading rate. The database is used to determine whether there is any difference in the maximum slope for each rock type, which might relate to differences in rock jointing, cohesion or friction properties. There is a common perception that lower crustal rocks form steeper slopes than shallower crustal rocks but until now there has been little evidence to support or refute this idea. From our analysis we find a tendency for gabbro and dykes to form steeper slopes than serpentinite. The 90th percentile of each lithology slope distribution, used as a measure of limiting slope, is 43\u00b0, 39\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 for gabbro, dykes and serpentinite, respectively. Lithologic control on slope is weak, however, compared to overall slope variability in these mid-ocean ridge settings so seafloor relief is likely to be a poor guide to underlying geology. We speculate on the structure of eroding fault scarps, outline the implications for attempts to infer active faults from talus ramp activity and discuss more generally factors affecting the geomorphology of mid-ocean ridge slopes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Several in vitro model systems have been developed to predict drug phototoxicity but none have been conducted in parallel with controlled clinical phototoxicity studies on systemically administered pharmaceuticals. The in vitro phototoxicity of eight fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, grepafloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, trovafloxacin, BAYy3118, moxifloxacin) was determined by exposing Chinese hamster fibroblasts to UVA radiation. Cell damage was quantified with standard MTT or neutral red assays and an in vitro phototoxic index calculated (PI(vit)=% cell viability with UVA alone / % cell viability with UVA + FQ) for each endpoint. Clinical photosensitising ability of the eight systemically administered FQ was investigated using double-blind, placebo and positive controlled, clinical skin phototesting of normal subjects. Minimal erythema doses at 365\u00b130nm were determined before and after 6-7 days of FQ ingestion and PI(clin) (minimal erythema dose without FQ / minimal erythema dose with FQ) calculated. Linear regression analysis of PI(vit) vs PI(clin) gave correlations of up to 0.893. Principal components analysis of PI(vit), daily dose, plasma levels and photophysical (absorption) properties of the eight FQ showed that phototoxic (arbitrarily defined as PI(clin) \u2265 2) and non-phototoxic (PI(clin) < 2) FQ could be completely discriminated using these parameters, and that the in vitro models were able to rank the relative phototoxic potential of the eight FQ.

The uniqueness of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (CLIP, 92-74 Ma) with respect to other Cretaceous oceanic plateaus is its extensive sub-aerial exposures, providing an excellent basis to investigate the temporal and compositional relationships within a starting plume head. We present major element, trace element and initial Sr-Nd-Pb isotope composition of 40 extrusive rocks from the Caribbean Plateau, including onland sections in Costa Rica, Colombia and Curacao as well as DSDP Sites in the Central Caribbean. Even though the lavas were erupted over an area of ~3 X 106 km2, the majority have strikingly uniform incompatible element patterns (La/Yb = 0.96 \u00b1 0.16, n = 64 out of 79 samples, 2\u03c3) and initial Nd-Pb isotopic compositions (e.g. 143Nd/144Nd(in) = 0.51291 \u00b1 3, \u03b5(Ndi) = 7.3 \u00b1 0.6, 206Pb/204Pb(in) = 18.86 \u00b1 0.12, n = 54 out of 66, 2\u03c3). Lavas with endmember compositions have only been sampled at the DSDP Sites, Gorgona Island (Colombia) and the 65-60 Ma accreted Quepos and Osa igneous complexes (Costa Rica) of the subsequent hotspot track. Despite the relatively uniform composition of most lavas, linear correlations exist between isotope ratios and between isotope and highly incompatible trace element ratios. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotope and trace element signatures of the chemically enriched lavas are compatible with derivation from recycled oceanic crust, while the depleted lavas are derived from a highly residual source. This source could represent either oceanic lithospheric mantle left after ocean crust formation or gabbros with interlayered ultramafic cumulates of the lower oceanic crust. High 3He/4He in olivines of enriched picrites at Quepos are ~ 12 times higher than the atmospheric ratio suggesting that the enriched component may have once resided in the lower mantle. Evaluation of the Sm-Nd and U-Pb isotope systematics on isochron diagrams suggests that the age of separation of enriched and depleted components from the depleted MORB source mantle could have been \u2264 500 Ma before CLIP formation and interpreted to reflect the recycling time of the CLIP source. Mantle plume heads may provide a mechanism for transporting large volumes of possibly young recycled oceanic lithosphere residing in the lower mantle back into the shallow MORB source mantle.",

        "Absrtact": "Geographical information systems (GIS) are becoming an increasingly integral component of natural resource management activities worldwide. However, despite some indication that these tools are receiving attention within the aquaculture community, their deployment for spatial decision support in this domain continues to be very slow. This situation is attributable to a number of constraints including a lack of appreciation of the technology, limited understanding of GIS principles and associated methodology, and inadequate organizational commitment to ensure continuity of these spatial decision support tools. This paper analyzes these constraints in depth, and includes reviews of basic GIS terminology, methodology, case studies in aquaculture and future trends. The section on GIS terminology addresses the two fundamental types of GIS (raster and vector), and discusses aspects related to the visualization of outcomes. With regard to GIS methodology, the argument is made for close involvement of end users, subject matter specialists and analysts in all projects. A user-driven framework, which involves seven phases, to support this process is presented together with details of the degree of involvement of each category of personnel, associated activities and analytical procedures. The section on case studies reviews in considerable detail four aquaculture applications which are demonstrative of the extent to which GIS can be deployed, indicate the range in complexity of analytical methods used, provide insight into issues associated with data procurement and handling, and demonstrate the diversity of GIS packages that are available. Finally, the section on the future of GIS examines the direction in which the technology is moving, emerging trends with regard to analytical methods, and challenges that need to be addressed if GIS is to realize its full potential as a spatial decision support tool for aquaculture.

In this paper, we propose to model the spatio-temporal myocardial displacement field by a cosine series model fitted to the entire tagged dataset. The method has been implemented in two dimensions (2D)+time. Its accuracy was successively evaluated on actual tagged data and on a simulated two-dimensional (2D) moving heart model. The simulations show that an overall theoretical mean accuracy of 0.1 mm can be attained with adequate model orders. The influence of the tagging pattern was evaluated and computing time is provided as a function of the model complexity and data size. This method provides an analytical and hierarchical model of the 2D+time deformation inside the myocardium. It was applied to actual tagged data from a healthy subject and from a patient with ischemia. The results demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed model for this evaluation. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The catch history and fisheries biology of Arripis truttaceus is described to outline the need for information on migration and survival in stock assessment. A model was developed to quantify annual rates of exploitation, survival and migration of juvenile and mature fish in nursery and adult areas using tag recovery data. The basic procedure for estimating these rates was to construct a functional model for recoveries by age and location, and to seek parameter values (using non-linear estimation techniques) for this model that provide a best least-squares fit to the recovery data. The sensitivity of the parameter estimates to some potential effects of tagging, and other possible biases, was assessed by analysing data subsets from which tag groups had been omitted according to 14 scenarios of potential bias and time and place of tagging. Annual rates of exploitation were estimated at 0.71 \u00b1 0.015 for adult fish, and 0.17 \u00b1 0.006 for fully recruited juveniles. Best estimates of annual rates of natural survival were 0.54 \u00b1 0.043 for mature fish and 0.74 \u00b1 0.024 for juvenile fish. For maturing fish in the South Australian nursery area, the best estimates of annual rates of migration to the spawning area were about 0.2 for 4 year old fish, and 0.49 \u00b1 0.046 for fish of five years and older. The relative vulnerability to fishing in the South Australian nursery area was 0.51 \u00b1 0.047 for 0+ fish and 0.88 \u00b1 0.044 for 1 year old fish. Parameter estimates were most sensitive to the omission of data from tagging of older fish in the nursery area, and on mature fish in the adult area. Delay of migration by the tagging procedure caused underestimation of migration-at-age. Lack of mixing of tagged and untagged fish was considered to cause overestimation of the relative vulnerability to fishing of 0+ fish. Overall parameter estimates generally agreed with ancillary data from catch sampling and population surveys, but migration rates from nursery areas to the adult area were lower than expected. The best estimates provide the basis for other stock assessments to evaluate alternative harvesting policies in the fishery for Arripis truttaceus.",

Results show that probable in vivo configuration of 18S rRNA is not predictable using current free-energy models to fold the entire molecule concurrently. This suggests that refinements in free-energy minimization algorithms are needed. Molecular phylogenetic datasets were created using 18S rRNA nucleotide alignments produced by CLUSTAL and rigorous interpretation of homologous position based on certain secondary substructures. Phylogenetic analysis of a hemipteran data matrix of 18S rDNA sequences placed peloridiids sister to Heteroptera. Resolution of affiliations between the three main euhemipteran lineages was unresolved. The peloridiid 18S RNA model presented here provides the most accurate template to date for aligning homologous nucleotides of hemipteran taxa. Using folded 18S rRNA to infer homology of character as morpho-molecular structures or nucleotides and scoring particular sites or substructures is discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

Monazite inclusions within garnets from three samples yield ages of ~44-36 Ma, whereas matrix grains within one sample are typically younger (30-26 Ma). Y depletion of these younger matrix grains indicates that they grew after garnet had crystallised. The recognition of episodic monazite growth during regional metamorphism, first at greenschist facies (before garnet growth) and secondly at upper amphibolite facies (post-dating garnet growth), allows relative growth ages of the occluding garnet to be calculated. These are in excellent agreement with Sm-Nd garnet ages from surrounding units. This approach not only provides a ready means of obtaining porphyroblast growth ages but also allows the combination of precise U-Th-Pb data from metamorphic monazite with thermobarometric information obtained from rock-forming minerals.

Soil resistance to rooting seems to be an important factor of the variability. Field studies are consistent with leaf-scale ones.

        "Absrtact": "The Western Gneiss Region (WGR) marks the outcrop of a composite terrane consisting of variably re-worked Proterozoic basement and parautochthonous or autochthonous cover units. The WGR exhibits a gross structural, petrographic and thermobarometric zonation from southeast to northwest, reflecting an increasing intensity of Scandian (late Palaeozoic) metamorphic and structural imprint. Scandian-aged eclogites have been widely (though for kinetic reasons not invariably) stabilised in metabasic rocks but have suffered varying degrees of retrogression during exhumation. In the region between the Jostedal mountains and Nordjord, eclogites commonly have distinctively prograde-zoned garnets with amphibolite or epidote-amphibolite facies solid inclusions suites and lack any evidence for stability of coesite (high pressure [HP] eclogites). In the south of this area, in Sunnfjord, eclogites locally contain glaucophane as an inclusion or matrix phase. North of Nordfjord, eclogites mostly lack prograde zoning and evidence for coesite, either as relics as relics or replacive polycrystalline quartz, is present in both eclogites (ultrahigh pressure [UHP] eclogites) and, rarely, gneisses. Coesite or polycrystalline quartz after coesite has now been found in eight new localities, including one close to a microdiamond-bearing gneiss. These new discoveries suggest that, by a conservative estimate, the UHP terrane, in the WGR covers a coastal strip of about 5000 km2 between outer Nordfjord and Moldefjord. A 'mixed HP/UHP zone' containing both HP and UHP eclogites is confirmed by our observations, and is extended a further 40 km east along Nordfjord. Thermobarometry on phengite-bearing eclogites has been used to quantify the regional distribution of pressure (P) and temperature (T) across the WGR. Overall, a scenario emerges where P and T progressively increase from 500\u00b0C and 16 kbar in Sunnfjord to > 800\u00b0C and 32 kbar in outer Moldefjord, respectively, in line with the distribution of eclogite petrographic features. Results are usually consistent with the silica polymorph present or inferred. The P-T conditions define a linear array in the P-T plane with a slope of roughly 5\u00b0C/km, with averages for petrographic groups lying along the trend according to their geographic distribution from SE to NW, hence defining a clear field gradient. This P-T gradient might be used to support the frequently postulated model for northwesterly subduction of the WGC as a coherent body. However, the WGC is clearly a composite edifice built from several tectonic units. Furthermore, the mixed HP/UHP zone seems to mark a step in the regional P gradient, indicating a possible tectonic break and tectonic juxtaposition of the HP and UHP units. Lack of other clear evidence for a tectonic break in the mixed zone dicatates caution in this interpretation, and we cannot discount the possibility that the mixed zone is, at least, partly a result of kinetic operating near the HP-UHP transition. Overall, if the WGC has been subducted during the Scandian orogeny, it has retained its general fown-slab pattern of P and T in spite of any disruption during exhumation. Garnetiferous peridotites derived from subcontinental lithospheric mantle may be restricted to the UHP terrane and appear to decorate basement-cover contacts in many cases. P-T conditions calculated from previously published data for both relict (Proterozoic lithospheric mantle?) porphyroclast assemblages and Scandian (subduction-related?) neoblastic assemblages do not define such a clear field gradient, but probably record a combination of their pre-orogenic P-T record with Scandian re-working during and after subduction entrainment. A crude linear array in the P-T plane defined by peridotite samples may be, in part, an artifact of errors in the geobarometric methods. A spatial association of mantle-derived peridotites with the UHP terrane and with basement-cover contacts is consistent with a hypothesis for entrainment of at least some of them as 'foreign' fragments into a crustal UHP terrane during subduction of the Baltic continental margin to depths of > 100 km, and encourages a more mobilistic view of the assembly of the WGC from its component lithotectonic elements.

It has been postulated that GM2-AP extracts single GM2 molecules from membranes and presents them in soluble form to \u03b2-hexosaminidase A for cleavage of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and conversion to GM3. The high affinity of GM2-AP for GM2 is based on specific recognition of the oligosaccharide moiety as well as the ceramide lipid tail. Genetic defects in GM2-AP result in an atypical form of Tay-Sachs disease known as variant AB GM2 gangliosidosis. The 2.0 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of GM2-AP reported here reveals a previously unobserved fold whose main feature is an eight-stranded cup-shaped anti-parallel \u03b2-pleated sheet. The striking feature of the GM2-AP structure is that it possesses an accessible central hydrophobic cavity rather than a buried hydrophobic core. The dimensions of this cavity (12 \u00c5 x 14 \u00c5 x 22 \u00c5) are suitable for binding 18-carbon lipid acyl chains. Flexible surface loops and a short \u03b1-helix decorate the mouth of the \u03b2-cup and may control lipid entry to the cavity. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "It has been proposed that stomatal flux of ozone would provide a more reliable basis than ozone exposure indices for the assessment of the risk of ozone damage to vegetation across Europe. However, implementation of this approach requires the development of appropriate models which need to be rigorously tested against actual data collected under field conditions. This paper describes such an assessment of the stomatal component of the model described by Emberson et al. (2000. Modelling stomatal ozone flux across Europe. Environmental Pollution 110). Model predictions are compared with field measurements of both stomatal conductance (g(s)) and calculated ozone flux for shoots of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies) growing in the Tyrol Mountains in Austria. The model has been developed to calculate g(s) as a function of leaf phenology and four environmental variables: photosynthetic flux density (PFD), temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture deficit (SMD). The model was run using climate data measured on site, although the SMD component was omitted since the necessary data were not available. The model parameterisation for Norway spruce had previously been collected from the scientific literature and therefore established independently from the measurement study. Overall, strong associations were found between model predictions and measured values of stomatal conductance to ozone (GO3) and calculated stomatal ozone flux (FO3). Average diurnal profiles of GO3 and FO3 showed good agreement between the field data and modelled values except during the morning period of 1990. The diurnal pattern of ozone flux was determined primarily by PFD and VPD, as there was little diurnal variation in ozone concentration. In general, the model predicted instances of high ozone flux satisfactorily, indicating its potential applicability in identifying areas of high ozone risk for this species.

        "Absrtact": "Maximum intensity projection (MIP) is a volume rendering technique which is used to extract high-intensity structures from volumetric scalar data. At each pixel the highest data value encountered along the corresponding viewing ray is determined. MIP is commonly used to extract vascular structures from medical MRI data sets, i.e., angiography. The usual way to compensate for the loss of spatial and occlusion information in MIP images is to view the data from different view points by rotating them. As the generation of a MIP is usually non-interactive, this is done by calculating multiple images offline and playing them back as an animation. In this paper a novel algorithm is proposed which is capable of interactively generating Maximum Intensity Projection images even on low-end hardware using parallel projection. Two methods for preprocessing data and removing voxels which will due to their neighborhood never contribute to a MIP are discussed. The remaining voxels are stored in a way which guarantees optimal cache coherency regardless of the viewing direction. For use on low-end hardware, a preview-mode is included which renders only the more significant parts of the volume during user interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usability of our data structure for extensions of the MIP technique like MIP with depth-shading and local maximum intensity projection (LMIP).",

        "Absrtact": "The potential of the Chinese insurance market is enormous, as current per capita insurance spending is a fraction of that in other developing economies. The Chinese authorities are aware that the development of an indigenous insurance capability is essential to China's continued economic restructuring, and that foreign insurers have an important role to play in this process. They have thus started to liberalise, albeit cautiously, the policy environment for foreign insurers. One of the crucial strategic questions for such insurers is where to establish their representative offices within China, given the size of the country. This paper uses a Conditional Logit Model to assess the determinants of location choice using a sample of 138 foreign representative offices established over the period 1992-96. Proximity to the headquarters of the Regulatory Authority, openness for the award of operating licenses, current and future market demand, and the presence of other foreign investment are all found to have significant effects upon the choice of location. Cost and infrastructure considerations were generally found to be of little significance. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The objective of this paper is to construct a mesh-model of a newborn skull for finite element analysis to study its deformation when subjected to the forces present during labour. The current state of medical imaging technology has reached a level which allows accurate visualisation and shape recovery of biological organs and body-parts. However, a sufficiently large set of medical images cannot always be obtained, often because of practical or ethical reasons, and the requirement to recover the shape of the biological object of interest has to be met by other means. Such is the case for a newborn skull. A method to recover the three-dimensional (3D) shape from (minimum) two orthogonal atlas images of the object of interest and a homologous object is described. This method is based on matching landmarks and curves on the orthogonal images of the object of interest with corresponding landmarks and curves on the homologous or \u0b00master\u0b01-object which is fully defined in 3D space. On the basis of this set of corresponding landmarks, a thin-plate spline function can be derived to warp from the \u0b00master\u0b01-object space to the \u0b00slave\u0b01-object space. This method is applied to recover the 3D shape of a newborn skull. Images from orthogonal view-planes are obtained from an atlas. The homologous object is an adult skull, obtained from CT-images made available by the Visible Human Project. After shape recovery, a mesh-model of the newborn skull is generated. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976-77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10-15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965-1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone. \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "The Mauritian sugar cane (Saccharum spp.) industry is characterised by high climatic variability both from year-to-year and across ago-climatic zones. There is a need to assess yield variation with a view to facilitate crop management as well as investment decision-making, such as irrigation schemes. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of using crop simulation modelling to quantify potential and attainable yield at contrasting sites. Potential yield is that limited by temperature, radiation, for a given cultivar and season length, while attainable yield has the additional constraint of water supply (rainfall and irrigation where it is applied). The sugar cane module of the Agricultural Productions Systems Simulator (APSIM-Sugar cane) had not been previously used under Mauritian conditions. Hence, the first step is to validate the model using dam from growth analysis experiments with plant and ratoon crops of three contrasting commercial cultivar (R 570, M 13/56 and M 555/60), harvested at two dates (July and October) at two sites. The validation step showed that only a limited number of crop coefficients needed adjustment: those concerning canopy expansion, biomass partitioning and crop development. Linear fit of simulated and observed data were close to the 1:1 line and coefficients of determination were highly significant for LAI (r2=0.66), above-ground biomass (r2=0.84), dry weight of cane (r2=0.73) and sucrose yield (r2=0.78). There was some indication that model modification for the effects of water stress and flowering on canopy development and biomass accumulation would improve the simulations. The model was used to assess the variability in potential and attainable yield at three sites (Pamplemousses, Medine and Reduit) using long-term climate data for the period 1961-1995. Simulations were conducted for rainfed and fully irrigated scenarios. The three sites contrasted in annual rainfall, solar radiation and mean temperature and hence in expected potential and attainable yield. The range in model-simulated yields of cultivar R 570 were close to the range of experimentally observed yields at the selected sites under rainfed and fully irrigated conditions. Simulated yields were more variable under rainfed than irrigated production, with variability increasing across sites as mean annual rainfall decreased. Under rainfed production, yield was poorly correlated with annual rainfall at all sites. At all sites, irrigated yields across the climatic record were highly positively correlated with mean daily solar radiation. The study showed that it is feasible to import a pre-existing model, parameterise it for local cultivars and conduct scenario analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A known amount of inefficiency and random noise is then added to each production plan. Finally we compare the 'true' inefficiency levels to those estimated through the following techniques: stochastic frontiers, DEA, and stochastic DEA (two original models are also developed). All the 'classic' techniques (translog cost function, CRS DEA, VRS DEA) perform well, although the first one can not achieve a satisfactory decomposition of efficiency into its allocative and technical causes. The stochastic DEA models can outperform the 'classics' in some specific situations, but on average they cannot compete with older techniques; however, the two new stochastic DEA models perform better than the standard one.",

Flood basalts make up 85% of the archipelago and are interpreted as the most recent volcanism ( < 40 Ma) from the Kerguelen hotspot which has erupted basalt for the last 115 million years. Based on 40AR/39Ar incremental heating of acid-leached groundmass separates, we report isochron ages ranging from 29.26 \u00b1 0.87 Ma to 24.53 \u00b1 0.29 Ma for 15 basalts from five stratigraphic sections from diverse regions of the archipelago. The oldest dated basalt from the archipelago (~ 29 Ma) is much younger than the ~ 40 Ma age of conjunction between the hotspot and the Southeast Indian Ridge. Basalt eruption seems to have ceased shortly after ~ 24 Ma although small volume, highly evolved lavas and plutons continued to form in the archipelago. The basalt age data suggest an average lava accumulation rate of ~ 1.6\u00b10.9 km/my during the Oligocene. The archipelago's volumetric eruption rate (0.009 km3/yr) is lower than estimates made for the Cretaceous Kerguelen Plateau (1.7 km3/yr) and the Ninetyeast Ridge hotspot track (0.18 km3/yr), suggesting that the late Cenozoic extrusive activity of the Kerguelen plume is waning. Cenozoic volcanism attributed to the Kerguelen plume occurs over a diffuse area with Quaternary eruptions at Heard and McDonald Islands and within the Kerguelen Archipelago. The decreasing eruption rate and areally diffuse volcanism may be explained by the thick lithosphere of the Cretaceous Kerguelen Plateau overriding and insulating the plume. However, if the undated NKP, which underlies the archipelago, formed during the Cenozoic, then, the crustal production rate of the plume from 40 Ma to the present (~ 0.25 km3/yr) would be similar to the crustal production rate (0.23 km3/my) previously estimated for the formation of the Ninetyeast Ridge (~ 82-38 Ma).",

        "Absrtact": "Background: Accurate, reproducible, noninvasive determination of left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) is important for Clinical assessment, risk stratification, selection of therapy and serial monitoring of patients with cardiovascular disease. Three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) approaches have demonstrated significantly greater accuracy than current clinical 2DE, but the clinical utility of 3DE has been limited because of the need for substantial modifications to scanning technique (eg, all image acquisition from a single acoustic window) or cumbersome additional hardware. We describe a novel 3DE system without these imitations and its application to patients. Methods and Results: Twenty-five patients were examined by 3DE, 2DE, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 3DE system used a magnetic scanhead tracking device, and volumes were computed with a novel deformable shell model. End-diastolic volumes and EF by MRI ranged from 96 to 375 mL and 18% to 73%, respectively. There was excellent correlation, without statistically significant differences, between MRI and 3 DE for end-systolic volume (ESV) (r2 = 0.99) and end-diastolic volume (EDV) (r2 = 0.98), ventricular stroke volume (SV) (r2 = 0.93), and EF (r2 = 0.97), with standard error estimates less than 10 mL for volumes and 3% for EF. Conventional 2DE consistently underestimated volumes (EDV, P < .01; ESV, P < .01; SV, P < .05); correlations with MRI were r2 = 0.91 for ESV, r2 = 0.88 for EDV, r2 = 0.62 for SV, and r2 = 0.72 for EF. Standard error estimates ranged from 16 to 20 mL for ventricular volumes and 9% for EF. Interobserver variability was reduced 3-fold with use of 3DE. Conclusions: The novel 3 DE system allows unrestricted selection and combination of acoustic windows in a single examination, improves accuracy of estimates of LV volumes and EF 3-fold compared with 2DE, and is practical for routine clinical assessment of LV size and function in patients with a wide range of cardiac pathology.",

We tried a number of weighting schemes, including simple average, Boltzman-weighted average and a variability- weighted average of conformer CoMFA fields to produce an overall field for each molecule, the most successful being the simple average field. We have applied the method to partially rigid, C-and D-ring modified lignan natural product derivatives related to podophyllotoxin, and the biological activities of these as measured against HT29, P388 and A549 cell lines. The modified CoMFA produces more robust regressions than 'standard' CoMFA. The results of the modified CoMFA appear reliable enough to suggest that at least some of these compounds act through more than one mechanism, and that the importance of each mechanism appears to depend on the cell line used.

During this period, the volcano exhibited a pattern of cyclic inflation and deflation with an 8-14 h period. We find that SO2 emission rates, measured by COSPEC, correlate with the amplitude of these tilt cycles, and that higher rates of SO2 emission were associated with stronger ground deformation and enhanced hybrid seismicity. Within tilt cycles, degassing peaks coincide with maximum deformation gradients. Increases in the amount of gas in the magma conduit feeding the dome, probably due to increases in volatile content of ascending magma volume can account for the observed increases in tilt amplitude, hybrid seismicity and SO2 emission rate.

Twice-yearly samples of different age-groups of trout were recorded, together with a more detailed set of records for a further 8 years. These data are used to develop and calibrate a time-dependent population model. A concurrent record of rainfall data for Windermere is aggregated to form seasonal averages and used as an indicator of drought for the region. Drought conditions result in lower than expected stock which can be identified as outliers from the Ricker stock-recruitment curves for each sample. A set of five difference equations, which describe the overlapping trout age-groups, is identified and used to forecast the trout population up to a few years ahead. The model is particularly successful at forecasting population numbers 1-year ahead if the following years drought is taken into account. Incorporation of drought effects into the model significantly improves model forecasts. A linearised stability analysis suggests that long-term drought conditions will have the effect of increasing population stability, although a particularly severe drought, or series of severe droughts, may lead to population decline.

Previous studies of the Brazil-Falkland Current confluence have concentrated on the formation of eddies south of 35\u00b0S. However, in situ measurements and TOPEX/POSEIDON imagery of the region reveal eddies developing as far north as 32\u00b0S. These features are not evident in the coincident AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) imagery. In this study, the origin of the eddies identified are discussed with reference to the contemporary in situ measurements of temperature and salinity. Using the combination of satellite imagery and in situ data, it can be determined that the surface waters of the eddies north of 36\u00b0S are influenced by water from an estuarine source. TOPEX imagery enables the movements and variability of the regions water masses: estuarine outflow, Falkland and Brazil currents, to be monitored synoptically. The combination of satellite imagery and the higher resolution of in situ AMT measurements enables these water masses to be better identified. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Our objective was to determine whether interpregnancy intervals were associated with the risk of premature infants and to define the degree of risk according to interpregnancy interval. Methods: We analyzed 289,842 singleton infants born to parous Mexican-origin Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women in the United States who resided in the same county and delivered between January 1, 1991 and September 30, 1991. Interpregnancy interval was defined as the number of months between the previous live birth and conception of the index pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the risk of interpregnancy interval on very premature (23-32 weeks), moderately premature (33-37 weeks), and term gestation (38-42 weeks). Results: Nearly 37% of women had interpregnancy intervals less than 18 months, 45.5% of women had intervals of 18-59 months, and 17.6% of women had intervals over 59 months. After adjusting for confounding variables, women with intervals less than 18 months were 14-47% more likely to have very premature and moderately premature infants than women with intervals of 18-59 months. Women with intervals over 59 months were 12-45% more likely to have very premature and moderately premature infants than women with intervals of 18-59 months. Conclusion: Women with interpregnancy intervals from 18-59 months had the lowest risk of very premature and moderately premature infants. Further study is needed to define the mechanisms through which interpregnancy interval influences pregnancy outcome. (C) 2000 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",

Many studies anticipate that this can be achieved by analysing patterns of gene expression via the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Thus, functional genomics is, in part, an exercise in pattern classification. Because many genes have known functional classes, the problem of predicting their functional class is a supervised learning problem. However, most pattern classification methods that have been applied to the problem have been unsupervised clustering methods. Consequently, the best classification tools have not always been used. Furthermore, the present functional classes are suboptimal and new unsupervised clustering methods are needed to improve them. Better-structured functional classes will facilitate the prediction of biochemically testable functions.",

Offshore central Oregon, which is the subject of this study, the experiment involved the collection of wide-angle refraction and reflection data along three profiles across the continental margin using ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and hydrophones (OBH) as well as land recorders. Two-dimensional modelling of the travel times provides a detailed velocity structure beneath these profiles. The subducting oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca plate can be traced from the trench to its position some 10 km landward of the coastline. At the coastline, the Moho has a depth of 30 km. The dip of the plate changes from 1.5\u00b0 westward of the trench to about 6.5\u00b0 below the accretionary complex and to about 16\u00b0 further eastward below the coast. The backstop forming western edge of the Siletz terrane, an oceanic plateau that was accreted to North America about 50 Ma ago, is well defined by the observations. It is located about 60 km to the east of the deformation front and has a seaward dip of 40\u00b0. At its seaward edge, the base of the Siletz terrane seems to be in contact with the subducting oceanic crust implying that sediments are unlikely to be subducted to greater depths. The upper oceanic crust is thinner to the east of this contact than to the west. At depths greater than 18 km, the top of the oceanic crust is the origin of pre-critical reflections observable in several land recordings and in the data of one ocean bottom instrument. These reflections are most likely caused by fluids that are released from the oceanic crust by metamorphic facies transition. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Crop and system performance were examined over a 4.5-year-period (nine growing seasons) commencing in October 1991; failure of the rains caused the loss of one cropping season. A rotation of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) and maize (Zea mays L.) was grown during the first five seasons after planting the trees, while maize was grown continuously during the final four seasons. Sole maize was also grown under spectrally neutral shade netting which reduced incident radiation by 25, 50 or 75% to establish the relative importance of shade and below-ground competition for water and nutrients in determining the performance of understorey crops. The above-ground biomass and grain yield of understorey crops were not significantly affected by the presence of grevillea during the first four seasons, but were greatly reduced in subsequent seasons as the trees became increasingly dominant; maize yields reached 50% of the sole crop values only once during the final four seasons, when rainfall was unusually high. The hypothesis that competition for water was the primary limiting factor for understorey crops was supported by the observation that above-ground biomass and grain yield were greater in the shade net treatments than in agroforestry maize, demonstrating that shade was not solely responsible for the substantial yield losses in the latter treatment. Performance ratios (ratio of values for the agroforestry system relative to sole stands) for total above-ground and trunk biomass in grevillea were initially low, reflecting the impact of competition with associated crops during tree establishment, but increased to unity within 2.5 years. Performance ratios for the understorey crops exhibited the reverse trend, initially being close to unity but approaching zero for three of the final four seasons. Performance ratios were never close to unity for both trees and crops during the same season, indicating that there was always competition for available resources irrespective of crop species or tree size. The implications for agroforestry system design and future research are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The collected data far exceeds people's ability to analyze it. Thus, new and efficient methods are needed to discover knowledge from large spatial databases. Most of the spatial data mining methods do not take into account the uncertainty of spatial information. In our work we use objects with broad boundaries, the concept that absorbs all the uncertainty by which spatial data is commonly affected and allows computations in the presence of uncertainty without rough simplifications of the reality. The topological relations between objects with a broad boundary can be organized into a three-level concept hierarchy. We developed and implemented a method for an efficient determination of such topological relations. Based on the hierarchy of topological relations we present a method for mining spatial association rules for objects with uncertainty. The progressive refinement approach is used for the optimization of the mining process.",

        "Absrtact": "Computer models may be useful tools to design management practices for green manures, to maximize N uptake by the following crop while minimizing N losses to teaching. A previous paper tested CERES models predictions of soil processes in the absence of a crop, but did not consider effects of the crop, such as water and N uptake or shading of the soil surface. In this paper, we evaluated the ability of the CERES models to predict N dynamics during wheat and maize growth following legume cover crop (LCC) incorporation. Soil and crop data were collected in 2-year wheat and maize rotations from 1994 to 1998 at the Long Term Research on Agricultural Systems facility at the University of California, Davis. In unfertilized fallow/wheat and LCC/wheat rotations, soil inorganic N content and crop N uptake were mostly within 20% of predicted values, but the greater N uptake by wheat predicted after LCC incorporation (relative to no LCC) did not actually occur. Midwinter N uptake rate of unfertilized wheat was three times that predicted by the model, even though the soil inorganic N was only half that predicted. In maize, following earlier LCC incorporation, inorganic soil N was underestimated throughout growth in 1996 and 1997 (by 25-150 kg N ha-1 in 1996 and 25-55 kg N ha-1 in 1997), due to the underestimates of rapid N mineralization shortly before active maize N uptake. Maize N uptake was predicted within 20% in 1997, but was underestimated by 25-70 kg N ha-1 in 1996. Overpredictions in soil temperature were sometimes of the order of 10\u00b0C, which could cause doubling of metabolic rates, e.g. soil N mineralization. This could explain slight but consistent overpredictions in inorganic soil N in the wheat system, but makes underprediction of soil N in the maize system even more surprising. The CERES models could give a rough estimate of N budget in a wheat rotation following a fallow or late-incorporated LCC. Further improvements of the CERES models should address predictions of winter-grown LCC decomposition after early incorporation (e.g. prior to maize), midwinter wheat N uptake, and soil temperature.

A complex system of northwest-southeast rifts was active contemporaneously with an east-west trending rift. This rift activity led to northward separation of the Falkland Plateau, and formation of the Weddell Sea by sea floor spreading. Atypically, the Jurassic passive margin of Gondwana shows evidence for coeval extension in two directions and a large volume of interpreted magmatic material. This is consistent with initial doming above a mantle plume and we suggest that this resulted in the formation of a triple junction. Magnetic anomalies indicate a series of faults perpendicular to igneous intrusions and extrusions with outlines that range in shape from lozenges to parallel ridges. They show remarkably good spatial correlation with free air gravity anomalies, even in areas of sea ice. We base a structural elements map and timing sequence for the events in the WSE during early Gondwana breakup on anomaly cross-cutting relationships. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The crystal-liquid partition coefficients for Sr and Cr, D(Sr) and D(Cr), have been determined from electron microprobe analyses of plagioclase-liquid and orthopyroxene-liquid pairs produced in melting experiments run at pressures from 1 bar to 27 kbar on two compositions relevant to anorthosite petrogenesis. One is a primitive jotunite (hypersthene monzodiorite: TJ); the other is a sample of an anorthositic dyke (500B). Results indicate that D(Sr) (plag/liq) remains nearly constant with increasing pressure (TJ: 1.7 to 2.6; 500B: 0.9 to 1.4). This modest variation apparently results from the combined and opposing effects of crystal chemistry and pressure: D(Sr) increases with the albite content of plagioclase, which itself increases with pressure along a composition's liquidus, so pressure must have an intrinsic negative effect. The two models for D(Sr) [J. Blundy, B. Wood, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 55 (1991) 193-209; I. Bindeman, A. Davis, M. Drake, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 62 (1998) 1175-1193] that take into account the strong correlation between D(Sr) and plagioclase composition overestimate D(Sr) at high pressure; whereas the two models that ignore plagioclase composition [S. Morse, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 56 (1992) 1735-1738; R. Nielsen, Comput. Geosci. 18 (1992) 773-788] underestimate it. Moreover, since none of these models takes into account any pressure effect, the discrepancies between predicted and observed D(Sr) increase with pressure for all models. The new results also show that D(Cr) (opx/liq) increases significantly with pressure: D(Cr) = 2 at 1 atm and 14.2 at 10 kbar. These new data confirm earlier, less precise determinations of D(Cr) that were used to infer a high-pressure origin for Al- and Cr-rich orthopyroxene megacrysts. The calculated Sr and Cr concentrations of liquids in equilibrium at 10 kbar with plagioclase and orthopyroxene megacrysts from anorthosite massifs (Sr = 370 to 610 ppm and Cr = 20 to 130 ppm) are in the range of what is observed in high-Al gabbros and primitive jotunites, the inferred parent magmas of massive anorthosites.

        "Absrtact": "Twenty-nine new high precision U-Pb perovskite ages for kimberlite and other CO2-rich ultrabasic rocks, primarily from five fields or clusters in eastern North America (Rankin Inlet, Attawapiskat, Kirkland Lake, Timiskaming and Finger Lakes), indicate that at least five periods of Mesozoic kimberlite magmatism can be distinguished. These new data document four periods of kimberlite magmatism previously unrecognized in eastern North America: at 196, 180-176, 148-146 and 142-134 Ma. In addition, the detailed emplacement history of Jurassic kimberlites in the Kirkland Lake field indicates magmatism spanned a period of 13 Myr from 165 to 152 Ma with approximately half of the kimberlites in this field emplaced in less than 2 Myr between 156.9-155.3 Ma. These U-Pb results demonstrate for the first time that there is a NW-SE Triassic to Cretaceous age progression in kimberlite magmatism, which is consistent with the relative plate motions of North America during this interval. This age progression in kimberlite magmatism extends for more than 2000 km from Rankin Inlet through to the Attawapiskat, Kirkland Lake and Timiskaming fields and is interpreted, in part, to be the continental expression of magmatism linked to the Great Meteor mantle plume hotspot track. If correct, then the timing and location of this magmatism provides a more rigid constraint for both the exact position of the hotspot and the relative direction and rate of North American plate motion during the Mesozoic opening of the North Atlantic Ocean.

Procedures to process such data and several illustrations of their utilization for summer afternoon meteorological conditions are provided. The constraints involved with the utilization of radiosonde data are discussed. Coastal and continental locations in the US, as represented by San Diego and Oklahoma City radiosondes, were considered for illustration. In San Diego, a significant decrease with height in air temperature, specific humidity and, consequently, ventilation load are typical. These characteristics are suggested to be typical for near shore areas of California. For Oklahoma City, air temperature typically decreased moderately with height. Specific humidity frequently increases, resulting in a mild dependence of the specific moist enthalpy on height.",

        "Absrtact": "Any change in climate will have implications for climate-sensitive systems such as agriculture, forestry, and some other natural resources. With respect to agriculture, changes in solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation will produce changes in crop yields, crop mix, cropping systems, scheduling of field operations, grain moisture content at harvest, and hence, on the economics of agriculture including changes in farm profitability. Such issues are addressed for 10 representative agricultural areas across the midwestern Great Lakes region, a five-state area including Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This region is one of the most productive and important agricultural regions in the world, with over 61% of the land use devoted to agriculture. Individual crop growth processes are affected differently by climate change. A seasonal rise in temperature will increase the developmental rate of the crop, resulting in an earlier harvest. Heat stress may result in negative effects on crop production. Conversely, increased rainfall in drier areas may allow the photosynthetic rate of the crop to increase, resulting in higher yields. Properly validated crop simulation models can be used to combine the environmental effects on crop physiological processes and to evaluate the consequences of such influences. With existing hybrids, an overall pattern of decreasing crop production under scenarios of climate change was found, due primarily to intense heat during the main growth period. However, the results changed with the hybrid of maize (Zea mays L.) being grown and the specific location in the study region. In general, crops grown in sites in northern states had increased yields under climate change, with those grown in sites in the southern states of the region having decreased yields under climate change. Yields from long-season maize increased significantly in the northern part of the study region under future climate change. Across the study region, long-season maize performed most successfully under future climate scenarios compared to current yields, followed by medium-season and then short-season varieties. This analysis highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to changed environmental conditions. In addition, scenarios of increased climate variability produced diverse yields on a year-to-year basis and had increased risk of a low yield. Results indicate that potential future adaptations to climate change for maize yields would require either increased tolerance of maximum summer temperatures in existing maize varieties or a change in the maize varieties grown.

Fortunately, alternate forms of data can be used to improve characterization of spatial variability. We utilize a methodology that augments sparse hydraulic information (hard data) with more widely available hydrogeologic information to generate equiprobable maps of hydrogeologic properties that incorporate patterns of connected permeable zones. Geophysical and lithologic logs are used to identify hydrogeologic categories and to condition stochastic simulations using Sequential Indicator Simulation (SIS). The resulting maps are populated with hydraulic conductivity values using field data and Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS). Maps of subsurface hydrogeologic heterogeneity are generated for the purpose of examining groundwater flow and transport processes at the Faultless underground nuclear test, Central Nevada Test Area (CNTA), through large-scale, three-dimensional numerical modeling. The maps provide the basis for simulation of groundwater flow, while transport of radionuclides from the nuclear cavity is modeled using particle tracking methods. Sensitivity analyses focus on model parameters that are most likely to reduce the long travel times observed in the base case. The methods employed in this study have improved our understanding of the spatial distribution of preferential flowpaths at this site and provided the critical foundation on which to build models of groundwater flow and transport. The results emphasize that the impacts of uncertainty in hydraulic and chemical parameters are dependent on the radioactive decay of specific species, with rapid decay magnifying the effects of parameters that change travel time.

        "Absrtact": "Basin-scale variations in oceanic physical variables are thought to organize patterns of biological response across the Pacific Ocean over decadal time scales. Different physical mechanisms can be responsible for the diverse basin-scale patterns of sea-surface temperature (SST), mixed-layer depth, thermocline depth, and horizontal currents, although they are linked in various ways. In light of various theories and observations, we interpret observed basinwide patterns of decadal-scale variations in upper-ocean temperatures. Evidence so far indicates that large-scale perturbations of the Aleutian Low generate temperature anomalies in the central and eastern North Pacific through the combined action of net surface heat flux, turbulent mixing and Ekman advection. The surface-forced temperature anomalies in the central North Pacific subduct and propagate southwestwards in the ocean thermocline to the subtropics but apparently do not reach the equator. The large-scale Ekman pumping resulting from changes of the Aleutian Low forces western-intensified thermocline depth anomalies that are approximately consistent with Sverdrup theory. These thermocline changes are associated with SST anomalies in the Kuroshio/Oyashio Extension that are of the same sign as those in the central North Pacific, but lagged by several years. The physics of the possible feedback from the SST anomalies to the Aleutian Low, which might close a coupled ocean-atmosphere mode of decadal variability, is poorly understood and is an area of active research. The possible responses of North Pacific Ocean ecosystems to these complicated physical patterns is summarized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Multilocus genotypes from two ethnic human populations, African American (n = 195) and U.S. Caucasian (n = 200), were compiled at 13 STR loci that are used worldwide in forensic investigation (D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D16S539, TH01, TPOX, CSF1PO, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820). Sex-specific AmpFlSTR(TM) multiplexes provided stringent PCR-based STR typing specifically optimized for multicolor fluorescence detection. Heterozygosity at each STR locus ranged from 0.57 to 0.89 and encompassed from seven (TH01) to twenty-one (D21S11) alleles. Homozygosity tests, tests based on the distinct numbers of observed homozygous and heterozygous classes, log likelihood ratio tests, and exact tests assessed that the degree of divergence from theoretical Hardy-Weinberg proportions for all 13 STRs does not have practical consequence in genotype frequency estimation. Departures from linkage equilibrium, between loci, that imposed significance to forensic calculations were not indicated by observed variance of the number of heterozygous loci or Karlin interclass correlation tests. For forensic casework, reliable multilocus profile estimates may be obtained from the product of component genotype frequencies, each calculated through application of the Hardy-Weinberg equation to population database allele frequency estimates reported here. The average probability that two randomly selected, unrelated individuals possess an identical thirteen-locus DNA profile was one in 1.8 x 1015 African Americans and one in 3.8 x 1014 U.S. Caucasians.

        "Absrtact": "Deformation throughout Afar over the past 2 myr has been characterized by widespread and intense crustal fragmentation that results from inhomogeneous extension across the region. In eastern Afar, this situation has evolved to localized extension associated with the westward propagation of the Gulf of Aden/Gulf of Tadjurah seafloor spreading system into the Asal-Ghoubbet Rift. During the gradual process of rift propagation and localization, crustal blocks in eastern Afar sustained clockwise rotations of ~ 11\u00b0. To better understand the processes of rift propagation and localization and how they affect the rest of Afar, we have collected and analyzed over 400 oriented paleomagnetic samples from 67 lava flows from central and southern Afar. Unlike eastern Afar, the mean paleomagnetic direction from central Afar indicates that vertical-axis rotations are statistically insignificant (3.6\u00b0\u00b1 4.4\u00b0), though small clockwise rotations. (<8\u00b0) are permitted. Thus, propagation and localization in central Afar have not had the same influence in causing crustal block rotations or, perhaps more likely, have not reached the same stage of evolution as seen in eastern Afar. In addition, several of the lava flows record intriguing geomagnetic field behavior associated with polarity transitions, excursions, or large secular variation events. Interestingly, the transitional or anomalous virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) tend to cluster in two nearly antipodal regions, one in the northern Pacific Ocean and the other in the southwest Indian Ocean. One lava flow has recorded both of the antipodal transitional components, with the two components residing in magnetic minerals with unblocking temperatures above and below ~ 500\u00b0C, respectively. Reheating and partial remagnetization by the overlying flow cannot explain either of the transitional directions because both differ significantly from that of the reversely magnetized overlying flow. The high-temperature component gives a VGP in the northern Pacific, whereas the lower-temperature component gives a nearly antipodal VGP south of Cape Town, South Africa. Hence, the configuration of the geomagnetic field appears to have jumped nearly instantaneously from a northern-hemisphere transitional state to a southern-hemisphere one during this normal-to-reverse polarity transition.

        "Absrtact": "Integrated geophysical surveys were performed in two sites, Fossa di Fuardo and Terme di San Calogero in Lipari Island, Southern Italy with the intent of the exploration of low-enthalpy geothermal fluids. Both sites show strong geochemical and geologic evidences of hydrothermal activity. The geophysical methods consist of two microgravimetric surveys, two 2D geoelectric profiles, a seismic reflection profile and a five seismic refraction profiles. The seismic methods allowed us to locate the main subsurface seismic discontinuities and to evaluate their geometrical relationships. The gravity field was used to constraint the seismic discontinuities, while the electric prospecting let discriminate more conductive areas, which could correspond to an increase in thermal fluid circulation in the investigated sites. The results obtained by the different geophysical methods are in good agreement and permit the definition of a reliable geostructural model of the subsurface setting of the two investigated areas. A low-enthalpy geothermal reservoir constituted by a permeable pyroclastic and lava sequence underlying two shallow impermeable formations was found at Fossa del Fuardo. The reservoir is intersected by some sub-vertical faults/fractures that probably play an important role in convoying the thermal water up to the surface. At the other site, Terme di S. Calogero, the geophysical surveys showed that an intense circulation of fluids affects the subsurface of the area. This circulation concentrates along a ENE-trending fault located at a little distance from the thermal resort. The hot fluids may upraise along the fault if the width of the ascent area is smaller than 20 m. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The magnetostratigraphic time scale provides a record of the occurrence of geomagnetic reversals. The temporal distribution of reversals may be modelled as the realization of an inhomogeneous renewal process; i.e., one in which the intensity, \u03bb(t), or reversal rate is a function of time. Variations in reversal rate occurring on time scales of tens of millions of years are believed to reflect changes in core-mantle boundary conditions influencing the structure of core flow and the field produced by the geodynamo. We present a new estimate for reversal rate variations as a function of time using nonparametric adaptive kernel density estimation and discuss the difficulties in making inferences on the basis of such estimates. Using a technique proposed by Hengartner and Stark (1992a; b; 1995), it is possible to compute confidence bounds on the temporal probability density function for geomagnetic reversals. The method allows the computation of a lower bound on the number of modes required by the observations, thus enabling a test of whether 'bumps' are required features of the reversal rate function. Conservative 95% confidence intervals can then be calculated for the temporal location of a single mode or antimode of the probability density function. Using observations from time interval 0-158 Ma, it is found that the derivative of the rate function must have changed sign at least once. The timing of this sign change is constrained to be between 152.56 and 22.46 Ma at the 95% confidence level. Confidence bounds are computed for the reversal rate under the assumption that the observed reversals are a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson or other renewal process with an arbitrary monotonically increasing rate function from the end of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS) to the present, a zero rate during the CNS, and a monotonically decreasing rate function from M29R at 158 Ma to the onset of the CNS. It is unnecessary to invoke more than one sign change in the derivative of the rate function to fit the observations. There is no incompatibility between our results and a recent assertion that there is an asymmetry in average reversal rate prior to and after the CNS, when the CNS is assumed to be a period of zero reversal rate. Neither can we use our results to reject an alternative hypothesis that rates are essentially constant from 158 to 130 Ma, and from 25 Ma to the present, with an intermediate nonstationary segment.

        "Absrtact": "This paper is devoted to a new approach to the problem of estimating the free core nutation (FCN) parameters from tidal gravity data. We first review different models of the FCN resonance parameters (period, damping, strength), as well as different inversion techniques used in gravimetry (analytical, linearised least squares, non-linear generalised inverse, stochastic). We propose then a new Bayesian inversion method since such a probabilistic view allows the most complete and reliable information on the FCN resonance to be obtained. We show the consequences of introducing the positivity of the quality factor Q and, even more important, we show that the null information criterion on this factor allows us to better understand why Q is often underestimated in gravity studies (or even found to be negative) with standard least squares techniques. We apply the Bayesian estimation method to a set of gravity data originating from a 3000-day record (1988-1996) of the superconducting gravimeter (SG T005) near Strasbourg (France), after correction for pressure effects and ocean loading with the help of a recent model derived from satellite altimetry. The marginal distribution found for the eigenperiod is nearly Gaussian and leads to a most probable value of 428 days, in agreement with previous gravity studies. The Q distribution is found to be highly asymmetrical with a flat maximum probability that Q exceeds 105, in agreement with the high values derived from very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) studies. The joint probability laws of the parameters show that strong correlations exist between some couples of parameters. Finally, the important impact of inaccurate ocean loading corrections on the determination of the damping of the eigenmode is pointed out; it appears that wrong ocean corrections may lead to underestimation of Q or, even worse, to generation of negative Q when using standard least squares retrieval techniques applied to gravity data.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: The present study modeled data from a large series of experiments originally designed to investigate the influence of time, dose, and fractionation on early and late pathologic endpoints in rat small intestine after localized irradiation. The objective was to obtain satisfactory descriptions of the regenerative response to injury together with the possible relationships between early and late endpoints. Methods: Two- and 26-week pathologic radiation injury data in groups of Sprague-Dawley rats irradiated with 27 different fractionation schedules were modeled using the incomplete repair (IR) version of the linear-quadratic model with or without various time correction models. The following time correction models were tested: (1) No time correction; (2) A simple exponential (SE) regenerative response beginning at an arbitrary time after starting treatment; and (3) A bi-exponential response with its commencement linked to accumulated cellular depletion and fraction size (the 'intelligent response model' [INTR]). Goodness of fit of the various models was assessed by correlating the predicted biological effective dose for each dose group with the observed radiation injury score. Results: (1) The incomplete repair model without time correction did not provide a satisfactory description of either the 2- or 26-week data. (2) The models using SE time correction performed better, providing modest descriptions of the data. (3) The INTR model provided reasonable descriptions of both the 2- and 26-week data, confirming a treatment time dependence of both early and late pathological endpoints. (4) The most satisfactory descriptions of the data by the INTR model were obtained when the regenerative response was assumed to cease 2 weeks after irradiation rather than at the end of irradiation. A fraction-size-dependent delay of the regenerative response was also suggested in the best fitting models. (5) Late endpoints were associated with low-fractionation sensitivity and treatment-time dependence even in animal groups that exhibited minimal early mucosal reactions. Conclusion: Radiation injury scores in this rat small intestinal experimental model cannot be adequately described without time correction. 'Consequential' mechanisms contribute to the development of late effects, even in animals that do not develop severe early mucosal injuries. The initiation of the regenerative response is subject to a fraction-size-dependent mitotic delay and is linked to the level of accumulated cellular depletion. The response does not cease at the end of therapy but probably continues until maximal healing has taken place. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "Plant communities (ground and field layer species) within a wide range of coniferous forest stands across Britain were classified using the National Vegetation Classification, and community composition and diversity related to stand structure and site characteristics. Data were collected from 12 plantation forest sites, encompassing a range of climatic conditions (uplands, foothills, and lowlands), crop types (Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Corsican pine), and crop ages (pre-thicket, mid-rotation, mature and over-mature). Vegetation communities in lowland sites were poorly correlated with semi-natural woodland analogues, with 'goodness-of-fit' coefficients less than 40%. The highest coefficients were obtained for mature and over-mature pine and spruce stands in the uplands and foothills climatic zones. These stands were matched most closely to semi-natural pinewoods and oakwood communities. Principal components analysis produced four summary soil vectors and four habitat structure vectors, that described 84 and 79% of the variability in the site and stand structure data, respectively. These vectors were related to plant community composition, species richness and diversity using canonical correspondence analysis and correlation analysis. Variation in community composition was related principally to a soil fertility gradient, defined by increasing pH, exchangeable Ca, and available N in NO3- form, coupled with decreases in soil organic matter and N in NH4+ form. Vascular plant and bryophyte species diversity was inversely related to available N. Uplands and foothills Scots pine and Sitka spruce sites had plant communities typical of acid, infertile soils, whereas lowland Norway spruce sites had communities associated with high soil fertility. Plant community composition and diversity was also significantly related to measures of vertical stand structure. Pre-thicket plots, with high values for field layer vertical cover; had distinctive communities and were more diverse than mid-rotation and mature plots; which had high canopy cover values, and low shrub and field layer cover. A positive relationship was recorded between deadwood volume and bryophyte species diversity, with over-mature Sitka spruce stands in the uplands having particularly high volumes of deadwood due to windthrow. This influence of stand structure suggests that plant community diversity can be enhanced in commercial conifer forests by extending rotation lengths, introducing alternative silvicultural systems such as shelterwood, and increasing deadwood volumes.

        "Absrtact": "We have used wide-angle seismic data to constrain the internal structure of Tenerife, Canary Islands. The experiment was designed as a seismic fan profile to detect azimuthal variations in the seismic structure of the volcanic edifice and its flanks. Seismic energy was generated using a 75-1 airgun-array on board the RRS Charles Darwin fired every 40 s along a quasi-circular profile around the island of Tenerife, centered on Teide volcano. We present the results obtained from the data recorded by five portable land stations distributed on the island. The travel-times indicate that the averaged P-wave velocity within the volcanic edifice is greater than 6 km/s. The observed travel-times were reduced to residual travel-times by removing the effects of variations in the bathymetry along the profile, variations in the shot-receiver distance, and from local heterogeneities. Negative residual travel-times up to 0.8 s in amplitude indicate that the southwestern part of Tenerife is characterized by a high P-wave velocity zone, coincident with a gravity maximum that was previously modeled as a high-density body forming the core of an old, large mafic volcano. We estimate velocities greater than 7.3 km/s within the anomalous body, suggesting that it represents an intrusive plutonic complex. This high-velocity, high-density body may have played an important role in the evolution of Tenerife, buttressing Las Ca\u00f1adas edifice and preventing the occurrence of landslides in the southern and western areas of Tenerife. The bathymetric high between Tenerife and La Gomera is associated with travel-time delays up to 0.4 s, suggesting that it may be composed of large deposits of lava flows and volcaniclastic materials, probably erupted from the shield massifs of Teno, Roque del Conde, and La Gomera. The post-shield volcanic zones of Santiago and Dorsal rifts also seem to be characterized by moderate high P-wave velocities. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Soil erosion continues to be a major concern for the development of sustainable agricultural management systems. Sustainability modelling analysis for soil erosion must include not only vulnerability prediction but also address impact and response assessment, in an integrated way. This paper focuses on the impact of soil erosion on crop productivity and the accommodation of agricultural use and management practices to soil protection. From the Andalucia region in Spain, soil/slope, climate and crop/management information was used to further develop an expert-system/neural-network soil erosion predicting model (named Impe1ERO). Based on soil tolerance to water erosion, three regression equations were formulated to examine the effects of soil depth loss on crop productivity reduction. Also, a computerised procedure was developed to find a combination of management practices which would minimise soil loss in each field-unit. The overall approach of Impe1ERO was applied in 20 selected benchmark sites from western Europe to quantify the soil erosion vulnerability with several crops, the impact of soil erosion on crop production, and the optimum management strategies. In the Mediterranean sites, soil losses reach an average of almost 50 Mg ha-1 per year, the potential impact of soil erosion on the crop productivity was very important (up to 48% reduction in the 2050 time horizon), and the farming practices can be widely modified to protect environmental qualities. The results of this benchmark site analysis of soil erosion, however, must not be extrapolated to large geographical areas without additional spatialisation studies. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

After removal of a low-coercivity drilling overprint the sediments display a stable, single-component remanent magnetization. Two short cores that recovered the uppermost 2.6 m of sediment have inclinations that fluctuate about the present day inclination (-57\u00b0) measured at Faraday Station, and several features with wavelengths of 10 to 20 cm appear to be correlative. However, shipboard measurements of inclination fluctuations on split-core samples from three holes drilled at ODP Site 1098 do not correlate well with each other, even though the intensity and susceptibility data correlate very well and the overall mean inclination for cores from each hole is consistent with the expected geocentric axial dipole (GAD) inclination. The correlation is improved dramatically by using inclinations measured on u-channels taken from the pristine center of a split core. Consequently, the anomalous directions and the resulting poor between-hole correlation of inclinations obtained from shipboard data can be attributed to coring-induced deformation, which is common on the outer edge of ODP piston cores, and/or measurement artifacts in the split-core data. Our preferred inclination record is thus derived from u-channel results. The upper ~ 25 m represents continuous sedimentation over the past 9000 yr, with an average sedimentation rate exceeding 250 cm/kyr (0.25 cm/yr). Given that remanence measurements on u-channels average over an interval < 7 cm long, we obtained independent measurements of the paleo-geomagnetic field that average over only ~ 30 yr. This high-resolution record is characterized by an inclination that fluctuates within \u00b1 15\u00b0of the current GAD inclination. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

These species-specific microclimatic parameters are derived from meteorological data provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (DNMI), together with detailed land-use and soil type maps assembled at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). Modelled fluxes are presented as mean monthly flux maps and compared with maps describing equivalent values of AOT40 (accumulated exposure over threshold of 40 ppb or nl l-1), highlighting the spatial differences between these two indices. In many cases high ozone fluxes were modelled in association with only moderate AOT40 values. The factors most important in limiting ozone uptake under the model assumptions were vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil moisture deficit (for Mediterranean regions in particular) and phenology. The limiting effect of VPD on ozone uptake was especially apparent, since high VPDs resulting in stomatal closure tended to co-occur with high ozone concentrations. Although further work is needed to link the ozone uptake and deposition model components, and to validate the model with field measurements, the present results give a clear indication of the possible implications of adopting a flux-based approach for future policy evaluation.

        "Absrtact": "Atmospheric CO2 concentration has greatly fluctuated during the Quaternary. These variations have influenced the vegetation changes. The assumption that the relationship vegetation-climate sensu stricto was constant through time should be reconsidered taking into account the impact of the atmospheric CO2 content on the plants. Here we propose to use a process-based vegetation model (BIOME3) in an inverse mode to reconstruct from pollen data the most probable climate under precipitation seasonality change and under lowered CO2 concentration in the biosphere. Appropriate tools to match the model outputs with the pollen data are developed to generate a probability distribution associated with the reconstruction (Monte Carlo sampling and neural network techniques). The method is validated with modern pollen samples from Greece and Italy: it proves to be able to reconstruct modern climate with a more or less large error bar from pollen data. The error bar depends in fact on the tolerance of the vegetation to the corresponding climatic variable. The application to six pollen assemblages from Greece and Italy, representing the last glacial maximum (LGM: 18 000 14C-year B.P.), is done into three experiments: (1) modern CO2 concentration; (2) LGM CO2 concentration; (3) LGM CO2 concentration and high winter precipitation. The latter experiment is motivated by evidence of high lake-levels in Greece during the LGM which has been attributed to winter rainfall. These experiments show that winter was ca. 15-20\u00b0C colder than the present, in agreement with previous climate reconstruction. The apparent discrepancy between the high lake-levels and the steppe vegetation during the LGM, can be explained by an increase of the winter precipitation (which leads to high lake level) while the summer season is mild and dry (which affects the vegetation). The summer temperature has three stable states (- 16\u00b0C, - 10\u00b0C, - 2\u00b0C), but the warmest one is the most probable if we take into account the lowered CO2 and the high lake-levels.

The interviewer's assessment of the body condition of each cat was the dependent variable used in this study. Variables that were identified as significant (p\u22640.1) following univariable analysis were grouped into one of the three models for stepwise logistic multiple regression (one each for cat characteristics, environmental and management variables and feeding variables). A combined logistic-regression analysis was performed on the significant variables identified from the three component models. In the combined model, only three variables were significant: the presence of dogs in a household (decreased odds of obesity), longer leg length and owners underestimating cats' body condition (both increased odds).

Analyses are based on a cross-sectional research design in which comparisons are made of variations in household travel demand and emissions across alternative urban form typologies. Base emission rates from MOBILE5a and separate engine start rates are used to calculate total vehicle emissions in grams accounting for fleet characteristics and other inputs reflecting adopted transportation control measures.

        "Absrtact": "Decision support systems (DSS) are potentially valuable tools for assessing the economic and ecological impacts of alternative decisions on aquaculture production. In this paper, we discuss the philosophy of design, functional modules and application areas of POND, a decision tool that has been developed to allow analysis of pond aquaculture facilities by the use of a combination of simulation models and enterprise budgeting. We focus less on the details of POND's internal models, and more on the experiences we have gained from going through the process of the designing, developing and using the POND software. POND was designed and implemented using object-oriented programming principles. The software makes use of a simulation framework to provide much of the generic simulation, data handling, time flow synchronization and communication features necessary for complex model-based DSSs. Additionally, an architecture suitable for representing and manipulating pond aquaculture facilities was developed in order to meet the design specifications of POND. This architecture includes a series of mini-databases, a number of knowledge-based components ('experts'), models of the pond ecosystem, and various decision support features (e.g. assembling alternate management scenarios, economic analysis, and data visualization). A typical POND simulation consists of assembling a number of appropriate objects or entities (e.g. multiple ponds and fish lots), their management settings together with appropriate experts (e.g. an aquaculture engineer, an aquatic biologist, an economist, etc.), and projecting changes in the facility over time. Our experience with the development of POND and other simulation-based tools indicates that the object-based approach provides a robust foundation for developing tools which allow code reusability, facilitate maintenance of complex software, and enable partition of program development among multiple programmers. Experience gained with POND users suggests that there are largely two groups of aquaculture personnel interested in such applications, namely commercial growers and educators. These two groups have substantially different interests and needs. Consequently, a single tool such as POND may not optimally meet the requirements of both groups. Recent development work on POND, and the need to involve users in the design process of such tools are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The algorithm requires neither stereo recordings of speech during training nor manual labeling of handset types either in training or testing. Results on the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Speaker Recognition Evaluation corpus show relative improvements as high as 28% for the new multilayered perceptron (MLP)-based features as compared to a standard mel-cepstral feature set with cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) and handset-dependent normalizing impostor models.",

A high-affinity binding site for the spliceosomal protein U1A was engineered into a segment of the catalytic RNA that is dispensable for catalysis. Because molecular surfaces of proteins are more chemically varied than those of RNA, the presence of the protein moiety was expected to facilitate crystallization and improve crystal order. The HDV ribozyme-U1A complex crystallized readily, and its structure was solved using standard techniques for heavy-atom derivatization of protein crystals. Over 1200 \u00c52 of the solvent-accessible surface area of the complex are involved in crystal contacts. As protein-protein interactions comprise 85% of this buried area, these crystals appear to be held together predominantly by the protein component of the complex. Our crystallization method should be useful for the structure determination of other biochemically important RNAs for which protein partners do not exist or are experimentally intractable. The refined model of the complex (R-free = 27.9% for all reflections between 20.0 and 2.3 \u00c5) reveals an RNA with a deep active site cleft. Well-ordered metal ions are not observed crystallographically in this cavity. Biochemical results of previous workers had suggested an important role in catalysis for cytosine 75. The pyrimidine base of this residue is buried at the bottom of the active site in an environment that could raise its pK(a) value. We propose that this highly conserved cytosine may be the general base that catalyzes the transesterification. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

Muriwai is a high-energy meso-tidal beach characterised by modal breaker wave heights of 2.5 m and incident wave periods of 10-15 s. The monitored rip system was characterised by a 400 m long, 75 m wide longshore feeder channel and a 150 m wide rip-neck channel oriented obliquely to the shore and extending over a distance of almost 400 m. During the experiment, the beach evolved from a longshore bar-trough and rip state to a transverse bar and rip configuration. Mean eulerian flow velocities obtained from ducted flowmeters deployed on the margin of the feeder channel and rip-neck were on the order of 1 m s-1 and instantaneous flows were commonly in excess of 2 m s-1. Mean lagrangian surface flow velocities extending from the base of the feeder through to the rip-head were obtained by tracking rip floaters and were on the order of 0.7 m s-1, with maximums in the rip-neck region of 1.4 m s-1. A distinct tidal modulation of rip current flow existed with maximum velocities occurring at low tide and minimum velocities at high tide. Comparison with other rip studies suggests that although the magnitude of the morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes occurring within large-scale rip systems is extreme, the behaviour of these rip systems is very similar to low-energy rips with much smaller spatial scales. There is evidence to suggest that distinct morphodynamic scaling relationships exist between these environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Adjusted estimates of pair-wise cross-product ratios (PWCPR), a measure of clustering, show modest clustering (i.e. PWCPR>1.0) at the school level for tobacco smoking (PWCPR=1.41; 95% confidence interval, CI=1.22-1.64), alcohol consumption (PWCPR=1.33; 95% CI=1.22-1.45), use of inhalants, (PWCPR=1.35; 95%CI=1.07-1.69), and other drug use (PWCPR=1.38; 95%CI=1.14-1.68). These findings provide preliminary evidence that the odds of drug use among school-attending youths increase when another youth in the same school uses drugs, and suggest a new line of research on within-school diffusion that should include the identification of school-level factors that contribute to student drug use.

To compare correlates of enduring and phasic negative symptoms, we studied 60 drug-free schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R and SADS/RDC) at baseline, 4 weeks after neuroleptic treatment, and assessed the 1 year outcome. We rated positive and negative symptoms at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment. At baseline, premorbid function, neuropsychological function, ventricle-brain ratio (VBR) and symptom response to an anticholinergic agent were assessed, and a two-night sleep EEG and 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) were conducted. Phasic negative symptoms were defined as the change in negative symptoms (baseline to 4 weeks) and enduring negative symptoms as severity of negative symptoms at 4 weeks. Patients had varying proportions of phasic and enduring symptoms; the two did not define distinct subgroups. Phasic negative symptoms were significantly correlated with global treatment response, positive symptom treatment response, response to anticholinergic agent, baseline post-dexamethasone cortisol, and shortened REM latency. Enduring negative symptoms were significantly correlated with residual positive symptoms and global psychopathology, VBR, poor performance on neuropsychological testing, decreased slow-wave sleep, poor premorbid function, and poor 1 year outcome. These data suggest that phasic negative symptoms and enduring negative symptoms may be caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Deamplification of strong motion and the increase of the effective period of soil deposits are typical nonlinear effects: we seek them in SMART 1-array data by applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) technique. The recordings, from four soil and one rock stations, represent 23 earthquakes (ML 4.9-7.0): PGA varies between 20-260 cm/s2. For each station, mean HVSR curves are calculated for two PGA ranges: <75 cm/s2 and >100 cm/s2 (weak and strong motion). At the soil station, the \"weak\" (linear) and \"strong\" (nonlinear) responses are significantly different. Below 1-1.8 Hz, the nonlinear response exceeds the linear one. Above 2 Hz, the nonlinear response drops below the linear one and above 4-6 Hz below unity (deamplification). From 10 to 16 Hz, the two responses converge. One soil site shows significant negative correlation between resonance frequency and ground acceleration. Such behaviour agrees with other empirical studies and theoretical predictions. Our results imply that the HVSR technique is sensitive to ground-motion intensity and can be used to detect and study nonlinear site response. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The methods do not depend on the local flow patterns at a single point used in many other vortex detection techniques. Both methods begin by covering the full domain with a large number of streamlines, and select the curves with circular or looping geometry. The first method uses local cumulations of curvature centers which may indicate that many streamlines are circling around a cluster of closely spaced center points. The second method detects looping patterns in streamlines by looking at the cumulative changes of direction, as represented by the winding angle. The second method is very effective in detecting weak vortices, as it does not depend on velocity magnitude but only on the pattern. The methods can be used for quantification of vortices using numerical attributes which are suitable for feature tracking in time dependent flows. We present results of the methods with stationary and time-dependent CFD data sets.",

        "Absrtact": "Dissociation between copying letters and writing to dictation has been reported in the clinical neuropsychological literature. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted in normal volunteers to detect the neurofunctional differences between 'copying Kanji', the Japanese ideographic characters, and 'writing Kanji corresponding to phonological information'. Four tasks were conducted: the copying-Kanji task, the writing-Kanji-corresponding-to-phonogram task, the Kanji-grapheme-puzzle task, and the control task. The right superior parietal lobule was extensively activated during the copying-Kanji task (a model of the copying letters process) and the Kanji-grapheme-puzzle task. These observations suggested that this area was involved in referring the visual stimuli closely related to the ongoing handwriting movements. On the other hand, Broca's area, which is crucial for language production, was extensively activated during the writing-Kanji-corresponding-to-phonogram task (a model of the writing-to-dictation process). The Kanji-grapheme-puzzle task activated the bilateral border portions between the inferior parietal lobule and the occipital lobe, the left premotor area, and the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Since the Kanji-grapheme-puzzle task involved manipulospatial characteristics, these results suggested cooperation between visuospatial and motor executive functions, which may be extensively utilized in demanding visual language processing. The neurofunctional difference between 'copying Kanji' and 'writing Kanji corresponding to phonogram' was efficiently demonstrated by this fMRI experiment. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The presence of erosive canyons on high latitude passive margins is unusual. Such margins are more normally dominated by subsidence and glacially influenced deposition. However, ten canyons are identified at the edge of the narrow shelf on the North Norwegian margin off the Lofoten Islands, between the Traenadjupet and Andoya slides, on the basis of GLORIA long-range side-scan sonar and contemporaneous 3.5 kHz profiler data, combined with a detailed bathymetry. The canyons are located down-stream of sediments transported through the Lofoten Drift, and the margin is characterized by an absence of cross-shelf troughs. Canyons are up to 420 m deep, U-shaped, display steep gradients in their upper parts, and sediments derived from them have short runout distances onto the continental rise. The canyons are estimated to be 20-30 Ma old, being incised into only thinly covered, lithified, pre-Miocene sediments as a response to Cenozoic uplift. Late Quaternary sedimentation processes associated with the canyons are inferred to occur during both glacials and interglacials. Glacial sedimentation is probably in the form of direct subglacial-debris input, in addition to turbid subglacial meltwater plumes. Interglacial sedimentation processes are probably dominated by the along-shelf transport of sediments by strong ocean currents; canyon heads 'capture' sediment from the shelf. The remobilization of this coarse material and erosion of the canyons occurs through debris flows and turbidity currents. Canyon preservation and continued development can be attributed directly to the comparatively low sedimentation rates during full-glacial conditions, as ice streams, located to the north and south, produce regional depocentres away from this area of relatively slow-flowing ice.

This type of information can be integrated with regional seismotectonic analysis in order to asses the present-day conditions of deformation characterising the area, and to constrain the possible kinematics of the seismogenic structures controlling earthquake activity in this sector of the southern Apennines. The results of our study are also of interest for modelling earthquake sources, since a knowledge of the permeability structure and scaling properties of a faulted rock volume is potentially relevant for simulating the time and space dependent behaviour of fault zones during a seismic cycle.",

Review articles and collaboration with external experts also play a role along with the use of secondary databases like PROSITE and Pfam in addition to a variety of feature prediction methods. Annotation added by these methods is checked for relevance and likelihood to a particular sequence. The onset of genome sequencing has led to a dramatic increase in sequence data to be included in SWISS-PROT. This has led to the production of TrEMBL (Translation of the EMBL database). TrEMBL consists of entries in a SWISS-PROT format that are derived from the translation of all coding sequences in the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, that are not in SWISS-PROT. Unlike SWISS-PROT entries those in TrEMBL are awaiting manual annotation. However, rather than just representing basic sequence and source information, steps have been taken to add features and annotation automatically. In taking these steps it is hoped that TrEMBL entries are enhanced with some indication as to what a protein is, could or may be. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Assuming a structural/functional correlation in the motor system we tested whether asymmetries in hand performance in consistent right and left handers as well as in mixed handers are associated with anatomical asymmetries in the motor cortex. In vivo MR morphometry was used for analyzing interhemispheric asymmetry in the depth of the central sulcus in the region of cortical hand representation of 103 healthy subjects. Subjects were tested both for hand preference and hand performance. As expected, left-right differences in hand performance differed significantly between consistent right, consistent left and mixed handers and were independent on gender. Male consistent right handers showed a significant deeper central sulcus on the left hemisphere than on the right. Anatomical asymmetries decreased significantly from male consistent right over mixed to consistent left handers. Sixty two per cent of consistent left handers revealed a deeper central sulcus on the right than on the left hemisphere, but for the group as a whole this rightward asymmetry was not significant. No interhemispheric asymmetry was found in females. Thus, anatomical asymmetry was associated with handedness only in males, but not in females, suggesting sex differences in the cortical organization of hand movements.

Temperature reductions were imposed only while the plants were under black cloth using a combination of air-conditioning and under-cloth ventilation. The two heat-sensitive cultivars tested were 'Yellow Mandalay' and 'Coral Charm' and the two heat-tolerant cultivars were 'Iridon' and 'Dark Bronze Charm'. Differences in time-to-flower (TTF) between heat tolerance classifications were less than anticipated. TTF was affected the most in 'Iridon', a heat-tolerant cultivar, decreasing by an average of 4.2 days/\u00b0C as mean diurnal temperatures (MT) decreased from about 26\u00b0C to about 23\u00b0C. TTF was affected the least in 'Coral Charm', a heat-sensitive cultivar, decreasing by an average of 2.8 days/\u00b0C over the same range. Inflorescence diameter, on the other hand, increased by as much as 9% in the two heat-sensitive cultivars but by only about 4% in the heat-tolerant cultivars. The results suggest that the heat-tolerant cultivars tested here may have been classified based on consistency of flower quality rather than TTF. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The assimilated mean sea level is based on the model simulation, but modified in the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream based on a dynamic sea level from climatological hydrographic data. Sea level updates are accompanied by vertical thermocline displacement and geostrophic current adjustments away from the equator. Sea level errors were used to weight the sea level updates, with the model forecast errors calculated at low spatial resolution using an adaptive method based on the work of Dee [Dee, D.P., 1995. On-line estimation of error covariance parameters for atmospheric data assimilation, Mon. Wea. Rev. 123, pp. 1128 - 1145]. The modified mean sea levels are very successful at deflecting the western boundary currents to more realistic separation points which results in better surface temperature fronts and diagnosed air-sea heat fluxes, based on temperature relaxation. The altimeter anomalies are successfully assimilated and the model is able to propagate these between assimilation times, although with some degradation and damping of the smaller scale features. Predictions of sea level changes over 10-, 20- and 40-day periods are better than the corresponding persistence forecasts except for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current area where there is little difference. AVHRR and subsurface hydrographic and ADCP current data from WOCE cruises were used for validation, and the model run with altimeter assimilation shows significantly better agreement with these independent data sets than the model simulation, for all areas away from the equator.

        "Absrtact": "We report solution-ICPMS analyses of Rb, Ba, Th, U, Nb, Ta, REE, Sr, Zr and Hf for acid-leached minerals of anhydrous spinel peridotites and websterites from the Ronda peridotite (S. Spain). The same elements were also analyzed by LA-ICPMS in the silicates of three peridotites. The results obtained by solution-ICPMS and LA-ICPMS are similar for the less (HREE) and the most incompatible (Rb-Ba) elements, and provide comparable inter-element distribution coefficients (D(xt/cpx)) for these elements. However, moderately incompatible elements (typically LREE) show significant discrepancies between solution and in situ analyses. D(opx/cpx) and D(ol/cpx) for these elements are generally lower for solution than for in situ analyses. D(xt/cpx) for MREE, HREE, Zr and Hf are consistent with experimental values. In contrast, D(xt/cpx) for highly incompatible elements and LREE are higher than expected from available experimental data and/or crystal-chemical considerations. The observed D(xt/cpx) for the most incompatible trace elements may be explained by very small amounts of melt/fluid, or solid, inclusions trapped in these minerals. Inclusions would affect both solution- and LA-ICPMS data, but their proportion would be less important for LA-ICPMS analyses. We show with a mixing model that an extremely small amount of equilibrium partial melt (typically 0.01-0.1%) trapped in minerals is sufficient to increase the D(opx/cpx) for HIE and LREE by a factor of 5-20 and the D(ol/cpx) by two or three orders of magnitude. Similar effects may be produced by sub-percent amounts of HIE-rich fluids of solid microphases. Such very small volumes of inclusions may pass unnoticed during mineral handpicking and LA-ICPMS analysis. Hence, D(xt/cpx) for HIE and LREE should be considered cautiously when mineral analyses are used to constrain melt processes and mantle composition. Mass balance calculations were performed for a nominally anhydrous spinel harzburgite sample. Similar to previous studies, the mass balance indicates important discrepancies for HIE between peridotite composition reconstructed from mineral analyses (bulk and in situ) and whole rock composition. The major silicate minerals are the main repositories for REE, Zr and Hf (> 75% of the whole rock budget), and also host \u226565% of Th and U. In contrast, more than 80% of the budget of Rb, Ba and Nb, and about 60% of Ta and Sr, is hosted by micro-components in grain boundaries (GBC) or trapped in minerals (inclusions). Alone, the GBC accounts for 50% of the budget of Nb and Ta. The inclusions are an important repository for Rb (39%), Nb (40%) and Sr (49%). The GBC and inclusion repositories display very similar trace element signatures, suggesting that they were once a single repository (< 1 wt%) now re-distributed in different textural components. This repository could be a combination of hydrous phases and/or Ti oxides, and/or melt/fluid inclusions of mantle origin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Neutron diffraction studies may be used to investigate the modifications to the local molecular environment. It is found that the hydrogen bonding is enhanced in the confined state and the nucleation temperature is depressed. The diffraction studies show that there is a systematic variation in the structure factor, which is similar to that of the bulk phase but shifted in temperature. The behaviour at low temperatures is due to the formation of an extended hydrogen-bonded network similar to that of amorphous ice. The confined liquid eventually nucleates with the formation of a defective form of cubic ice rather than hexagonal ice formed in the bulk phase. The studies have been made primarily for mesoporous silicas but some preliminary results are also given for water in a lamellar liquid crystal. The results have relevance to the behaviour of interfacial water in membranes and biological systems. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

The key feature of market basket choice is the interdependence in demand relationships across the items in the final basket. This research develops a new approach to the specification of market basket models that allows a choice model for a basket of goods to be constructed using a set of \"local\" conditional choice models corresponding to each item in the basket. The approach yields a parsimonious market basket model that allows for any type of demand relationship across product categories (complementarity, independence, or substitution) and can be estimated using simple modifications of standard multinomial logit software. We analyze the choice of four grocery store categories that exhibit common cross-category brand names for both national brands and private labels. Results indicate that cross-category price elasticities are small. We argue that store traffic patterns may be more important than consumer-level demand interdependence in forecasting market basket choice. \u00a9 2000 New York University.",

We explored potential implications of climatic changes on lifeform distribution and growth at Wind Cave National Park (WCNP), South Dakota, which lies on a climatically determined ecotone between grassland and forest. Fire, promoted by healthy grasslands, is a negative feedback limiting tree development because it kills seedlings and consumes live foliage thus reducing tree growth and survival. Historical records show that fire suppression has enhanced forest expansion. On the other hand, livestock grazing reduces grass biomass and fuel loads thus indirectly reducing fire frequency and enhancing the expansion of forests or woodlands. Natural fires and moderate grazing by native herbivores have maintained the coexistence of trees and grasses but climatic variations affecting the area's water resources can lead to dominance by either lifeform. We used a dynamic vegetation model (DVM) MC1 to simulate the interactions between climatic changes, natural fire regime, and grazing pressure and their impact on the biogeographical and biogeochemical characteristics of the park. We used one future climate projection (HADCM2SUL) which simulates warmer weather by the end of the next century: the temperature increase would constrain the growth of trees that rely on the availability of deep water, favor shrub and grass development and promote a shift from forests to woodlands. Woody encroachment of shrubs in grasslands areas, enhanced by grazing, was only held in check by frequent natural fires in the simulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A total of 309 postmenopausal women at five sites underwent baseline coronary angiography and were randomized. Participants will have repeat coronary angiography after an average of 3.25 years of treatment. The primary outcome of interest will be change in minimum diameter of the major epicardial segments, as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that either form of hormone therapy will slow the progression or induce regression of coronary atherosclerosis compared to placebo. The secondary aims are to assess the effects of the two treatments versus placebo on endothelial function (measured using flow-mediated vasodilator responses), on several presumed mediators of estrogen's effect on atherosclerosis (i.e., plasma lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, hemostatic factors, and antioxidant activity), on other factors that influence the development of coronary heart disease (i.e., diet, smoking status, exercise, weight, and health-related quality of life issues), and on clinical cardiovascular events.The ERA trial is the first angiographic endpoint clinical trial to examine the effects of postmenopausal hormone replacement on coronary atherosclerosis in women. It will provide an unparalleled opportunity to determine if either regimen of hormone therapy is effective in slowing the progress of angiographically defined coronary atherosclerosis. This study will complement other estrogen replacement trials, such as the PEPI, HERS, and Women's Health Initiative studies, to provide a more comprehensive examination of the effects of estrogen replacement on cardiovascular risk factors, anatomic and functional manifestations of atherosclerosis, and risk for coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women.

In a recent survey study, Raupach et al. [Raupach, M.R., Finnigan, J.J., Brunet, Y., 1996. Bound.-Layer Meteorol. 78, 351-382] reviewed the current state of knowledge about air flow under ideal conditions (neutral to slightly unstable conditions, homogeneous and extensive canopy, flat terrain). This paper extends the knowledge by employing advances in our understanding of the flow in 'non-ideal' situations. The paper is divided into four topic areas: canopy flow under stable stratification, disturbed flow (forest edge, forest clearing, sparse canopy), canopy flow over complex terrain, and extreme wind events. Discussion of the latter two topics is of limited scope because of the scanty literature. A detailed account is given to the nighttime canopy wave phenomenon, broad patterns of the transitional flow across forest edges, and models of various complexities of the disturbed flows. Both observational and modeling aspects are discussed wherever possible. This synthesis study has identified a number of important questions in need of further research.

The results illustrate how difficult it is to make general statements about risk and how management response has to be 'context sensitive'. Any response must be appropriate to the level of risk, the options for risk reduction and the implications of damage. Mathematical models provide an opportunity for objectively calculating the risks to forests and will in the future allow forest managers to make informed decisions about how best to manage forests in order to minimise these risks.

The ability of the learning system to express spatial relationships allows an improved predictive model to be developed, which is both parsimonious and understandable.

These values could vary by as much as 9\u00b0C due to the interaction between wind and radiation, or to changes in body orientation with respect to both these variables. In the presence of wind, radiative heat gain was reduced, and the interaction was generally more important when wind was perpendicular to the incoming radiation. 3.

        "Absrtact": "A 2-year longitudinal observational study of 15 red deer farms was carried out in New Zealand from March 1992. Both years combined, 3364 adult and 653 yearling hinds were diagnosed pregnant in June by ultrasound scanning and monitored for reproductive success up to weaning. At weaning, pre-rut at approximately 100 days after calving, udders were palpated or observed by the farmer and hinds were categorised as lactating (wet) indicating survival of calf, or not lactating (dry). Farm management practices during calving and early lactation were recorded. Analysis of risk factors associated with progeny survival was done using path analysis (separately for adult and yearling hinds). Adult hinds >3 years old at calving, conceiving before 1 May and having a body-condition score >2 in September had 2.8, 2.4 and 2.9 times significantly higher odds of rearing a calf to weaning than other hinds, respectively. Adult hinds had about 5 times lower odds of rearing a calf to weaning when they were mixed with mature stags during calving. When farmers visited calving paddocks and checked for calving problems, adult hinds had 1.7 times higher odds of rearing a calf to weaning. When the farmer entered calving paddocks at least every second time they observed the hinds, yearling hinds had a twice higher odds of rearing a calf up to weaning. Sunny weather and high maximum temperatures were positively and negatively associated, respectively, with the probability of an adult hind being in lactation at weaning.

        "Absrtact": "Trace element air emissions from pulverized coal combustion facilities are strongly element-dependent. Relatively non-volatile elements such as chromium and manganese are captured with efficiencies comparable to overall particulate capture, whereas more volatile elements such as selenium and arsenic are captured less efficiently than the ash particulate. Such element-specific behavior is a consequence of the partitioning of individual trace elements within the combustion and post-combustion environment, resulting in enrichment of the more volatile compounds in the smallest ash particles, coupled to size-dependent particulate penetration through air pollution control devices. In this paper, a model of trace element emissions that incorporates fundamental laboratory results on trace element partitioning as well as recent field emissions data is developed. Model results and comparison to field data indicate that while the emissions of non-volatile elements such as chromium are currently well predicted by existing database-referenced empirical models, predictions of the emitted concentrations of volatile compounds such as arsenic and selenium can be improved by more than 25% through incorporation of element and size-dependent partitioning and penetration.",

        "Absrtact": "In content-based image retrieval systems, the content of an image such as color, shapes and textures are used to retrieve images that are similar to a query image. Most of the existing work focus on the retrieval effectiveness of using content for retrieval, i.e., study the accuracy (in terms of recall and precision) of using different representations of content. In this paper, we address the issue of retrieval efficiency, i.e., study the speed of retrieval, since a slow system is not useful for large image databases. In particular, we look at using the shape feature as the content of an image, and employ the centroid-radii model to represent the shape feature of objects in an image. This facilitates multi-resolution and similarity retrievals. Furthermore, using the model, the shape of an object can be transformed into a point in a high-dimensional data space. We can thus employ any existing high-dimensional point index as an index to speed up the retrieval of images. We propose a multi-level R-tree index, called the Nested R-trees (NR-trees) and compare its performance with that of the R-tree. Our experimental study shows that NR-trees can reduce the retrieval time significantly compared to R-tree, and facilitate similarity retrieval. We note that our NR-trees can also be used to index high-dimensional point data commonly found in many other applications.",

        "Absrtact": "Habitat restoration encompasses a broad range of activities, emphasizing very different issues, goals, and approaches depending on the operational definition of 'restoration'. This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish 'restoration' efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic - pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived from oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be our focus here. In this review, we examine some of the restoration efforts made in the name of fisheries enhancement, address their effectiveness, and discuss some of the issues associated with realizing the broader goal of ecological restoration. We note the importance of linking success criteria to specific goals and make the case for a greater need in clarifying the ecological functions of shellfish and shellfish habitats. We recognize the limitations of existing datasets and summarize ongoing attempts to address oyster habitat restoration throughout the broad geographic distribution of the American oyster. Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over 'attraction versus production' associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves. The necessity of ecosystem (adaptive) management strategies emerges from this discussion. Finally, this overview supports our contention that shellfish habitat should be included in discussions of essential fish habitats' (or EFH). (C) Elsevier Science B.V.",

The reliability of artefact rejection was 98% for setting changes (n = 382), 96% for probe movement (n = 477) and 98% for low flow artefacts (n = 91), but only 68% for electrocautery (n = 264). These preliminary results are promising, but need careful interpretation: 28% of the MES were not detectable in the distal SV, probably due to a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and anatomical restrictions.

After initial elimination of tracer from the readily exchangeable calcium pools subsequent skeletal calcium turnover maintains and modulates the urine 41Ca content. Uniquely, bone calcium metabolism may then be studied with tracer in near equilibrium with the body's calcium and resorbing calcium directly measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of excreta. Our experiments with 25 41Ca labeled subjects demonstrate excellent diurnal stability and remarkable response to intervention of the urine signal. Thus the tracer method may prove a competitive means of measuring the effects of antiresorptive osteoporosis treatments, for therapy development or even clinical monitoring. Novel studies of long-term skeletal evolution are also possible. We realize that routinely administered short-lived calcium radiotracers contain 41Ca impurities and that thousands of experimental participants have been historically inadvertently 41Ca labeled. The 41Ca urine index might now rapidly further be characterized by contemporary measurements of these one-time subjects, and with their by now thoroughly skeleton-equilibrated tracer they might be ideal participants in other new experiments. We are also investigating 45Ca AMS. It may prove preferable to label the skeleton with this radiotracer already familiar to bioscientists, but new to AMS. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Foresters have always relied on a knowledge of chemical and physical properties of soils to assess capacity of sites to support productive forests. Recently, the need for assessing soil properties has expanded because of growing public interest in determining consequences of management practices on the quality of soil relative to sustainability of forest ecosystem functions in addition to plant productivity. The concept of soil quality includes assessment of soil properties and processes as they relate to ability of soil to function effectively as a component of a healthy ecosystem. Specific functions and subsequent values provided by forest ecosystems are variable and rely on numerous soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes, which can differ across spatial and temporal scales. Choice of a standard set of specific properties as indicators of soil quality can be complex and will vary among forest systems and management objectives. Indices of forest soil quality which incorporate soil chemical, physical, and biological properties will be most readily adopted if they are sensitive to management-induced changes, easily measured, relevant across sites or over time, inexpensive, closely linked to measurement of desired values, and adaptable for specific ecosystems. This paper traces development of the concept of soil quality, explores use of soil chemical and physical properties as determinants of forest soil quality, and presents challenges and opportunities for forest soil scientists to play a relevant role in assessment and advancement of sustainable forest management by developing the concept of soil quality as an indicator of sustainability. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The objectives of the study are to assess the quality of the new terrain-following model in the limit of realistic basin-scale simulations, and to compare the results obtained with it against those of other North Atlantic models used in recent multi-model comparison studies. The new model is able to reproduce many features of both the wind-driven and thermohaline circulation, and to do so within error bounds comparable with prior model simulations (e.g., CME and DYNAMO). Quantitative comparison with comparable results obtained with the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Model (MICOM) show our terrain-following solutions are of similar overall quality when viewed against known measures of merit including meridional overturning and heat flux, Florida Straits and Gulf Stream transport, seasonal cycling of temperature and salinity, and upper ocean currents and tracer fields in the eastern North Atlantic Basin. Sensitivity studies confirm that the nonlinear vertical coordinate contributes significantly to model fidelity, and that the global inventories and spatial structure of the tracer fields are affected in important ways by the choice of lateral advection scheme.

Methods: 1250 subjects, from 18 to 64 years old, were randomly selected from the Santander (Spain) municipal census. A two-stage method was used: in the first stage, all individuals selected completed the BDI; in the second, 'probable cases' (BDI cut-off\u226513) and a random 5% sample of the total sample with a BDI score less than 13 were interviewed by psychiatrists using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), which generates diagnoses of depressive disorders. Results: Our data confirm the predictive value of the selected cut-off point (12/13): 100% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 0.72 PPV, 1 NPV, and 98% overall diagnostic value. The area under ROC (AUC) was found to be 0.99. There were no statistical differences in terms of sex or age. We conclude that the BDI is a good instrument for screening depressive disorders in community surveys. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A new statistical approach is described for predicting the irreplaceability of areas (or 'sites') within a region, defined as the likelihood that a given site will need to be protected to ensure achievement of a set of regional conservation targets. The paper begins by clarifying the relationship between irreplaceability and other conservation planning concepts such as flexibility, rarity, endemism and complementarity. We explain why direct measurement of irreplaceability is currently intractable for most real-world applications, and hence the need for prediction. A new predictive approach is proposed which overcomes a number of major shortcomings of previous approaches to predicting irreplaceability. The new approach employs the central limit theorem to estimate the expected frequency distribution of the area of a feature protected by all possible combinations of a set of sites. This expected distribution is used to estimate the total number of site combinations that would achieve target for the feature. The distribution is then used, for each site in turn, to estimate the number of these combinations for which the site of interest is a critical component. This latter number, expressed as a proportion of the estimated total number of representative combinations, provides a measure of the irreplaceability of a site for a single feature. Two techniques are presented for extending this approach to measure irreplaceability in terms of multiple features. Recent application of the new predictor to regional conservation planning in eastern New South Wales and elsewhere is described, with examples. We then present results of a preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of the predictor. Finally, we outline a future research agenda for further validation and refinement of the new technique. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Combining these results with a previously published bulk modulus (K) and \u03b4K/\u03b4P, gives a Poisson's ratio (v) of 0.268 and a shear modulus (G) of 22.6 GPa under atmospheric conditions. Assuming that v is independent of temperature gives a \u03b4K/\u03b4T value of -19.3 \u00b1 0.64 MPa K-1 at 0.5 GPa. We used the experimental data, in combination with published data, to calculate bounds on the elastic moduli of a peridotite hydrated with talc just above cold subducting lithosphere. We find that an assemblage hydrated by only 0.9 wt% H2O has elastic wave volocities (calculated from the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average) lower than the anhydrous rock by an average of 7.6% for Vp, and 9.7% for shear waves (V5) at 700\u00b0C. These results are consistent with observations of converted phase behavior in the vicinity of the surface of a coid subducting slab, and may place the low-velocity layer observed in the lowermost mantle wedge, not the uppermost slab as has previously been suggested. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The examination of presenting signs has always played an important role in the diagnosis of diseases in animal populations. In the case of diseases of tropical cattle, such expertise is often scarce and confined to those experts with many years of experience. To capture, conserve and disseminate such valuable expert knowledge remains a key challenge to the application of knowledge-based systems in veterinary medicine. In this communication, we explore the use of a Bayesian belief network to quantify expert opinion with a view to estimating the likelihood of various diseases in the presence and absence of certain signs. Information was elicited from a panel of 44 experienced veterinarians to provide the response matrix of 27 signs associated with 20 commonly occurring diseases in sub-Saharan cattle. Using this prior information, estimates of the probability of certain signs occurring with each disease were calculated from which the Bayesian belief network was able to propagate the posterior probability of each of the diseases based on the observed signs. The method as an aid in making diagnosis is discussed. It is recognised that such an approach is but one strand in the process of arriving at a diagnosis. For ease of use and accessibility, the approach has been converted into the software program CaDDiS (Cattle Disease Diagnosis System) which is available for consultation on the World Wide Web.

Simultaneous measurements of nitrogen sorption and linear length change of silica aerogels with bulk moduli between 1.8 and 16 MPa reveal a characteristic shape of the isotherm that is due to contraction and reexpansion of the sample in different phases of adsorption and desorption. The capillary pressure upon filling and emptying of mesopores results in a volumetric contraction of up to 50%. Once the mesopores in the bulk of the contracted porous backbone are completely filled, the capillary pressure is released and the material slowly reexpands, accompanied by further adsorption until the sample is fully relaxed. This is the first time that the reexpansion close to saturation has been observed. The lack of this feature in previous experiments is due to insufficient equilibration of the sample upon adsorption. Analysis of the isotherm indicates that, even for compliant samples, a breakthrough radius can be extracted that is in excellent agreement with values derived from other methods. In addition, the isotherm of compliant samples allows for a calculation of bulk modulus.",

One recording of visual evoked potentials, and recordings of auditory evoked potentials from four subjects corresponding to different age groups are analyzed. We find higher variability in older individuals. Moreover, since the EPs are identified at the single stimulus level (without need of ensemble averaging), this will allow the calculation of better resolved averages.

        "Absrtact": "The major-element composition of a grain of peridotitic Cr-pyrope garnet, coupled with a temperature estimate (T(Ni)) derived from its Ni content, can be used to calculate the forsterite (Fo) content (100Mg/(Mg+Fe)) of the coexisting olivine, using an inversion of the olivine-garnet Mg-Fe exchange geothermometer. This calculation reproduces Fo(oliv) in garnet peridotite xenoliths within \u00b10.5%. Because the T(Ni) of garnet xenocrysts in volcanic rocks can be projected to a paleogeotherm to derive a depth estimate, the application of the technique applied to suites of such xenocrysts provides a means of mapping the average Fo(oliv) of the mantle as a function of depth. Application of the technique to garnet concentrates from kimberlites and other volcanic rocks from Siberia, Australia, Canada and South Africa shows a decrease in mean Fo(oliv) with depth in most cratonic lithospheric sections. Near the base of most sections, Fo(oliv) approaches the value (Fo89-90) expected for asthenospheric mantle. The increase in Fo(oliv) toward the top of the sections is consistent with the higher degrees of partial melting at shallow depth predicted by models of melting during adiabatic decompression. However, trace-element data on the garnets suggest that these trends probably reflect more extensive melt-related metasomatism toward the base of the lithosphere. Lithospheric sections from some localities known to host lower-mantle diamonds (Slave Craton, South Australia) show that the lithospheric mantle consists of at least two distinct layers, which may reflect diapiric addition to the lower lithosphere. In the upper parts of these sections, the mean Fo(oliv) of the lithospheric mantle decreases from Archean (Fo93-94) through Proterozoic to Phanerozoic (Fo90-91.5), reflecting a secular decrease in the average degree of melt extraction from newly created lithospheric mantle. These variations in Fo(oliv) significantly affect lithosphere density and should be considered in modelling gravity and seismic data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we describe the temporal variability of TEAP conditions in shallow groundwater contaminated with both waste fuel and chlorinated solvents. TEAP parameters (including methane, dissolved iron, and dissolved hydrogen) were measured to characterize the contaminant plume over a 3-year period. We observed that concentrations of TEAP parameters changed on different time scales and appear to be related, in part, to recharge events. Changes in all TEAP parameters were observed on short time scales (months), and over a longer 3-year period. The results indicate that (1) interpretations of TEAP conditions in aquifers contaminated with a variety of organic chemicals, such as those with petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents, must consider additional hydrogen-consuming reactions (e.g., dehalogenation); (2) interpretations must consider the roles of both in situ (at the sampling point) biogeochemical and solute transport processes; and (3) determinations of microbial communities are often necessary to confirm the interpretations made from geochemical and hydrogeological measurements on these processes.

This study was conducted to validate the CENTURY model by comparing the simulated results for a continuous fallow scenario to long-term measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC) in a 50-year continuous fallow field, located in the V.V. Alekhin Central-Chernozem Biosphere State Reserve in the Kursk region of Russia. Experimental data were obtained for soil physical properties, SOC and nitrogen (N) contents for the top 20 cm of soil at the 50-year continuous fallow field and an adjacent native grassland field. All sampled soils were classified as fine-silty, mixed, frigid Pachic Hapludolls. Live and dead plant biomass, and plant roots collected at the native site were analyzed for C, N and lignin contents. These new experimental data were incorporated into the CENTURY model parameters. Following conversion of measured SOC values to dry-combustion equivalent and correction of simulation output for changes in bulk density, the CENTURY model successfully simulated SOC dynamics in the 50-year continuous fallow field. Comparison of observed and modeled SOC concentrations yielded an R2 value of 0.96. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Objectives: Our objective was to compare artificial neural networks (ANNs) with logistic regression for prediction of in-hospital death after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and to assess the impact of guiding initial ANN variable selection with univariate analysis. Background: ANNs can detect complex patterns within data. Criticisms include the unpredictability of variable selection. They have not previously been applied to outcomes modeling for percutaneous coronary interventions. Methods: A database of consecutive (n = 3019) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures from an academic tertiary referral center between July 1994 and July 1997 was used. An ANN was developed for 38 variables (unguided model) (n = 1554). A second model was developed with predictors from an univariate analysis (guided model). Both were compared with a logistic regression model developed from the same database. Mode validation was performed on independent data (n = 1465). Model predictive accuracy was assessed by the area under receiver operating characteristic curves. Goodness of fit was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. Results: Sixty unguided and guided ANNS were developed. Predictive accuracy and model calibration for all models were similar for training data but were significantly better for logistic regression for independent validation data. Overestimation of event rate in higher risk patients accounted for the majority of discrepancy in model calibration for the ANNs. This difference was partially amended by guiding variable selection. Conclusion: ANNs were able to model in-hospital death after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty when guiding variable selection. However, performance was not better than traditional modeling techniques. Further investigations are needed to understand the impact of this methodology on outcomes analysis.",

        "Absrtact": "The extent and mechanisms of adsorption of marine pore water organic matter to montmorillonite were studied in a series of batch and sequential adsorption experiments. Pore water natural organic matter (pNOM) and easily extracted natural organic matter (eNOM) were collected from Liberty Bay (Puget Sound, WA, USA) sediments. The pNOM and eNOM were each divided into two size fractions using a 1000 D ultrafilter. Batch adsorption isotherms were approximately linear, and the > 1000 D fractions of both pNOM and eNOM had larger partition coefficients (K(d)) than the < 1000 D fractions. A two-component fit of the sequential adsorption data indicated that pNOM and eNOM contained a similar amount of NOM (30%) that was not surface reactive toward montmorillonite. After correcting the batch adsorption K(d)s for the non-reactive components, the K(d)s estimated by batch and sequential adsorption were identical (~ 2.7 1/kg for > 1000 D pNOM and eNOM, and ~ 1.6 1/kg for < 1000 D pNOM and eNOM). Mechanisms of adsorption were investigated by systematically changing conditions (pH, temperature and ionic composition) of > 1000 D fractions during batch isotherm experiments. Adsorption of NOM was found to decrease with increased temperature, suggesting that hydrophobic effects were not the dominant adsorption mechanisms in this system. Ion exchange was also not an important adsorption mechanism because adsorption increased with ionic strength. The observed enhancement in adsorption with ionic strength indicated that van der Waals interactions were important in the adsorption of NOM. Ligand exchange was found to be a significant mechanism since the presence of SO4/2- in solution reduced the amount of NOM adsorbed. Ca2+ enhanced adsorption slightly more than Na+, suggesting that cation bridging was involved. The relative contributions of van der Waals interactions, ligand exchange and cation bridging were estimated to be approximately 60%, 35% and 5%, respectively, for adsorption of NOM in a CaCl2 solution.

        "Absrtact": "High-resolution Hf isotopic records are presented for hydrogenetic Fe-Mn crusts from the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans. BM1969 from the western North Atlantic has previously been shown to record systematically decreasing Nd isotopic compositions from about 60 to ~4 Ma, at which time both show a rapid decrease to unradiogenic Nd composition, thought to be related to the increasing influence of NADW or glaciation in the northern hemisphere. During the Oligocene, North Atlantic Hf became progressively less radiogenic until in the mid-Miocene (~15 Ma) it reached +1. It then shifted gradually back to an \u03b5(Hf) value of +3 at 4 Ma, since when it has decreased rapidly to about -1 at the present day. The observed shifts in the Hf isotopic composition were probably caused by variation in intensity of erosion as glaciation progressed in the northern hemisphere. Ferromanganese crusts SS663 and 109D are from about 5500 m depth in the Indian Ocean and are now separated by ~2300 km across the Mid-Indian Ridge. They display similar trends in Hf isotopic composition from 20 to 5 Ma, with the more northern crust having a composition that is consistently more radiogenic (by ~2 \u03b5(Hf) units). Paradoxically, during the last 20 Ma the Hf isotopic compositions of the two crusts have converged despite increased separation and subsidence relative to the ridge. A correlatable negative excursion at ~5 Ma in the two records may reflect a short-term increase in erosion caused by the activation of the Himalayan main central thrust. Changes to unradiogenic Hf in the central Indian Ocean after 5 Ma may alternatively have been caused by the expanding influence of NADW into the Mid-Indian Basin via circum-Antarctic deep water or a reduction of Pacific flow through the Indonesian gateway. In either case, these results illustrate the utility of the Hf isotope system as a tracer of paleoceanographic changes, capable of responding to subtle changes in erosional regime not readily resolved using other isotope systems.

The roles played by DMS oxidation products within these contexts are diverse and complex, and in many instances are not well understood. Here we summarize what is known, and suspected, about the couplings between the marine atmospheric sulfur cycle, other atmospheric chemical cycles, and the dynamics and microphysics of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. This overview focuses heavily on measurements carried out in clean Southern Ocean air masses in association with the Australian Baseline Air Pollution Station located at Cape Grim (40\u00b040'56''S, 144\u00b041'18''E), Tasmania. The data confirm that in the remote marine atmosphere, DMS is a central player in a variety of important atmospheric processes, reinforcing the need to understand quantitatively the factors that regulate DMS emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere.

The approximation takes account of the scoring scheme (i.e. gap penalty and substitution matrix or profile), sequence composition and length. Use of this formula means it is unnecessary to fit an extreme-value distribution to simulations or to the results of databank searches. The method is based on the theoretical ideas introduced by R. Mott and R. Tribe in 1999. Extensive simulation studies show that score-thresholds produced by the method are accurate to within \u00b15% 95% of the time. We also investigate factors which effect the accuracy of alignment statistics, and show that any method based on asymptotic theory is limited because asymptotic behaviour is not strictly achieved for many real protein sequences, due to extreme composition effects. Consequently, it may not be practicable to find a general formula that is significantly more accurate until the sub-asymptotic behaviour of alignments is better understood. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Isotopic characterisation of bromine could be a powerful tool for the determination of geological processes. However, no analytical procedures have been published to determine bromine stable isotope composition in natural samples, probably due to expected analytical difficulties and the expected similarity with chlorine isotopic compositions, or even because no (significant) isotopic fractionation was expected at all. We describe a method for measuring the stable bromine isotope composition in natural samples with a precision of better than 0.18\u2030. A sample containing 2-5 mg bromide is mixed with K2Cr2O7 and H2SO4. This mixture is boiled and during this process Br- is oxidised to Br2 and distilled, while Cl- is not. Thus chlorine and bromine are separated. The Br2 is reduced back to Br- and precipitated as AgBr. This is reacted with CH3I and CH3Br is formed. The gas mixture is separated by gas chromatography, and the pure CH3Br is measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. The technique has been tested on a set of natural samples (oil field formation waters) with a known chlorine isotope range between 0\u2030 and -5\u2030(SMOC). The bromine isotope range in these sample was found to be between 0\u2030 and +1.8\u2030(SMOB), indicating that processes fractionating bromine isotopes are different from those fractionating chlorine isotopes.

The induction arrows clearly show the effects of induction in the surrounding oceans. Comparison with the responses of an analogue model of the effect of the oceans on induction in the New Zealand region indicates that the induction arrows also contain information on anomalous on-land conductivity structure. The use of difference induction arrows to remove the effect of induction in the oceans from the observed responses is validated using both two- and three-dimensional numerical models pertinent to the New Zealand situation. Difference induction arrows calculated by subtracting the analogue model results from the observed data show a clear reversal, in both real and quadrature arrows, across the South Island. Two-dimensional numerical modeling of the projections of the difference arrows on to the transect shows that the response is consistent with the existence beneath the Southern Alps of an anomalously conducting region previously identified by magnetotelluric (MT) sounding. Use of the difference arrow technique is seen to be valid over a large period band because of the reduction in the coast effect response range as a result of the island situation.

The uppermost (above 40 mbsf) section of three separate holes (Holes 1037 B, 1038 I and 1038 G) was sampled; previous sedimentological and geochemical studies indicated that these holes represent a transect from unaltered to strongly hydrothermally influenced sediments. Analysis of NRM, ARM, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), hysteresis parameters and low-temperature magnetic properties suggest increasing alteration of the magnetic minerals with increasing circulation of hydrothermal circulation of fluids. Fuzzy c-means clustering combined with non-linear mapping yields a more elaborate picture because similar alteration groupings at different holes can be compared. At Hole 1037 B, a sedimentary reference site drilled away from the area of high heat flow, the rock-magnetic signal is a sensitive record of changes in detrital inputs. Magnetite and some monoclinic pyrrhotite are detected. The detrital magnetic signal is still apparent at intermediate Hole 1038 I, but cluster analysis detects an increasing hydrothermal influence on the magnetomineralogy in the lower part of the hole. Strong hydrothermal alteration at Hole 1038 G results in a complete loss of the detrital/diagenetic magnetic signal, which is replaced by a much weaker 'hydrothermal' signal composed of monoclinic pyrrhotite and pyrite. The alteration of the magnetic signal is not restricted to the uppermost few meters of the sediment column and the magnetic properties of the sediment can be used to trace even minor alterations of marine sediments related to the lateral and vertical advection of hydrothermal fluids which may easily be overlooked by more traditional methods.

        "Absrtact": "Two methods for elevation-dependent spatial interpolation of climatic data from sparse weather station networks were compared. Thirty-year monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation data from regions in western and eastern Canada were interpolated using thin-plate smoothing splines (ANUSPLIN) and a statistical method termed 'Gradient plus Inverse-Distance-Squared' (GIDS). Data were withheld from approximately 50 stations in each region and both methods were then used to predict the monthly mean values for each climatic variable at those locations. The comparison revealed lower root mean square error (RMSE) for ANUSPLIN in 70 out of 72 months (three variables for 12 months for both regions). Higher RMSE for GIDS was caused by more frequent occurrence of extreme errors. This result had important implications for surfaces generated using the two methods. Both interpolators performed best in the eastern (Ontario/Quebec) region where topographic and climatic gradients are smoother, whereas predicting precipitation in the west (British Columbia/Alberta) was most difficult. In the latter case, ANUSPLIN clearly produced better results for most months. GIDS has certain advantages in being easy to implement and understand, hence providing a useful baseline to compare with more sophisticated methods. The significance of the errors for any method should be considered in light of the planned applications (e.g., in extensive, uniform terrain with low relief, differences may not be important).

Observations on mesoscopic transpressional faults from the Salinian Block of California and transtensional faults from the Southern Apennines of Italy reveal a complex kinematic history of fault propagation. Faults initially nucleate as isolate segments, which are later kinematically and mechanically linked via development of diffuse deformation zones and/or localised oblique connecting splays. The geometry of observed mesoscopic faults is similar to that of the host, larger structures, thus suggesting that the produced fault patterns are scale independent. Moreover, the overprinting relationships among minor fault-related fabrics permit to define a relative chronology within fault arrays, thus enabling a general sequence of structural stages to be correctly established. Based on minor fabrics and their overprinting relationships, a kinematic deformation model of fault growth by segment linkage is presented, which may have a wide applicability in the field of seismic hazard evaluation.",

The benthic foraminifera prove to be excellent indicators of variations in the oxygen contents of the bottom waters, even more so than the stable isotopes. Our data indicate a step-wise restriction of the Mediterranean-Atlantic water exchange resulting in increasing sluggishness of deep-water circulation. The first indication of restricted circulation is seen at 8.5 Ma, which may correspond to a severe restriction of the external zone of the Betic Strait. A second event, which had a very serious influence on the fauna in the deeper Mediterranean, occurred at 7.16 Ma. This event was presumably linked to the partial closure of the Rifian Corridor. The restricted Mediterranean-Atlantic connection also seems to have led to a gradual salinity increase and possibly to the formation of a brine in the deepest basins, thus marking the first development towards the Messinian Salinity Crisis.

The Er3+ ions introduced in LaZr2F11, microcrystals also lie in an unique crystallographic site. A total of 31 energy levels were recorded and the crystal field analysis led to 6.6 and 7.8 cm-1 for the deviation and rms, respectively, for nine variable parameters taken into account. The experimental CF parameters for Er3+ and Eu3+ are very similar, which seems to show that the host lattice contracts around the smaller Er3+ ion.

This paper focuses on performance planning through resource allocation in supply networks by developing a profit-maximizing network model for distribution planning, and explicitly incorporating order performance criteria for distribution centers and delivery vehicles. The approach has been tested on forty realistic-sized problems, and tradeoff models provide insight and guidelines for assessing the interaction among expected profits, customer service, and operational efficiency for resource acquisition and redistribution.

        "Absrtact": "Mysids are used routinely by regulatory authorities for conducting 96 h LC50 toxicity tests to evaluate the potential hazards of pollutants to aquatic ecosystems. Data from these acute tests suggest that the European estuarine mysid Neomysis integer (Peracarida: Mysidacea) is comparatively sensitive to trace metals and organophosphate pesticides, and may be a suitable alternative to the frequently-used sub-tropical American mysid Americamysis (\u2261Mysidopsis) bahia for testing the toxicity of chemical contaminants to European estuarine biota. There is, however, growing demand for the development of toxicity tests which are more representative of the effects of toxic contaminants on natural populations, and which provide results that are more readily extrapolated to natural ecosystems, than acute tests. Behavioural disruption, particularly of swimming ability, is used increasingly in laboratory toxicity studies as a sensitive endpoint for assessing the effects of contaminants on aquatic biota. This paper describes a sensitive laboratory technique, using an annular flume, to determine the effects of an organophosphate pesticide on the swimming behaviour of N. integer. Following 7-day exposure to 0.038 \u03bcg chlorpyrifos l-1, mysids became hyperactive and more swam forward into a slow current (3 cm s-1) than control mysids. Despite this hyperactivity, pesticide-exposed mysids were unable to swim faster than 15 cm s-1, whereas control mysids were able to swim faster than 18 cm s-1. Other changes in swimming behaviour following pesticide exposure included fewer mysids maintaining position, and more mysids swimming with the current at high current velocities (18 cm s-1), than control individuals. These responses of chlorpyrifos-exposed N. integer are predicted to cause reduced ability of N. integer to maintain position in the natural estuarine habitat. Furthermore, the swimming behaviour of N. integer was affected at pesticide concentrations below the 7 day LC50 (0.084 \u03bcg chlorpyrifos l-1), highlighting the importance of using sub-lethal toxicity studies for predicting environmental consequences of pollutant discharge.

On top of the poorly sorted aeolian sediments, a cambic aridisol with a mighty Cca horizon containing numerous calcite nodules developed, presumably during the transition period between the Middle and Younger Holocene, and was finally covered by desert margin loess. A relatively humid period during the Younger Holocene is documented by another brown soil, which has developed on top of younger aeolian sediments and is itself covered beneath recent sands in the basin of Omungunda.

We use our method to estimate conditional quantiles (VaR) and conditional expected shortfalls (the expected size of a return exceeding VaR), this being an alternative measure of tail risk with better theoretical properties than the quantile. Using backtesting of historical daily return series we show that our procedure gives better 1-day estimates than methods which ignore the heavy tails of the innovations or the stochastic nature of the volatility. With the help of our fitted models we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to estimating the conditional quantiles of returns over multiple-day horizons and find that this outperforms the simple square-root-of-time scaling method. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "This study was done to evaluate the impact of pure Norway spruce stands on physical soil properties of top soil in comparison to mixed species stands on comparable sites. It was hypothesized that the flat root system of spruce causes soil compaction, which would have a negative impact on the soil aeration and hydraulic properties and consequently on seedbed quality, as well as early tree growth and seedling establishment. Hence, this topic is important for forest restoration, especially converting secondary pure spruce stands to mixed species stands. Forty-eight sites (24 pairs pure spruce stand/mixed species stand) of different stand development stages (mature stage, pole stage) were selected on two different bedrock materials (Molasse, Flysch). Undisturbed soil cores were taken from 0-4 and 4-8 cm soil depth and the following soil parameters were determined: (total) bulk density, remaining fine soil bulk density, dry masses of coarse fragments, roots and forest floor, organic carbon content, total soil pore volume as well as macropore volumes (after free drainage for 24 h and after water desorption at 10 kPa). The remaining fine soil bulk density was a useful parameter for characterization of the state of compactness. Pure spruce stands caused a lower bulk density of the upper mineral soil due to lifting and loosening of the soil above the root system. Results of calculated macropore volumes after water desorption at 10 kPa were exactly conform with those obtained for the remaining fine soil bulk density, indicating significant differences for the grouping variables bedrock material and species composition. It is concluded from this study that changes of soil physical properties of the upper mineral soil (0-8 cm soil depth) by Norway spruce will not reduce germination and growth of mixed species trees. However, chemical and nutritional changes were not subject of this study, which are expected to limit the success of forest restoration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The temporal and spatial evolution of the solute plumes was monitored over 398 days for bromide and 449 days for uranin and lithium. The spatial variability of basic aquifer parameters, hydraulic conductivity, and sorption parameters of the aquifer material was investigated in detail. Local Darcian velocities were measured using NH4Br82 as a radioactive tracer in 33 observation wells. Vertical and horizontal correlation lengths of hydraulic properties were determined using variogram analysis. The magnitude of the local Darcian velocities was found to be lognormally distributed. In addition, the groundwater flow direction showed a clear trend in the vertical direction. The horizontal correlation length of the magnitude of Darcian velocity agreed with the correlation length of K estimated from grain size data. Batch experiments on aquifer sediments showed that sorption of uranin and lithium could be described by a Freundlich isotherm. The Freundlich n parameter of uranin sorption showed little variation with depth. The time evolution of the bromide plume was quantified in terms of spatial moments. The longitudinal effective dispersivity estimated from spatial moment analysis was within the range of calculated effective dispersivities, taking into account the uncertainty of estimates of the lnK statistics. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: The onset of acute myocardial infarction varies by time of day, with a peak in the morning and a trough at night. Whether infarct-related complications differ by the timing of the infarction is unknown. Methods and Results: In the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, we performed chart reviews and face-to-face interviews with 3625 patients with acute myocardial infarction. We assessed the time of onset of symptoms, the presence of ventricular tachycardia or congestive heart failure, and peak creatine kinase levels (in 1043 patients). We found significant circadian variation in the risk of congestive heart failure (P = .001). The risk dropped from 17% for infarctions that began between 6 PM and midnight to 10% for infarctions that began between 6 AM and noon. Adjustment for differences in the time from symptom onset to presentation for care and use of thrombolytic agents did not change the results. We found no circadian variation in the risk of ventricular tachycardia or in peak creatine kinase levels. Conclusions: The risk of congestive heart failure is highest among infarctions that begin at night. Further research may clarify whether this reflects differences in the pathophysiologic characteristics of infarction or the quality of medical care provided for daytime and nighttime infarctions.",

Although this issue is widely recognized, developmentalists and economists have used different statistical methods when testing whether child care experiences are related to child outcomes and have drawn different conclusions from their analyses. This paper discusses some of the family selection issues that should be considered in child care research and provides empirical evidence demonstrating why each issue should be considered. These issues include whether causal inferences can be made from observational studies and the impact on conclusions from regression analyses that include highly correlated measures of child care experiences, nonrepresentative samples, and family covariates with bi-directional effects on child care quality. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

Structural model requirements are formulated, eliminating immediately some candidate model types. Promising modelling approaches are thoroughly analysed and, if applicable, adapted to the specific needs: two models developed by Casolari (1988), the inactivation model of Sapru et al. (1992), the model of Whiting (1993), the Baranyi and Roberts growth model (1994), the model of Chiruta et al. (1997), the model of Daughtry et al. (1997) and the model of Xiong et al. (1999). A range of experimental data of Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus sake are used to illustrate the different models' performances. Moreover, a novel modelling approach is developed, fulfilling all formulated structural model requirements, and based on a careful analysis of literature knowledge of the shoulder and tailing phenomenon. Although a thorough insight in the occurrence of shoulders and tails is still lacking from a biochemical point of view, this newly developed model incorporates the possibility of a straightforward interpretation within this framework.

        "Absrtact": "High-precision garnet chronometry using the Sm-Nd, U-Pb, Rb-Sr or Lu-Hf isotope systems is gaining widespread application for constraining the prograde and high-temperature history of metamorphic belts. However, due to the low concentrations of the chronometrically important elements, garnet analyses are often susceptible to incorporation of small quantities of accessory phases such as zircon, monazite and allanite. Here we assess the extent to which such inclusions affect garnet analyses by comparing in situ analyses of Sm and Nd concentrations in the crystal lattice, obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with those obtained by isotope dilution (ID) on separates of the same garnets. The results show that the garnets studied here are largely free from inclusions. In general, however, the low concentrations of Sm and Nd in the garnet lattice mean that the incorporation of even very small quantities of accessory phases will result in a significant change in the measured garnet Sm and Nd concentration. Simple modelling of the effect of such inclusions on age information shows that garnet inclusion disequilibrium and the extent to which inclusions decrease the apparent parent-daughter ratio are critical. Such modelling demonstrates that the incorporation of old LREE-enriched minerals such as monazite will yield an apparently lower age than the true garnet age. However, this study indicates that erroneous age information can be identified if duplicate garnet analyses are performed. In addition, LA-ICP-MS is shown to be a useful technique in verifying the purity of samples for isotope analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Calcareous dinoflagellate cysts appear to be widely distributed throughout the studied area. In the surface sediments, concentrations (cyst per gram dry sediment) of the vegetative stage Thoracosphaera heimii are generally higher than that of the (presumably) calcareous resting cysts. Distribution patterns in surface sediments of Orthopithonella granifera (Futterer) Keupp and Versteegh, Rhabdothorax spp. Kamptner., Sphaerodinella albatrosiana (Kamptner) Keupp and Versteegh S. albatrosiana praratabulated, Sphaerodinella tuberosa var. 1 (Kamptner) Keupp and Versteegh and S. tuberosa var. 2 and the ratios between these species have been compared with temperature, salinity, density and stratification gradients in the upper water column. Rhabdothorax spp. is characteristically present in sediments of more temperate regions characterized by high seasonality. Dinoflagellates producing these cysts are able to tolerate high nutrient concentrations, and mixing of the water column. S. albatrosiana is abundant in regions characterized by high sea surface temperatures and oligotrophic surface water conditions. In contrast, the distribution of S. tuberosa var. 2 is negatively related to temperature. The other cyst species did not show a characteristic pattern in relation to the studied environmental gradients. The ratio of Sphaerodinella tuberosa var. 2 to Orthopithonella granifera can be used for reconstructing the presence of stratification in the upper 50 m of the water column, whereas the ratios of S. tuberosa var. 2 to Sphaerodinella albatrosiana and of O. granifera to Rhabdothorax spp. might be used for palaeotemperature reconstructions. Calcareous dinoflagellate cysts are abundant in oligotrophic areas and may be useful for the reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Whilst the interplay between tectonics, glaciation and oceanography is reasonably well understood on some high-latitude margins, relatively little is known about the nature of Quaternary processes affecting the continental margin north of the Faeroe Islands. We therefore present side-scan sonar (GLORIA and TOBI) and 3.5 kHz data in combination with a new regional bathymetry in order to characterise and analyse the margin's physiography and the sedimentary processes that have occurred in the area during the Late Quaternary. Seven acoustic facies are identified and interpreted, in combination with published core records. The margin is subject to differing sedimentation regimes over glacial/interglacial cycles, relating to the changing importance of contouritic, hemipelagic, glacimarine and mass-movement processes. Mass movement is much more extensive than previously thought, with a total sediment volume of >2000 km3, similar to that of the Storegga Slide (5500 km3) and may occur primarily at glacial terminations. The downslope limit of instabilities is associated with a series of channels, focusing the deposition of distal, turbiditic sediments into the regional deep beyond. Together with glacigenic debris flows from the western margin of the North Sea Fan, mass-movement processes are identified to have affected 52-70% of the North Faeroes margin area. In contrast, distal glacimarine sedimentation, alternating with hemipelagic and contouritic development, is found on the remaining 30-48% of the margin during glacials, and hemipelagic and contouritic Sedimentation are active across 90% of the margin in interglacial conditions. Despite a lack of any local, direct glacial influence, these observations on the relative importance of sedimentation processes are comparable with other glacially influenced passive margins.

The ratio of the overall SG between the linear and circular polarization (i.e., measure of suppression) undergoes an intensity dependent decrease from large initial values to asymptotic limits, irrespective of samples.",

        "Absrtact": "Extensive research has been conducted regarding the occurrence of herbicides in the hydrologic system, their fate, and their effects on human health and the environment. Few studies, however, have considered herbicide transformation products (degradates). In this study of Iowa ground water, herbicide degradates were frequently detected. In fact, herbicide degradates were eight of the 10 most frequently detected compounds. Furthermore, a majority of a herbicide's measured concentration was in the form of its degradates - ranging from 55 to over 99%. The herbicide detection frequencies and concentrations varied significantly among the major aquifer types sampled. These differences, however, were much more pronounced when herbicide degradates were included. Aquifer types presumed to have the most rapid recharge rates (alluvial and bedrock/karst region aquifers) were those most likely to contain detectable concentrations of herbicide compounds. Two indirect estimates of ground-water age (depth of well completion and dissolved-oxygen concentration) were used to separate the sampled wells into general vulnerability classes (low, intermediate, and high). The results show that the herbicide detection frequencies and concentrations varied significantly among the vulnerability classes regardless of whether or not herbicide degradates were considered. Nevertheless, when herbicide degradates were included, the frequency of herbicide compound detection within the highest vulnerability class approached 90%, and the median total herbicide residue concentration increased over an order of magnitude, relative to the parent compounds alone, to 2 \u03bcg/l. The results from this study demonstrate that obtaining data on herbicide degradates is critical for understanding the fate of herbicides in the hydrologic system. Furthermore, the prevalence of herbicide degradates documented in this study suggests that to accurately determine the overall effect on human health and the environment of a specific herbicide its degradates should also be considered.

Attention is focused on the problem of the homogeneity of data from different sources, different periods and using different reference benchmarks. To overcome these problems, we propose a general levelling network covering the whole area of the valley, south of the Po river, connected with a GPS network of more than 50 points. This network will represent a spatial and temporal reference framework for all the measurements made in the past and for those planned for the future.

        "Absrtact": "Time series of suspended-silt concentration (measured by an optical backscatter sensor) and suspended-sand concentration (measured by an acoustic backscatter sensor) in a deep channel (14 m MSL) of a large New Zealand estuary (Manukau Harbour) are analysed. Suspended-sand concentration varied in phase with the current speed and bed shear stress on a ~ 6.2-h cycle, but suspended-silt concentration varied on a semidiurnal (~ 12.4-h) cycle such that the channel was clear of silt at high tide and maximum silt concentration occurred at low tide. Threshold for initiation of sand motion was found to be related to local skin friction, sand concentration profiles were consistent with settling flux balanced by gradient diffusion with a two-layer sediment diffusivity dependent on local friction velocity, suspended-sand reference concentration was explainable in terms of local skin friction, and changes in the channel-bed sediment were correlated with the suspended-sand load. Therefore, sand suspension in the channel is a 'local' process and the channel bed is the source of the suspended-sand load. Suspended-sand flux was found to be a highly nonlinear function of the tidal current speed in the channel. In that case, tidal-current velocity asymmetry is the principal determinant of direction of net sand transport and the ebb/flood-dominance concept is valid. The relative phase of the M2 and M4 constituents of the tidal-current velocity, which quantifies tidal-current asymmetry, was calculated from a tide model of the estuary and results were mapped. The harbour was found to be broadly ebb dominant and therefore self-flushing of sand. Silt suspension in the channel was not related to the local boundary-layer dynamics, but was explainable in terms of the movement up and down the channel of a horizontal gradient in silt concentration, which implies the existence of a turbid water mass that is perched on the surrounding intertidal flats at high tide and that drains into the channel during ebb tide. Silt concentration in the channel increased during a short storm, which corresponded to the passage through the measurement site of a 'turbid fringe' that was formed on the surrounding intertidal flats during the previous high tide under the action of breaking waves. Wave activity on the surrounding intertidal flats is therefore the principal determinant of suspended-silt load in the channel and an approach that treats waves and sediment pathways between intertidal flats and channels is needed for modelling silt transport.

Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 60 periurethral collagen injections performed on 40 consecutive women from January 1996 to December 1997. A review of the office chart and operative notes was performed to obtain demographic, urodynamic, and procedural data. Outcome data were obtained by personal or telephone interview, using patients' subjective assessments including an analog satisfaction scale. Results: Nine of 40 patients (23%) had urethral hypermobility. Compared with patients without hypermobility, patients with hypermobility required a similar number of procedures (a mean of 1.9 compared with 1.4, P = .13) and required similar amounts of collagen on the first injection (5.6 mL compared with 5.3 mL, P = .69). Preoperative urodynamic parameters were similar in both groups. Rates of subjective dryness were equivalent in patients with and without hypermobility at 1 month (76% and 46%, P = .24) and at 6 months (71% and 32%, P = .09) following initial injection. A post hoc power analysis was performed to evaluate the primary study measures of continence at 1 and 6 months, and number of collagen injections. This revealed that a sample size of 40 patients would be sufficient to detect a 2.5-fold difference in number of injections and a 3- fold difference in subjective dryness. Conclusion: Coexisting urethral hypermobility should not preclude the use of collagen injections in women with stress urinary incontinence.

AquaFarm provides: (1) simulation of physical, chemical, and biological unit processes; (2) simulation of facility and fish culture management; (3) compilation of facility resource and enterprise budgets; and (4) a graphical user interface and data management capabilities. These analytical tools are combined into an interactive, decision support system for the simulation, analysis, and evaluation of alternative design and management strategies. The quantitative methods and models used in AquaFarm are primarily adapted from the aquaculture science and engineering literature and mechanistic in nature. In addition, new methods have been developed and empirically based simplifications implemented as required to construct a comprehensive, practically oriented, system level, aquaculture simulator. In the use of AquaFarm, aquaculture production facilities can be of any design and management intensity, for purposes of broodfish maturation, egg incubation, and/or growout of finfish or crustaceans in cage, single pass, serial reuse, water recirculation, or solar-algae pond systems. The user has total control over all facility and management specifications, including site climate and water supplies, components and configurations of fish culture systems, fish and facility management strategies, unit costs of budget items, and production species and objectives (target fish weights/states and numbers at given future dates). In addition, parameters of unit process models are accessible to the user, including species-specific parameters of fish performance models. Based on these given specifications, aquaculture facilities are simulated, resource requirements and enterprise budgets compiled, and operation and management schedules determined so that fish production objectives are achieved. When facility requirements or production objectives are found to be operationally or economically unacceptable, desired results are obtained through iterative design refinement. Facility performance is reported to the user as management schedules, summary reports, enterprise budgets, and tabular and graphical compilations of time-series data for unit process, fish, and water quality variables. Application of AquaFarm to various types of aquaculture systems is demonstrated. AquaFarm is applicable to a range of aquaculture interests, including education, development, and production.

A NW-SE extension developed in the Oligocene (D1) along three main conjugate fault systems arranged in orthorhombic symmetry (N-NW- and SE-dipping). Cooling rate contour maps, from published apatite and zircon fission-tract ages and Rb/Sr biotite ages, highlight the differential exhumation of large fault-bounded blocks during this phase, whilst synkinematic hydrothermal veins and calc-alkaline dykes (29-32 Ma) help to constrain its age. From the Miocene onwards, a general rearrangement of the strain pattern led to SW-directed lateral extrusion (D2) of the Pennine-Graian Alps block, bounded by a network of seismogenic shear zones, the most important being the Ospizio Sottile. Simplon. Rhone and Chamonix faults. The internal deformation of the Pennine-Graian Alps block is characterised by an overall more or less homogeneous NE-SW extension. The approach undertaken, integrating remote sensing. structural analysis on different scales, and thermochronology (with the cooling rate map representation), is therefore effective in reconstructing the late-orogenic extensional tectonic evolution of metamorphic nappe stacks. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The ocean is an important sink for carbon and heat, yet high-resolution measurements of biogeochemical properties relevant to global climate change are being made only sporadically in the ocean at present. There is a growing need for automated, real-time, long-term measurements of CO2 in the ocean using a network of sensors, strategically placed on ships, moorings, free-drifting buoys and autonomous remotely operated vehicles. The ground-truthing of new sensor technologies is a vital component of present and future efforts to monitor changes in the ocean carbon cycle and air-sea exchange of CO2. A comparison of a moored Carbon Interface Ocean Atmosphere (CARIOCA) buoy and shipboard fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) measurements was conducted in the western North Atlantic during two extended periods (> 1 month) in 1997. The CARIOCA buoy was deployed on the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM), which is located 5 km north of the site of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). The high frequency of sampling revealed that temperature and fCO2 responded to physical forcing by the atmosphere on timescales from diurnal to 4-8 days. Concurrent with the deployments of the CARIOCA buoy, frequent measurements of surface fCO2 were made from the R/V Weatherbird II during opportunistic visits to the BTM and BATS sites, providing a direct calibration of the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data. Although, the in situ ground-truthing of the CARIOCA buoy was complicated by diurnal processes, sub-mesoscale and fine-scale variability, the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data was accurate within 3 \u00b1 6 \u03bcatm of shipboard fCO2 data for periods up to 50 days. Longer-term assessments were not possible due to the CARIOCA buoy breaking free of the BTM and drifting into waters with different fCO2-temperature properties. Strategies are put forward for future calibration of other in situ sensors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Five core groups are revealed by the quantitative analysis and interpreted as representing five marine biotic provinces. They are the Cathaysian (tropical), Western Tethyan (tropical), Himalayan (warm temperate), Austrazean (cold temperate) and Greenland - Svalbard Provinces (cold temperate). The Cathaysian Province is composed of many isolated or semi-isolated islands situated in the Palaeotethys, whereas the other four provinces occurred mainly on the continental shelves of Pangea: the Western Tethyan Province along the western coast of the Palaeotethys, the Himalayan Province on the northern margin of Gondwanaland, the Austrazean Province along the southeastern margin of Gondwanaland, and the Greenland - Svalbard Province on the northern margin of Pangea. In addition, nonmetric multidimensional scaling helped to identify key biogeographic determinants: latitude-related thermal gradient appears to have accounted for most of the variance in the data; geographic distance and ocean circulation may have also played a major, but subordinate, role in the delineation and/or enhancement of some of the provinces. Comparison with Early and Middle Permian global marine provincialism indicates that marine biotic provinces had significantly reduced during the Lopingian (Late Permian) in the lead up to the end-Permian mass extinction.

        "Absrtact": "During the Holocene, the eastern Sahara underwent a drastic climatic change: in less than 6000 years, the climate changed from hyperaridity to semiaridity and back to its current hyperarid state. The West Nubian Palaeolake Basin in NW Sudan (ca 18.5\u00b0N/25.5\u00b0E) contains widespread lake carbonates, which indicate development of a freshwater lake between approximately 9500 and 4000 years BP. The size of the lake has been estimated as between 1100 and 7000 km2. Water balance calculations and a dense drainage net surrounding the terminal lake indicate predominance of superficial and minor importance of groundwater inflow. A lake with an area of 1100 km2 would require an annual precipitation of approximately 500 mm to balance the respective aerial evaporation. Similar precipitation values are currently observed at a latitude of 12\u00b0N, some 600 km farther south, while the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin receives an annual rainfall of less than 15 mm/year. A lake size of 7000 km2 would have required 900 mm of annual rainfall, an amount characteristic of sub-tropical conditions. This value could indicate inhomogenities in the wet phase climate, which could strongly influence the water level of a terminal lake located in a flat terrain. The highly depleted oxygen isotope values of the lake carbonates indicate that the Holocene wet phase was characterized by intense tropical summer (monsoonal) rainfall with heavy thunderstorms. Thus, an intensified southwest palaeomonsoon apparently transported large quantities of moisture to the eastern Sahara, producing the necessary conditions for the persisting existence of freshwater in the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin. The reconstructed palaeoclimate implies high groundwater levels and corresponds to precipitation rates from other sites in North Africa. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The effects of molecular weight on the thermostability and the decomposition kinetic parameters of PTT under argon and air were discussed systematically. The effects of atmosphere (air, argon, and nitrogen) were also investigated. The experimental data showed that under argon atmosphere PTT exhibited mainly one decomposition step, and all of the initial degradation temperature, the temperature at the maximum weight-loss rate, the activation energy E, order n and frequency factor Z for decomposition increased with molecular weights. However, under air atmosphere PTT exhibited two main degradation stages. Characteristic temperatures increased but decomposition kinetic parameters decreased with molecular weights for the first decomposition stage. Nevertheless little variation of characteristic temperatures and degradation kinetic parameters has been observed for the second degradation stage. In addition, the decomposition process of PTT (or PET) in argon is similar to that in nitrogen, while much different degradation mechanism can be found in air. In brief, PTT and PET show much lower initial decomposition temperature and degradation-activation energy in air than in nitrogen and argon.",

        "Absrtact": "In an effort to aid future research and forest management decisions, we incorporated data on forest type, soils and topography into a geographic information systems (GIS)-based ecological land classification system for Natchez Trace State Forest (NTSF) in western Tennessee. The area is still recovering from the effects of cultivation, logging, forest clearing and grazing during the 1800s and early 1900s, but the data indicated that most stands now contain sawtimber-sized trees after more than 50 years of secondary succession. Our analyses showed that forest types were not randomly associated with soil characteristics or topography. For example, the most heavily gullied lands were strongly associated with pine forests while hardwoods were more associated with upland soils and certain types of sideslopes. Mature hardwood stands, which were deemed to be of the greatest conservation value, were classified into eight ecological land types based on soil type, aspect, orientation and topographic setting for further study. When these land types were evaluated with respect to data on forest composition and environmental conditions collected in the field, we found that the variables used to derive the eight classes were important in influencing floristic patterns. It was, however, clear that the classes themselves imperfectly captured patterns of overstory community composition for a number of reasons. Thus, while land types provide a potentially valuable management tool, their utility and successful implementation are dependent upon a recognition of their inherent limitations.

        "Absrtact": "We examined structural features of montane ash stands that varied from 15 to 300+ years of age in the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Extensive field data were gathered for our investigation and were drawn from >3700 survey plots on >625 sites located throughout the study region. Much of our study focussed on understorey features because extensive past studies in these forests have highlighted their importance as key habitat components for wildlife. A wide range of stand features, including the abundance of shrubs, the prevalence of tree ferns, the presence of Acacia spp., the presence of Myrtle Beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii), and the number of vegetation strata (a measure of vertical heterogeneity) varied considerably between age classes; most attributes were significantly (p < 0.001) less likely to occur or were significantly less abundant in young logged forests. Highly significant differences in these structural features also were found in stands dominated by different tree species (Mountain Ash [Eucalyptus regnans] and Alpine Ash [E. delegatensis]). The traditional view of disturbance in montane ash forests is that of high-intensity stand-replacing wildfires which produce even-aged regrowth forests. However, our data suggest that low-intensity, non-stand-replacing fires or only partial stand-replacing fires, have occurred in many old-growth montane ash stands, both to create multi-aged stands and to re-juvenate components of the understorey - a process leading to asynchrony in the ages of understorey and some elements of the overstorey. Thus, the structural variability, and the patterns of natural disturbance leading to such conditions, appears to be more complex than often previously recognised. This has important implications for both nature conservation strategies and timber harvesting practices in montane ash forests. Existing high-intensity clearfell logging operations produce an even-aged dominant overstorey as well as understorey and overstorey plants of the same age. If logging effects are to more closely resemble natural disturbance regimes and promote structural complexity in stands of harvested forest to enhance wildlife habitat values, then a wider range of types of harvesting methods (in addition to clearfelling) need to be employed.

Images are typically retrieved based on a given sample image, a sketch or a simple description of the content. The rate of this retrieval is undeniably gaining importance as databases increase constantly in size. In this paper, we present MOSAIC, an image retrieval system that we have developed. In MOSAIC, an image is represented by a set of clusters, each of which captures information on multiple features - the `color' of the cluster, the `size' of the cluster and the `spatial' location of the cluster. We also propose an index structure, to facilitate speed retrieval of images. The structure is multitier with each tier dealing with one feature. In this way, images that are dissimilar in the higher tier can be pruned away immediately. We implemented and evaluated MOSAIC, and our results show that the system can retrieve relevant images effectively and efficiently.",

        "Absrtact": "Climate proxy records often show regional heterogeneity due to the complex interplay of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and local topographic features. This is especially prevalent in the mountainous regions of the western United States where the interaction of two seasonally distinct weather systems can result in locally abrupt climate boundaries. Here we establish oxygen isotope ratios of goethite from ferricrete chronosequences formed by natural acid rock drainage as a new source of spatially small-scale Holocene climate information. Systematic study of these deposits may prove useful in understanding regional variations in response to global Holocene climate change. Oxygen isotope ratios of goethites from the mountainous northeastern Yellowstone region show an increase of ~3\u2030 over the past 9000 years. We attribute this isotopic change to a local increase of isotopically heavier summer precipitation since the early Holocene, possibly augmented by seasonal temperature differences brought on by orbitally forced insolation changes over the past 9000 years. Our interpretation is compatible with palynology studies as well as Holocene climate simulations, which indicate a decrease in monsoon intensity from 9000 years B.P. to the present. Unlike the southwestern United States, this change may have resulted in wetter summers in our study area. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The segments show a range of volcanic and tectonic types, but in general the northernmost segments (i.e. those with greater influence from the Azorean hotspot) are shallower and more volcanically robust than those to the south, with hydrothermal activity in segment centres (for example, Menez Gwen and Lucky Strike). Nonetheless, this generalisation requires some modification due to temporal variations in the balance between magmatic supply and tectonic dismemberment. The NTOs are broad right-stepping discontinuities, locally up to 25 km wide, and accommodate offsets between 10 and 50 km. The discontinuities are mostly sediment-floored, and link the spreading segment tips with a range of structures. These include locally dense arrays of en echelon extensional normal faults, short lengths of linear strike-slip fault strands occasionally cutting basement blocks apparently stranded within the offsets. Basement blocks within the offsets are cross-cut by complexes of intersecting faults, suggesting that deformation is distributed across the zone. The pervasive faulting taking place at the NTOs favours fluid circulation and associated hydrothermal activity, as at the Rainbow Site at 36\u00b017'N. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The distribution of Nb and Ta among the continental crust, the depleted mantle and subducted slabs and mass balance of bulk-silicate-earth require that a significant mass of deeply subducted oceanic slabs is hidden in the lower mantle. The characteristic Nb/Ta ratios of continental crust (ca. 12) and eclogitic oceanic crustal slabs (ca. 33) likely result from element fractionation during slab dehydration. This is because the most efficient mechanism of fractionating the chemical twins Nb and Ta is by chemical complexing in hydrous solutions. The near-chondritic present-day Nb/Ta ratio of the depleted mantle (ca. 17) suggests that similar proportions of Nb and Ta have been recycled from both the continents and oceanic slabs over geological time. Furthermore, the Nb and Ta contents of a worldwide suite of MORB samples are very well-correlated (r2 = 0.996), which shows that the depleted mantle is very well-mixed for high-field-strength elements. Long-term existence of chemically distinct oceanic crust or sediment reservoirs in the depleted mantle is therefore unlikely. This strongly suggests that high Nb/Ta slabs, which are required to balance the low Nb/Ta continental lithosphere, are hidden in the lower mantle. There is no evidence that these deeply subducted slabs are a significant source component of ocean-island basalts. Rather, the chondritic Nb/Ta ratio of the majority of ocean-island basalts suggests that these rocks are derived either from an undepleted portion of the lower mantle, and/or from the depleted mantle.

The surface heat budget was computed over the entire GSL for the 7 ice-free months (May-November incl.) by using SST maps in combination with atmospheric fields and satellite-derived monthly averaged cloud cover data. Monthly means of mixed-layer depth, upper-layer heat content and upper-layer stratification were obtained for 15 sub-regions of the GSL.

Results: College graduation in the next 10 years was negatively associated with smoking and marijuana use, but not daily alcohol consumption in all ethnic and gender groups. In Whites, marijuana use was associated with less prestigious occupations and lower family income, while smoking was unrelated and moderate daily drinking was positively associated. In Blacks, marijuana use was generally unrelated to occupational measures, while smoking and daily alcohol consumption were negatively associated. Conclusions: Relationships between smoking, marijuana use, daily drinking, and occupational attainment were not universally negative in this age group. Substance use, particularly smoking, is associated with reduced occupational attainment in Blacks compared with Whites after considering sociodemographic factors potentially limiting educational progression and occupational attainment.

Measurements were performed at a high confining pressure on a total of 12 representative samples of the Alboran Domain (Internal Betics). P-wave mean velocities, referred to pressure conditions of 280\u00b110 MPa, range from 5.82 to 7.13 km s-1, the maximum values corresponding to high amphibolite facies metapelites (garnet gneiss). Under these pressure conditions, V(p) anisotropies range from 1.2 to 16.1%, with the lowest values being associated with granitic rocks and the highest values associated with metapelites from the upper structural units. P-wave velocities were calculated for prevailing P-T conditions at depths of 10, 20, 30 and 40 km. We discuss the significance of the analyzed rock-types in terms of metamorphic grade and derived V(p) at different crustal/levels. P-wave velocities and densities measured on low-to-middle and middle-to-high grade metamorphic rocks are compatible with values obtained from previous seismic and gravity studies for the upper and middle crust, respectively. At lower crustal levels, the integration of our measurements with other geophysical data suggests the presence of partial melting of high-grade metamorphic rocks. The estimation of the impedance contrast from the measured physical properties suggests that the reflective character of the mid-lower crust is associated with shear/mylonitic zones and/or fine-scale lithological layering enhanced by partial melting.

An overview of 22 applications of Markov chain models is presented, using data from four sources examining different grassland communities with varying sampling techniques, data types and vegetation parameters. For microdata, individual transitions have been observed, and several statistical tests of model assumptions are performed. The goodness of fit of the model predictions is assessed both for micro- and macrodata using the mean square error, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. It is concluded that the performance of the model varies between data sets, microdata generate a lower mean square error than aggregated macrodata, and time steps of one year are preferable to three months. The rank order of dominant species is found to be the most reliable prediction achievable with the models proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The timescales of element transfer at volcanic arcs provide important insights into magma generation, movement and storage beneath destructive margin volcanoes. Here we present major, trace and Sr-, Nd- and U-series isotope data on <200 ka old samples from Santorini in the Aegean volcanic arc as a case study of a hazardous destructive margin volcano. Samples range from low-K calc-alkaline basalts to high-K rhyolites, are enriched in light rare earth elements and fluid mobile trace elements, and have negative Ta, Nb and Ti anomalies characteristic of arc magmatism. 87Sr/86Sr ratios range from 0.7035 to 0.7054 and are negatively correlated with 143Nd/144Nd ratios, ranging from 0.51285 to 0.51263. Lavas from the second eruptive cycle (~ 180 ka-~3.6 ka) are in U-Th radioactive equilibrium, and a whole-rock, plagioclase, magnetite U-Th mineral isochron from a 67\u00b19 ka dacite yields an age of 85 (+22/-19) ka (1\u03c3). Samples from the Kameni islands (46 AD-1950) show small but significant uranium excesses, with (238U/232Th) = 0.91-1.04 and (230Th/232Th) = 0.91-0.97, suggesting that the time since U-Th differentiation is \u2264 147 (+27/-21) ky (1\u03c3). A U-Th mineral isochron from the 1940 Kameni dacite yields an age indistinguishable from its eruption age. The Kameni samples show variable Ra depletion, with (226Ra/230Th) = 0.92-0.99. The range in Sr and Nd isotope data reflects progressive crustal assimilation. The combined trace element and isotope data are consistent with a three-component source model involving mantle wedge, sediment melts and slab-derived fluids. While initial 238U-excesses in the second eruptive cycle have decayed, implying slab-derived fluid addition > 180 ky prior to eruption, for the Kameni lavas fluid addition to the wedge is \u2264 150 ky. U-Th mineral isochrons indicate that crystal residence times in the subvolcanic plumbing system are short. Fractional crystallisation less than ~ 1 ky prior to eruption of the Kameni dacites is suggested by (226Ra/230Th) < 1. The combined data imply that timescales of magmatic differentiation in crustal reservoirs are short, that transfer time of the slab-fluid signature through the mantle wedge varies through time.",

        "Absrtact": "High-resolution, three-dimensional, compressional and shear wave velocity models, derived from microearthquake traveltimes, are used to map the distribution of Poisson's ratio and porosity at Coso Geothermal Area, Inyo County, California. Spatial resolution of the three-dimensional Poisson's ratio and porosity distributions is estimated to be 0.5 km horizontally and 0.8 km vertically. Model uncertainties, \u00b11% in the interior and \u00b12.3% around the edge of the model, are estimated by a jackknife method. We use perturbations of r = V(p)/V(s) ratio and \u03a8 = V(p) \u00b7 V(s) product to derive distributions of Poisson's ratio, \u03c3, and porosity, which are then used to constrain and delineate possible zones of intense heat, fracture accumulation and fluid saturation. Poisson's ratio at Coso ranges from 0.15 to 0.35 with an average of 0.224, lower than the crustal average of 0.25. High Poisson's ratios are more extensive in shallower depths (<1.5 km) while lower Poisson's ratios are found in the deeper section (1.5-3.0 km) of the target area. Two major features with low Poisson's ratio are identified at geothermal production depth (1-3 km) around stations S2-S6 and S1-S3-S4. The two low-\u03c3 features are separated by a northwest-southeast-trending high-\u03c3 belt with variable width of 1-3 km. A high-\u03a8 body is found around S2 and S6, and extends down in depth. A circular, low-\u03a8 belt corresponding to the high-\u03c3 belt, is located around S2-S6 and is linked to a previously reported structure in V(s) tomography. This low-\u03a8 (highly porous) belt is probably a horizontal conduit/reservoir of geothermal fluid. A vertical, low-\u03c3 and high-\u03a8 channel beneath triangle S1-S3-S4 corresponds to a high-attenuation, dome-like feature. We propose an upwell-and-spread magma intrusion model for the last major magmatism in the Coso region. The magmatic upwelling is centered in the S1-S3-S4 area. The model predicts potential geothermal resources to the south and west of triangle S1-S3-S4 based on local faulting patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

This paper discusses the problems associated with calculating external wind speed from measurement of airflow rates within a fixed sampler tube. It is necessary to be able to compensate for anomalous flow regimes within the sampler system, which can arise from changes to the external wind direction.

        "Absrtact": "The de minimis concept acknowledges a human exposure threshold value for chemicals below which there is no significant risk to human health. It is the underlying principle for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation on substances used in food-contact articles. Further to this, the principle of Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) has been developed and is now used by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in their evaluations. Establishing an accepted TTC would benefit consumers, industry and regulators, since it would preclude extensive toxicity evaluations when human intakes are below such threshold, and direct considerable time and cost resources towards testing substances with the highest potential risk to human health. It was questioned, however, whether specific endpoints that may potentially give rise to low-dose effects would be covered by such threshold. In this review, the possibility of defining a TTC for chemical substances present in the diet was examined for general toxicity endpoints (including carcinogenicity), as well as for specific endpoints, namely neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity and developmental toxicity. For each of these endpoints, a database of specific no-observed-effect levels (NOELs) was compiled by screening oral toxicity studies. The substances recorded in each specific database were selected on the basis of their demonstrated adverse effects. For the neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity databases, it was intended to cover all classes of compounds reported to have either a demonstrated neurotoxic or developmentally neurotoxic effect, or at least, on a biochemical or pharmacological basis were considered to have a potential for displaying such effects. For the immunotoxicity endpoint, it was ensured that only immunotoxicants were included in the database by selecting most of the substances from the Luster et al. database, provided that they satisfied the criteria for immunotoxicity defined by Luster. For the developmental toxicity database, substances were selected from the Munro et al. database that contained the lowest NOELs retrieved from the literature for more than 600 compounds. After screening these, substances showing any effect which could point to developmental toxicity as broadly defined by the US were recorded in the database. Additionally, endocrine toxicity and allergenicity were addressed as two separate cases, using different approaches and methodology. The distributions of NOELs for the neurotoxicity, developmental neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity endpoints were compared with the distribution of NOELs for non- specific carcinogenic endpoints. As the immunotoxicity database was too limited to draw such a distribution of immune NOELs, the immunotoxicity endpoint was evaluated by comparing immune NOELs (or LOELs - lowest-observed- effect levels - when NOELs were not available) with non-immune NOELs (or LOELs), in order to compare the sensitivity of this endpoint with non- specific endpoints. A different methodology was adopted for the evaluation of the endocrine toxicity endpoint since data currently available do not permit the establishment of a clear causal link between endocrine active chemicals and adverse effects in humans. Therefore, this endpoint was analysed by estimating the human exposure to oestrogenic environmental chemicals and evaluating their potential impact on human health, based on their contribution to the overall exposure, and their estrogenic potency relative to endogenous hormones. The allergenicity endpoint was not analysed as such. It was addressed in a separate section because this issue is not relevant to the overall population but rather to subsets of susceptible individuals, and allergic risks are usually controlled by other means (i.e. labelling) than the Threshold of Toxicological Concern approach. However, as several researchers are currently examining the existence of a threshold in allergy, the possibility of determining threshold doses for food allergens was put into perspective, and the likelihood for chemical substances to induce allergy at dietary relevant doses was discussed. The analysis indicated that, within the limitation of the databases, developmental neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity were not more sensitive than other non-specific endpoints. Although the cumulative distribution of NOELs for neurotoxic compounds was significantly lower than those for other non-cancer endpoints, these substances were accommodated within the TTC of 1.5\u03bcg/person/day. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that none of the specific non-cancer endpoints evaluated in the present study was more sensitive than cancer and, that a TTC of 1.5\u03bcg/person/day based on cancer endpoints provides an adequate margin of safety. Analysis of the immunotoxicity database showed that for the group of immunotoxicants examined here, the specific immunotoxic endpoint was not more sensitive than other endpoints. In other words, the distribution of immunotoxic NOELs for these compounds did not appear to differ from the distribution of non-specific endpoints NOELs for the same compounds. The dietary intakes of environmental oestrogenic chemicals were estimated and their oestrogenic potencies were compared with that of endogenous hormones, in order to assess their impact on human health. The results are in line with scientific data obtained so far, suggesting that estrogenic compounds of anthropogenic origin, in comparison with endogenous hormones, possess only little hormonal activity like phytoestrogens. Results of animal studies do not suggest that hormonal effects are to be expected from the rather low concentrations found in foods. More data are necessary to determine threshold doses for food allergens. However, provided that numerous criteria need to be satisfied before sensitization occurs, it is unlikely that small molecules used in little amounts in foods would induce such reactions. On the basis of the present analysis, which was conducted using conservative assumptions at each step of the procedure (i.e. in data compilation and data analysis), and continually adopting a 'worst case' perspective, it can be concluded that a Threshold of Toxicological Concern of 1.5\u03bcg/person/day provides adequate safety assurance. Chemical substances present in the diet that are consumed at levels below this threshold pose no appreciable risk. Moreover, for compounds which do not possess structural alerts for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, further analysis may indicate that a higher Threshold of Toxicological Concern may be appropriate.

Abiotic damage (wind, snow, frost or edaphic factors) was present on 8.4% of forest land, on 1.68 million hectares during 1986-1994. It decreased the silvicultural quality of the stand in 5.2% of forest land. Abiotic damage was more frequent in northern than in southern Finland. Especially snow damage was important in northern Finland in Scots pine stands. The defoliation of conifers and various damage forms showed significant co-occurrence. Temporal and spatial patterns were evident in the occurrence and importance of different causal agents. Abiotic damage increased the defoliation in Picea abies more than in Pinus sylvestris, but in the latter species the damage was locally more severe. Sudden changes in defoliation were related to abiotic and biotic damage, and the effect of these injuries can be so remarkable that they mask the possible trend in defoliation. The analysis of these injuries may aid monitoring of forest condition by simplifying interpretation of national and regional patterns of forest damage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The answer is usually heavily dependent on several factors that \"define\" the specific implementation in question--consequently, the answer is one comprised of a number of interrelated factors or components. In order to facilitate this answer process, this paper attempts to identify these individual answer components. At the very least, this will help simplify the process of answering future questions by referring to the components outlined herein. At most, in addition to providing a reference compendium for others, it will assist in increasing the solution implementation success rate by exploring the problem definition in detail: The first step in solving a problem is to have it fully articulated.",

        "Absrtact": "Global epicentre maps show that the majority of earthquakes are inter-plate, although moderate to large earthquakes do occur intra-plate, i.e. within the plates. The seismicity of the Australian continent is typical of intra-plate environments and a magnitude ML 6 earthquake has an average return period of about 5 years. Recordings of Australian intra-plate earthquakes are investigated here to characterise their frequency content, peak acceleration and duration. Due to lack of quality strong motion records of large intra-plate earthquakes at short distances, synthetic seismograms are commonly used for testing structural behaviour. An empirical Green's Function method (Geophys. Res. Lett. 5 (1978), 1-4: Proceedings of the Third International Microzonation Conference, Seattle, USA. vol. 1. (1982). pp. 447-458.) is chosen to simulate a large earthquake by summation in time of a number of smaller earthquakes or sub-events, each given a slightly different origin time to represent more realistically the propagation of a rupture along an assumed fault plane. In the first instance, recordings on rock of the magnitude ML 2.3 aftershock of the 29 December 1989 Newcastle earthquake were used as sub-events to simulate the main shock of magnitude ML 5.6. Validation studies for events recorded elsewhere in Australia are also considered. The response spectra of such synthetic events will be compared with the recommended spectra developed empirically from a statistical analysis of strong motion data for magnitude 5.4-6.5 intra-plate earthquakes recorded in other parts of the world and normalised to a peak ground velocity of 50 mm/s which is typical for a return period of 500 years in Australia (Australasian Structural Engineering Conference, Auckland. New Zealand. (1998). pp. 439-444.). Preliminary results from this comparison with the response spectra recommended for the Building Code of Australia show that the synthetic waveforms produced by this method are realistic and can be used to represent ground motion during typical Australian intra-plate earthquakes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "Absrtact": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the characteristics and outcomes of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiogenic shock (CS) caused by rupture of the ventricular free wall or tamponade versus shock from other causes. BACKGROUND: Free-wall rupture is a recognized cause of mortality in patients with acute MI. Some of these patients present subacutely, which provides an opportunity for intervention. Recognition of factors that distinguish them from the overall shock cohort would be beneficial. METHODS: The international SHOCK Trial Registry enrolled patients concurrently with the randomized SHOCK Trial. Thirty-six centers consecutively enrolled all patients with suspected CS after MI, regardless of trial eligibility. RESULTS: Of the 1,048 patients studied, 28 (2.7%) had free-wall rupture or tamponade. These patients had less pulmonary edema, less diabetes, less prior MI, and less prior congestive heart failure (all p < 0.05). They more often had new Q waves in two or more leads (51.9% vs. 31.5%, p < 0.04), but MI location and time to shock onset after MI did not differ. Of patients with rupture or tamponade, 75% had pericardial effusions. No hemodynamic characteristics identified patients with rupture/tamponade. Most patients with rupture/tamponade had surgery and/or pericardiocentesis (27/28); their in-hospital survival rate was identical to that of the group overall (39.3%). Women and older patients with rupture/tamponade tended to survive intervention less often. CONCLUSIONS: Free-wall rupture and tamponade may present as CS after MI, and survival after intervention is similar to that of the overall shock cohort. All patients with CS after MI should have echocardiography in order to detect subacute rupture or tamponade and initiate appropriate interventions. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.",

To further map the neural network associated with chronic pain, we used positron emission tomography (PET) to determine significant regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes in a patient with chronic facial pain. The patient is implanted with a chronic stimulation electrode in the left ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus with which he can completely suppress his chronic pain. The patient was scanned in the following conditions: before thalamic stimulation (pain, no stimulation), during thalamic stimulation (no pain, stimulation) and after successful thalamic stimulation (no pain, no stimulation). Comparing baseline scans during pain with scans taken after stimulation, when the patient had become pain-free, revealed significant rCBF increases in the prefrontal (Brodmann areas (BA) 9, 10, 11 and 47) and anterior insular cortices, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray associated with the presence of chronic pain. No significant rCBF changes occurred in thalamus, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, BA 24'. Significant rCBF decreases were observed in the substantia nigra/nucleus ruber and in the anterior pulvinar nucleus. During thalamic stimulation, blood flow significantly increased in the amygdala and anterior insular cortex. These data further support that there are important differences in the cerebral processing of acute and chronic pain. (C) 2000 International Association for the Study of Pain.",

In order to improve exposure-assessment and cancer risk estimates, we are developing an ultrasensitive procedure for the detection of carcinogen-DNA adducts. The method is based upon postlabeling of carcinogen-DNA adducts by acetylation with 14C-acetic anhydride combined with quantitation of 14C by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). For this purpose, adducts of benzo[a]pyrene-r-7,t-8-dihydrodiol-t-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) with DNA and deoxyguanosine (dG) were synthesized. The most promutagenic adduct of BPDE, 7R,8S,9R-trihydroxy-10S-(N2-deoxyguanosyl)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPdG), was HPLC purified and structurally characterized. Postlabeling of the BPdG adduct with acetic anhydride yielded a major product with a greater than 60% yield. The postlabeled adduct was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as pentakis(acetyl) BPdG (AcBPdG). Postlabeling of the BPdG adduct with 14C-acetic anhydride yielded a major product coeluting with an AcBPdG standard. Quantitation of the 14C-postlabeled adduct by AMS promises to allow detection of attomolar amounts of adducts. The method is now being optimized and validated for use in human samples.

Crystal shape correlates directly with the relative growth rates of the various faces. By studying cases of known structures in which crystal shape varies systematically with some solution parameter (pH, ionic strength, concentration of a specific solute, etc.), it is sometimes possible to correlate that parameter with its effect on a particular crystal contact. Such correlations provide the basis for models of how solution parameters affect protein-protein interactions. We have applied this technique in a model system involving a subtilisin BPN' variant. Crystal shape varies systematically with pH and ionic strength, an effect that has been traced to a specific interaction in one crystal contact. Mutation of an Asp sidechain in this contact (to Asn) eliminates the morphology variation effect, confirming the key role of this residue in the observed shape effect, and enabling the mechanism to be placed in a mathematical framework.",

Paper birch, which formed the dominant overstory following the 1961 fire, had normal distributions of height and diameter classes. Subalpine fir, which dominated the understory, had the reverse J-shaped height and diameter distributions that are expected of a shade tolerant, climax species. Paper birch grew more than three times the height of subalpine fir. Growing in the summer shade of the birch, subalpine fir had slow but steady height growth during the first 10-15 years, after which height growth declined somewhat. Allometric equations, relating dry weight of foliage, branches, stemwood, stembark, roots, and total biomass to diameter at breast height (DBH), were developed to estimate above- and below-ground biomass. Total biomass of paper birch reached 83.2 t ha-1, while subalpine fir biomass was 26.7 t ha-1. Subalpine fir allocated more biomass to foliage and branches compared to paper birch. Foliage of paper birch had higher nutrient concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg than subalpine fir foliage. Branches and stembark of subalpine fir had higher P, and Ca concentrations than paper birch. Subalpine fir branches contained more of all examined nutrients than paper birch branches. This is a significant component in nutrient cycling of the mixed-species forest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Many current vegetation-atmosphere models require structural information describing the canopy in order to calculate rates of mass and energy exchange. One of the most important pieces of information is the variation with height in leaf area density, p (m2 leaf area per m3 canopy volume), but it is notoriously difficult to measure this in forest canopies. Consequently, very few data on p exist for tall tropical forests. We describe a relatively rapid photographic method to make this measurement and we demonstrate its use for a rain forest in Cameroon, and two rain forests in Brazil. The method requires an assumption or knowledge of leaf angle distribution, but is relatively rapid and has the benefit of sampling a relatively large volume of canopy. The technique works adequately, especially if the leaf area index of the site is already known; the results agree quantitatively and qualitatively with previous more laborious determinations.

The efficacy of MWT on both chlorine consumption and on the inactivation of the key sewage indicator micro-organism Escherichia coli has been evaluated. In addition, the effect on the formation of the key disinfection by-products of chloramines and trichloromethane has been studied. On the basis of a factorial experimental plan, it was found that chlorine loss was significantly suppressed by MWT. The E. coli kill rate for a given disinfectant dose was increased by an average of 25% as an effect of MWT as a result of the enhanced chlorine dissolution. It was also found that MWT reduced chloroform generation to some extent. On the other hand, no statistically significant direct effects on micro-organism deactivation were recorded.",

The Atlantic ocean was a net sink for atmospheric CO2 for all 3 transects. The largest sinks were located at high latitudes, in regions of high wind speed, where strong CO2 undersaturations, associated with high biological activity, were observed. In these regions the partial pressure difference between the ocean and the atmosphere reached -110 \u03bcatm. A CO2 source occurred in the equatorial region between 0\u00b0and 10\u00b0S, where \u0394pCO2 of up to 40 \u03bcatm was found. Another source was in the northern subtropical gyre where its extension varied according to the season. Along the whole transect the October cruises exhibited similar pCO2 distributions suggesting a dominance of the seasonal variability and small year to year changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "The role of external beam irradiation (EBT) combined with transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy (TIPPB) remain undefined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of EBT when combined with TIPPB in a retrospective, matched-pair analysis. Between September 1992 and January 1997, 605 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent TIPPB. Patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels \u226410, Gleason scores \u22646, and stage \u2264T2a underwent TIPPB alone using I-125 and Pd-103 [160 Gy (pre-TG-43) and 120 Gy, respectively]. Combined EBT and TIPPB was offered to patients with a PSA level >10 and/or Gleason score >6. From this cohort, a matched-pair analysis was performed to better assess the role of EBT and TIPPB (n = 215). PSA relapse-free survival was based on the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology Consensus Panel definition. Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival curves were compared to assess various prognostic factors. The median follow-up for all 215 matched patients was 44 months (range, 24-81) with an actuarial PSA relapse-free survival (RFS) at 5 years of 81.1%. Patients treated with EBT and TIPPB had a 5-year PSA RFS of 83.5% whereas patients treated with TIPPB only had a 5-year PSA RFS of 79.4% (p = 0.715). There was no difference in outcome between groups with regard to Gleason score groupings or PSA \u226410 ng/ml or >10 ng/ml. Risk group analysis combining PSA, Gleason score, and stage failed to identify any risk group for which the addition of EBT was significant. Analysis of postimplant dosimetry using the dose to 90% of the prostate volume (D90) failed to distinguish any difference between groups. A significant advantage for combining EBT and TIPPB could not be demonstrated in this retrospective matched-pair analysis. These data indicate that the role and rationale of combined treatment in prostate brachytherapy requires better clarification, with a prospective randomized trial.

The aim was to test the predictive value of the environmental variables and to obtain models that describe the relationships between catches and environmental factors. All environmental variables had a significant relation with Cpue and condition, but the relations of the environmental variables to mean length were weak and mostly insignificant. When using data for the whole time period, the maximum temperature was the best predictor of Cpue. Of the hydrological factors, total river inflow had the highest regression coefficient. The data were split into two 11-year periods (1975-1985 and 1986-1996) in order to test the predictor models. Except for the Zambezi river inflow variable, estimates of Cpue for 1986-1996 using the 1975-1985 model were not significantly different from the observed Cpue. Cross-correlation showed a 5-7 year half cycle in the trend of catches, temperature and the hydrological factors that may be useful for Cpue forecasts.",

METHODS: From a group of 53 glaucoma patients experienced in visual field testing, we identified one eye, randomly chosen, from each of 25 glaucoma patients whose condition was found to be stable, based on both standard and short-wavelength automated perimetry visual field criteria. On each of three visits during a period of up to 3 months, each patient performed one standard and one short-wavelength automated perimetry 24-2 visual field in a random order on a Humphrey visual field analyzer. The long-term variability (also referred to as test-retest variability) was defined as the SD of the three threshold decibel values at each test location. The long-term variability for each test point (mean \u00b1 SD) was determined separately for both standard visual fields and short- wavelength automated perimetry. RESULTS: With all 52 test locations of the 24-2 field averaged, the global long-term variability, mean (\u00b1 SD) for standard visual fields and short-wavelength automated perimetry was 2.37 \u00b1 2.03 dB (95% confidence interval, 2.26-2.48 dB) and 2.92 \u00b1 2.03 dB (95% confidence interval, 2.81-3.03 dB), respectively (P < .0001). In 16 of the 52 visual field locations, long-term variability on short-wavelength automated perimetry was significantly higher than long-term variability on standard visual fields. In addition, the long-term variability increased with greater distance from the point of fixation for both standard visual fields and short-wavelength automated perimetry. The long-term variability decreased closer to fixation, more for standard visual fields than for short-wavelength automated perimetry. CONCLUSIONS: In a group of stable glaucoma patients, mean long-term variability was 0.55 dB higher for short-wavelength automated perimetry than for standard visual fields. This needs to be taken into consideration when serial visual fields are evaluated for change. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.",

Methods: The role of injuries in physical disability from the early 1980s to 1994 was assessed by reviewing administrative data from the U.S. Army Physical Disability Agency, the Naval Disability Evaluation Board, and the Air Force Physical Disability Division. Information on the number of disability cases reviewed in 1994, the leading causes of disability, and the disposition of each case were examined most closely. Also, information from the Department of Defense on the cost of compensating disability cases was reviewed. Results: Disability generally appears to be significant across the services, ranging from 10 to 30 events per 1000 personnel per year depending on the service. Evidence from the data reviewed indicates that 30% to 50% of disability cases may be due to injury. The leading conditions that bring about board reviews and lifetime compensation appear to be lower back and knee conditions, both commonly thought to be due to injuries. Total direct costs of compensation reached $1.5 billion for fiscal year 1990. Conclusions: While current disability data systems are maintained for administrative and not research purposes, the information available may be valuable for injury surveillance and research and suggests that injury-related disability is a major health and economic burden for the Armed Forces.

Both cases and controls were interviewed by telephone. Results: Logistic regression analyses showed that cases were 2.5 times more likely than controls to have smoked cigarettes [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-5.3], and 2.2 times more likely to have worked in selected occupations, including lawn care, forestry, and maintenance of highway right-of-way areas (CI = 1.2-3.7). These occupations may cause workers to be exposed to pesticides or herbicides. The population attributable risk (PAR) was 53% for having ever smoked cigarettes. Conclusions: The study results suggest that among U.S. men, some nasal cancer may be preventable by avoiding cigarette smoking. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

These parameters are of medical significance as they represent metabolic processes (functioning) occurring within each voxel within an imaged region within the body. Each distribution of activity by time is modelled as a mixture of specified (basis) components. The component distributions are those in a large (spectral) class of specified densities, for instance, exponential decay distributions with specified half-life. We describe the integration of maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction from indirect data with mixture modelling of the original time activity, and assess our ability to determine the distribution of this activity, varying in space and time.",

        "Absrtact": "Stent restenosis constitutes a therapeutic challenge affecting an increasing number of patients. Conventional angioplasty and debulking techniques are currently used in these patients. However, the potential role of a second stent implantation in this setting (stenting the stent) remains unknown. Therefore, 65 consecutive patients (12 women, aged 62 \u00b1 11 years) undergoing stent implantation (42 elective and 23 unplanned) for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (diffuse [>10 mm] in 39 [60%]) were studied. Angiographic success was obtained in all patients. Three patients developed hospital complications: 1 died from refractory heart failure and 2 suffered non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. During follow-up (mean 17 \u00b1 11 months) 1 patient died (noncardiac cause) and only 9 (14%) required target vessel revascularization. Kaplan-Meier event-free survival (freedom from death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization) at 1 year was 84%. Using Cox analysis, patients with unstable symptoms, a short time to stent restenosis, nonelective stenting, and B2-C lesions tended to have poorer prognosis. After adjustment, nonelective stenting was associated (adjusted RR 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 10.3, p = 0.09) with an adverse clinical outcome. On quantitative angiography (core lab) restenosis was found in 13 of 43 patients (30%) (75% of those eligible). Logistic regression analysis identify restenosis length (adjusted RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.14, p = 0.04), and time to restenosis (adjusted RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, p = 0.01) as the only independent predictors of recurrent restenosis. Thus, repeat coronary stenting is a safe and efficacious strategy for the treatment of patients with in-stent restenosis. Both elective and nonelective stenting provide excellent initial results. The long-term clinical and angiographic outcome of these patients is also favorable. Copyright (C) 2000 Excerpta Medica Inc.",

This is attributed in particular to their high consumption of the meat and blubber of marine mammals. In the present study, 180 pregnant women and 178 newborn babies were studied, amounting to 36% of the total number of births in the Disko Bay area during 1994-1996. The pesticides found in the highest concentrations in maternal blood were DDE (4.8 \u03bcg/l wet wt.), trans-nonachlor (1.6 \u03bcg/l) and hexachlorobenzene (1.2 \u03bcg/l) while the total concentration of PCB (Aroclor 1260) was 19.1 \u03bcg/l. Calculated on a lipid basis, concentrations were slightly higher in maternal than in cord blood. The mercury concentrations were 16.8 \u03bcg/l in maternal blood and 35.6 \u03bcg/l in cord blood. In a linear regression analysis, the concentrations of organochlorines, mercury and selenium increased with maternal age. Concentrations of mercury and cadmium increased with the consumption of marine mammals, and cadmium was associated with smoking. The contaminants are potentially toxic for several organ systems but the high concentrations of pollutants have so far not been shown to influence health in Greenland.

With a growing critique of the use of North American frameworks as a basis for the interpretation of business politics in the British city, we make a contribution towards the development of a more theoretically informed account of capital's involvement in local politics in Britain. Our research design takes analysis beyond the confines of what we term a 'state-centred perspective' insofar as we focus on the political behaviour of one key fraction of capital, property, in a range of urban areas in one political system, Scotland. Through the first survey to be conducted in Scotland of the political activities of property agents, the paper draws out conclusions about the extent to which new forms of neo-liberal urban governance are serving to construct an environment within which contemporary property politics are being played out. Our results point to a politically engaged fraction of capital but one which is largely oblivious to the changes in governance taking place around them. In an effort to further understanding property politics, we conclude that more attention needs to be given to capital and its trajectories. In calling for an epistemological shift towards a capital-centred perspective, we conclude that an understanding of property politics might profitably draw upon both a rehabilitated version of neo-Marxist frameworks and more recent institutional perspectives.

Currents and densities in the top 1000 m generally improve by over 50 - 70% after 5 months of sea level assimilation every 15 days. Below 1000 m, an error reduction of up to 50% is achieved. The errors remain low during a further 60-day run without assimilation. Diagnostics for the North Atlantic, the Tropical Pacific and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are shown alongside the global averages. The main problems encountered were in weakly stratified regions of the Antarctic and Arctic seas. A scale selective filter is developed to avoid assimilating scales much larger than the local deformation radius, and this avoids the adverse assimilation effects in the southern oceans.

        "Absrtact": "Fluxes of carbonate and non-carbonate (terrigenous + biogenic siliceous) sediment, back to a maximum of marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, were determined for 54 cores from off eastern New Zealand. Mass accumulation rates (MARs) were derived using dry bulk densities measured directly from fresh cores or, in the case of dry archived samples, on estimates from a density/carbonate relationship. MARs exhibit wide spatial and temporal variability in response to (i) the location of cores relative to the terrigenous source of New Zealand, current pathways and local oceanographic features, and (ii) palaeoclimatic change. For MIS 1-2, non-carbonate accumulated at a high rate between 27 and 18 ka (calendar years), due to an influx of waterborne and aeolian terrigenous detritus together with localised production of biogenic silica under a northward intrusion of subantarctic waters, and an increase in wind-induced upwelling. By 18-12 ka, non-carbonate MARs reduced as winds ameliorated and sea level rose to confine some of the terrigenous load to the continental shelf. The Holocene transgression was accompanied by warmer sea surface temperatures, the formation of coastal and lacustrine sediment traps, and more widespread terrestrial vegetation. These conditions further reduced the deep oceanic non-carbonate flux to levels about half those of glacial periods. In contrast, carbonate MARs were lower in cold periods, reflecting lower productivity, increased dissolution and, in the case of the generally productive waters of Chatham Rise, to redistribution by bottom currents. However, off central New Zealand, carbonate production was higher on the continental margin, possibly because of enhanced upwelling under the strong wind regime of MIS 2. Such localised effects produced glacial carbonate MARs higher than interglacial MIS 1 values. For the rest of the region, carbonate fluxes increased to an early to middle MIS 1 maximum before generally declining in recent times. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "This study continues the examination of a variety of strategies an individual may consider or adopt in response to congestion. It finds further evidence that individuals tend to progress from lower-cost, short-term strategies to higher-cost, longer-term ones as dissatisfaction persists or recurs. There is also a weaker tendency to cycle back to lower-cost strategies, although generally just one tier lower than a previously adopted strategy. Binary logit models of the consideration of each of 15 congestion-response strategies were estimated, as a function of work-, family-, leisure-, and travel-related attitudes, among other explanatory variables. \u03c12 goodness-of-fit measures for these models ranged from .16 to .75. Analysis of the contribution of commute-related variables to the consideration of each strategy found that contribution to be significant in fewer than half of the cases (seven out of 15 strategies). With only one exception, the strategies for which commute variables were significant fell into the higher-cost tiers. Commute variables never contributed more than 11% of a model's explanatory power, and generally much less. While other explanatory variables may also be significant for transportation-related reasons, it is clear that individuals adopt and consider the strategies studied here for many reasons other than congestion relief. Further, the transportation-related reasons for considering these strategies may be intertwined in complex ways with non-transportation reasons. One implication of these findings is that policies designed to change transportation behavior may be less powerful than expected, because reactions are filtered through a variety of other motivations and constraints. An improved understanding of the response to these policies must acknowledge and incorporate the complexity of the choice situation facing the typical individual in modern society. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Sea ice type and ice concentration algorithms utilized OKEAN's two-channel radar and passive microwave data in a linear mixture model based on the measured values of brightness temperature and radar backscatter, together with a priori knowledge about the scattering parameters and natural emissivities of basic sea ice types. OKEAN 01 data and algorithms tended to classify lower concentrations of young or first-year sea ice when concentrations were less than 60%, and to produce higher concentrations of multi-year sea ice when concentrations were greater than 40%, when compared to estimates produced from SSM/I data. Overall, total sea ice concentration maps derived independently from OKEAN 01, SSM/I, and AVHRR satellite imagery were all highly correlated, with uniform biases, and mean differences in total ice concentration of less than four percent (sd<15%).This paper presents methods for classifying Arctic sea ice using both passive and active (2-channel) microwave imagery acquired by the Russian OKEAN 01 polar-orbiting satellite series.

        "Absrtact": "The use of statistical models to predict the likely occurrence or distribution of species is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and wildlife management. Evaluating the predictive performance of models using independent data is a vital step in model development. Such evaluation assists in determining the suitability of a model for specific applications, facilitates comparative assessment of competing models and modelling techniques, and identifies aspects of a model most in need of improvement. The predictive performance of habitat models developed using logistic regression needs to be evaluated in terms of two components: Reliability or calibration (the agreement between predicted probabilities of occurrence and observed proportions of sites occupied), and discrimination capacity (the ability of a model to correctly distinguish between occupied and unoccupied sites). Lack of reliability can be attributed to two systematic sources, calibration bias and spread. Techniques are described for evaluating both of these sources of error. The discrimination capacity of logistic regression models is often measured by cross-classifying observations and predictions in a two-by-two table, and calculating indices of classification performance. However, this approach relies on the essentially arbitrary choice of a threshold probability to determine whether or not a site is predicted to be occupied. An alternative approach is described which measures discrimination capacity in terms of the area under a relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve relating relative proportions of correctly and incorrectly classified predictions over a wide and continuous range of threshold levels. Wider application of the techniques promoted in this paper could greatly improve understanding of the usefulness, and potential limitations, of habitat models developed for use in conservation planning and wildlife management.

        "Absrtact": "Stand structure was studied on thirty 1-ha plots in mature managed and old-growth forest stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) in southern Finland. The forests were classified into three categories (10 plots in each category) according to the age of the dominant spruces and signs of previous cutting: (1) mature managed (95-118 years), (2) overmature managed (124-145 years) and (3) old-growth (129-198 years). The average volume of the living trees was 299 m3/ha in mature, 331 m3/ha in overmature and 396 m3/ha in old-growth stands. The clearest difference in the living stand characteristics between the categories was in the numbers of large pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and deciduous trees, which were both ca. 10 times more frequent in old-growth than in mature stands, and intermediate in overmature stands. The average volume of coarse woody debris (CWD) with a minimum diameter of 5 cm was 14 m3/ha in mature (range 2-28 m3/ha), 22 m3/ha in overmature (7-38 m3/ha) and 111 m3/ha (70-184 m3/ha) in old-growth stands. Stand age and basal area of the cut stumps together explained over 70% of the variation in the volume of CWD. In old-growth forests, ca. 70% of the volume of CWD consisted of logs, 23% of intact dead standing trees and 7% of broken snags. Most of the volume of CWD belonged to the 20-29 and 30-39 cm diameter classes, but the mean proportion of large trunks \u226540 cm was also considerable, 24%. In managed forests man-made CWD, consisting of cut stumps, bolts and logging residues, accounted for an average of 25% of the total volume of CWD. In many cases most of the CWD volume belonged to the small diameter classes, 5-9 and 10-19 cm, and the mean proportion of large trunks was only 8%. We suggest that, considering the low proportion of both old-growth and overmature forests in southern Finland and the long time required for old-growth characteristics to develop, the most efficient short-term management strategy to increase structural diversity and old-growth attributes in managed forests would be to apply harvesting methods retaining the old-growth characteristics (i.e. large living trees, snags and logs) that already exist in overmature and mature stands.

Two allegedly dominant designs, the piston propeller DC3 and the turbofan Boeing 707, are shown to have triggered a scaling trajectory at the level of the respective firms. Along these trajectories different variables have been scaled at different moments in time: this points to the versatility of a dominant design which allows a firm to react to a variety of user needs. Scaling at the level of the industry took off only after subsequently reengineered models were introduced, like the piston propeller Douglas DC4 and the turbofan Boeing 767. The two scaling trajectories in civil aircraft corresponding to the piston propeller and the turbofan paradigm can be compared with a single, less pronounced scaling trajectory in helicopter technology for which we have data during the period 1940-1996. Management and policy implications can be specified in terms of the phases of codification at the firm and the industry level.",

The sapropels are characterized by very high organic carbon contents (up to 30%) which are reported to be the result of both increased productivity and improved preservation. Although the organic matter in the sapropels is mainly of marine origin, the \u03b4 13 C(org) values and C/N ratios appear 'terrestrial'. This is the result of anaerobic organic matter degradation which preferentially removed nitrogen- and 13 C-rich organic components. A comparison with Ti/Al profiles, which mimic the precession index, and a calculation of organic carbon accumulation rates indicate that sedimentation rates were at most 30% lower or at most 50% higher during sapropel formation. Thus, sapropel formation lasted from between 2000 and 10,000 years at Site 964 to between 4500 and 12,000 years at Site 967. A synthesis of new data and a comparison with existing models indicates that productivity, which increased due to extra nutrients supplied as a result of winter mixing and as a result of enhanced input by the Nile, was the driving mechanism behind sapropel formation. The resulting sapropel formation was simultaneous at different depths, but lasted longer in the part of the basin closest to the Nile. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A comparison of high-MgO magmas from both oceanic and continental settings reveals that they exhibit wide variations in their bulk-rock contents of FeO* (9-16 wt% at 15 wt% MgO). The high-FeO* picrites (ferropicrites) range from Archean to recent in age but are relatively rare at the Earth's surface, typically forming thin isolated flows near the base of thick lava piles in large igneous provinces. They are characterised by high contents of compatible trace elements (e.g. Cr = 400-1650 parts per million (ppm) and Ni = 250-1050 ppm) and unaltered samples (Parana-Etendeka and Madagascar) have relatively smooth, normalised multi-element patterns that lack significant relative enrichments in strongly incompatible elements (e.g. [Ba/La](n) = 0.5-1.0) and [La/Nb](n) = 1.2-1.4). The ferropicrites are distinguished from other picritic rocks (e.g. Deccan, Hawaii, West Greenland) by their relatively low abundances of Al2O3 (~ 10 wt%) and heavy rare-earth elements (HREEs, e.g. Lu = < 10Xchondrite). They have 87Sr/86Sr(i) ratios of ~ 0.7048 and \u03b5(Nd) values of ~ +4 that are comparable to those of ocean-island basalts. Modelling calculations of combined Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios indicate that some of the ferropicrites may have assimilated upper or lower crust but this appears to have had little effect on major element abundances. The high-FeO* contents of world-wide ferropicrites, relative to 'normal' picrites, cannot simply be attributed to variations in degrees of partial melting and/or depth of melt segregation of an anhydrous lherzolite mantle source. Quantitative partition modelling suggests that the contributing parental melts of the ferropicrites were derived by adiabatic decompression melting of a mantle source that was similar in composition to experimentally studied Fe-rich peridotite PHN1611. The parental melts of the Parana-Etendeka ferropicrites appear to have been generated by ~ 10% partial melting, at high pressures (45-35 kbar) and high mantle potential temperatures (T(p) = 1550\u00b0C). The relatively low volume of world-wide ferropicrites and their association with igneous rocks of 'normal' FeO* contents in mantle plume-related igneous provinces suggest that the former may be derived from Fe-rich streaks in mantle plume starting-heads.",

It is probably the first time that such prominent and significant erosive channel structures have been imaged so clearly and described on seismic reflection data from onshore UK. Similar stratal geometries observed in the Chalk at crop are interpreted as channels formed by submarine erosion and redeposition, during relative sea-level falls. We interpret the structures described here as of primary syndepositional submarine erosion of the Chalk, producing channels, the infill to which may be slumped. Eustatic global sea-level changes are often cited as the cause of anomalous Chalk thicknesses and structures. Increasingly, however, such features are being linked to syndepositional tectonics which were clearly affecting Chalk deposition in surrounding basins. The structures described here may provide important information in the debate about whether late Cretaceous tectonics locally contributed to sea-level changes which affected Chalk sedimentation in the Anglo-Paris Basin, and that considering just one external control (such as eustasy) is oversimplified.",

        "Absrtact": "The knowledge of the primordial deuterium to hydrogen ratio provides one of the most reliable tests of the early Universe nucleosynthesis models and a direct estimate of the cosmic baryon density. Evaluations have been traditionally made using D/H estimations in the interstellar medium, extrapolated backwards in time with the use of galactic evolution models. Direct primordial D/H measurements have been carried out only recently in the direction of quasars. These measurements of deuterium abundances along with observations made in the solar system and in the interstellar medium are presented. New results that indicate spatial variations of the deuterium abundance in the interstellar medium at the level of \u223c 50% over scales possibly as small as \u223c 10 pc, may question our global vision of deuterium evolution until the causes for the origin of these variations are understood. With a conservative point of view, observations thus suggest that the primordial D/H value should be within the range 1. \u00d7 10-5 -3. \u00d7 10-4, leading to a relatively low baryon content Universe. Since the actual evolution of deuterium from primordial nucleosynthesis to now is not known in details, more observations, hopefully to be made with the Hubble Space Telescope, FUSE the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (launched in 1999), or from the ground with the largest telescopes (Keck, VLT, ...), should reveal the evolution of that key element, and better constrain its primordial abundance.",

        "Absrtact": "Concentrations of reducible trace metals (available to hydroxylamine hydrochloride-acetic acid; HA) have been determined in sediments from contrasting estuaries around the United Kingdom; specifically, estuaries receiving contemporary anthropogenic inputs from catchments which are urbanized and industrialized to varying degrees (Clyde, Dee, Forth, Loughor, Mersey and Poole Harbour), and estuaries receiving inputs from mineralized catchments where working of sulphidic ore deposits was important in the past (Fal, Hayle, Helford and Tavy). Mean estuarine ratios of Fe:Mn ranged from less than 10 (Dee, Mersey, Loughor) to about 100 (Fal, Poole Harbour); inter-estuarine variations in the mass contributions of Fe and Mn were attributed to differences in geological and hydrological catchment characteristics, while intra-estuarine variations were attributed to local differences in hydraulic sorting of sediment and redox conditions. The relative contributions of hydrous Fe and Mn oxides to the accumulation of trace metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn) was evaluated by applying different regression analyses to each estuarine dataset. Overall, the most significant correlations were with Fe, and in estuaries draining mineralized catchments where well-defined contaminant metal sources exist; poor correlations in other cases were related to the dissolution of additional metal-bearing phases, including carbonates, by the digest (Dee, Loughor), or the inability of low energy environments (Clyde, Poole Harbour) to buffer the impacts of local sources of contaminant metals. Mean estuarine concentrations of Pb and Zn ranged from about 25 \u03bcg g-1 (Poole Harbour) to 200 \u03bcg g-1 (Hayle), and 80 \u03bcg g-1 (Forth) to 1500 \u03bcg g-1 (Hayle), respectively. Pooled Pb and Zn data were defined by a single regression equation which was not controlled by the availability or abundance of oxidic material, suggesting common environmental and anthropogenic sources and similar sorptive and post-depositional behaviours for these metals. Pooled Cr and Cu data, however, exhibited distinct groupings which were attributed to the differential sources and sorptive behaviours of these metals. Naturally occurring Cr is highly resistant to the HA digest and excess concentrations above a baseline of about 2\u00b75 \u03bcg g-1, which characterises sediment from mineralized catchments, are the result of contamination from contemporary or historical industrial processes (e.g. mean concentrations in the Clyde and Forth are about 30 \u03bcg g-1). Copper is available to the HA digest in sediments of estuaries draining mineralized catchments, where concentrations, locally, exceed 750 \u03bcg g-1, but is highly resistant to the HA digest in sediments of industrialized estuaries, where concentrations are, typically, between 5 and 40 \u03bcg g-1. This is because Cu derived from the dissolution of sulphidic minerals adsorbs readily to hydrous Fe oxides, while Cu derived from contemporary industrial and municipal sources appears to interact with anthropogenic organic matter and the resulting complexes partition into sediment organic matter which is relatively resistant to the HA digest. Although the HA digest cannot readily resolve geochemical and anthropogenic metals in hydrous oxides (and other sorbents dissolved by HA), the availability of metals like Cr and Cu may give some indication of the history of the contaminant (e.g. its source and subsequent particle-water interaction mechanism). More generally, from a management and assessment standpoint, this approach affords a first-order estimate of contaminant metal loading which is geochemically and biologically available.

A slightly landward dipping interface revealed at 13 km depth by a single previous line in the channel between Cephalonia and Zante has been suggested as the interplate subduction boundary. New marine multichannel reflection profiles and OBS refraction and wide-angle reflection data confirm the reflector as a regional feature. These data evidence its extension to the south, where large, low-angle thrust earthquakes occur offshore to Zante. The new profiles establish a coincidence between the focal depths of these large subduction events and the imaged bright reflective level, confirming its tentative interpretation as the interplate boundary, which generally appears with a positive reflection polarity. In this context, the Ionian Islands outcrop corresponds to a shallowing of the interplate boundary from south to north. In the south, offshore Zante, the interplate boundary comprises a stratified zone that may be considered as the sedimentary cover of the Ionian Basin oceanic-like crust, which forms the lower plate here. The shallower position and single-cycle reflection character of the interplate further north suggest that the lower plate could there be the Apulian paleomargin to that basin. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The choice of the object relational platform offers the (a) flexibility in the choice of a user interface, (b) ability to deal with scalable implementations, and (c) ability to support key aspects of the modelling life cycle via built-in components of the platform.",

        "Absrtact": "Thellier-Thellier paleointensity experiments were conducted on a collection of glasses from three very recent submarine axial flows. Two were erupted along the Juan de Fuca ridge at around 46\u00b0N and one along the East Pacific Rise South at around 18\u00b0S. The within-sample dispersion of paleointensity results from the 'Animal Farm' flow (EPR south) is very low and leads to a well-defined mean value of 35.6\u00b1 1 \u03bcT (95\u2030 error on the mean) based on 11 glass chips from four independent samples. Today's geomagnetic field intensity in the area is 31.2 \u03bcT. Comparing Animal Farm results with published field model reference curves developed for the past 400 yr suggests an eruptive date estimated between 1880 A.D. and 1950 A.D. (taking into account different sources of errors). This is consistent with qualitative evidence for the age of this flow and constitutes the first precise demonstration of using paleointensity as a dating tool for very recent mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). However in the Juan de Fuca area results show a more erratic pattern with samples varying by up to 30\u2030 higher and lower from the expected value of about 55\u03bcT. The dispersion is attributed to the large local crustal magnetic anomalies in this area that can lead to inconsistent intensity values over the same unit. Local magnetic anomalies should thus always be checked when doing paleointensity on MORB samples which should also be distributed as widely as possible in a flow unit. When no significant magnetic anomalies are detected the paleointensity dating tool is anticipated to be especially efficient to investigate the volcanic cyclicity along the EPR axis during the last several hundred years. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In most cases, a great part of the material collected by traps (200 and 540 m depth) was biogenic, opal being the most abundant constituent followed by organic matter. The composition of particles shows a seasonal pattern in the upper trap, which is much less evident at depth. Fluxes showed a marked seasonality due to the presence, in winter, of ice cover. During the sampling period, mass fluxes varied from 0.03 to 120 mg m-2 day-1 and from 24 to 393 mg m-2 day-1 at the upper and bottom level, respectively. Values of 0-64 mg m-2 day-1 of biogenic silica and 0-7.8 mg m-2 day-1 of organic carbon were obtained at 200 m depth. Near-bottom fluxes were almost always much higher: 11-141 and 1.5-19 mg m-2 day-1, respectively. 210Pb fluxes are lower than expected, and this means that particles sink rapidly without reaching an equilibrium with the radiotracer. A mechanism of focusing affects the bottom trap and much more, the seafloor. At site B, we measured particle fluxes that are much lower than those obtained at other locations in the Ross Sea. This can be due to low production and export during the sampling period, and underlies the necessity to further investigate the interannual variability of these processes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We undertook an evaluation of the CDR to understand factors affecting its adoption. Design: We used a theoretical framework that is based on diffusion of innovation theory. Building on validated survey instruments, we developed a questionnaire and conducted interviews of key executive leaders. Fifty-three individuals with logon ids to the CDR completed our questionnaire. Twelve executive leaders were interviewed. Measurements: The outcome variables were the initial and continued use of the CDR. Independent variables included attributes suggested by diffusion theory (i.e. relative advantage, complexity), knowledge and skills expected to correlate with computer usage, and the influence of communication channels. Results: Our overall response rate was 82%. We identified characteristics of users associated with the initial decision to use the CDR. Compatibility with an individual's skills and work style was associated strongly with satisfaction and continued use. Secondly, the importance of organizational culture and the need for data was illuminated by management interviews. Conclusions: We have shown that diffusion of innovation theory can be used to help understand factors contributing to the success of a data warehouse in a healthcare setting. Our results suggest areas for future research and inquiry as the CDR evolves. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.A theoretical framework based on diffusion of innovation theory was used to evaluate the Clinical data repository (CDR) to understand factors affecting its adoption.

        "Absrtact": "A GIS algorithm has been applied to analyse the maximum potential extent that lava flows can reach in order to delimit the areas topographically protected against flow invasion. The algorithm selected makes use of a special kind of spatial analysis functions called neighbourhood operators, in which the outcome depends on the values that one or more specified variables adopt in the surroundings of the element where analysis takes place. Assuming the maximum magnitude hypothesis, potential lava flow invasion areas can be calculated with spatial analysis functions in the context of two propagation regimes: persistent flow lengthening, and a combination of persistent flow lengthening and widening. To define the algorithm behaviour for each regime, a series of simple stochastic rules have been set to establish the way in which lava flow propagation can proceed. The algorithm has been applied on three source areas located in Tenerife Island characterised by their high probability of occurrence of basic effusive events. For each area, maximum potential flow extent has been calculated following both propagation regimes, with the aim of delimiting the areas that would potentially remain out of lava reach. No distance limits have been taken into account to carry out the calculation, as lava has on many occasions reached the coastline either in historic or geologic times. An additional hazard exposure level analysis has been possible in those areas where results indicated that flows could potentially arrive from more than one source. Algorithm performance assessment has been carried out in terms of accuracy by generating a series of 3D views and comparing the algorithm application results with those obtained from stochastic physical model simulation. Although the GIS algorithm applied does not distinguish the probability level of an area being invaded by lava, it has clearly identified on Tenerife the areas which are potentially safe from the flows that could originate at any point located inside or on the margins of each of the source areas considered. This capability can be advantageously used to develop medium-to long-term risk prevention and management measures. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The study of these phenomena therefore needs an accurate representation of the atmosphere/ocean interface generally occupied by the ice pack. With this aim in view, a one-dimensional thermodynamic model based on Semtner's approach associated with a horizontal transport component is used to compute the sea ice thickness and extent. A visco-plastic ice rheology reproduces the ridging of the ice pack. Turbulent surface heat and momentum fluxes over ice and open areas are classically computed. The sea ice and leads are connected to the deep ocean through a mixed layer. The heat and salt fluxes between ice and water column are explicitly taken into account. The model is run with a set of climatological data to reproduce the ice formation during a year and the results are compared with available observations. This work is the first step of a coupled ocean circulation/sea ice model developed for the Southern Ocean. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The pups gradually developed the diving skills necessary to obtain enough food after weaning and to avoid natural and man-made dangers. The maximum dive duration remained unchanged with pup age, indicating that pups have considerable breath-holding capacity already from an early age. However, mean dive duration increased with age, from 0.92 min in pups \u226425 days old to 2.55 min in 1-2 month olds, and 3.09 min in 2-3 month olds. The increase continued for weeks after the assumed weaning, and indicates that the capacity to perform long-lasting dives steadily increases as the pups grow older. Mean and maximum surface duration remained unchanged with pup age. Mean surface duration was 0.32 min with a maximum value of 6.10 min. An increase in mean surface duration with mean dive duration was found when the pups were \u226425 days old, but not when they were older. This may indicate that young pups need to rest more after diving than older ones. No relationship was found between dive duration and the subsequent surface interval. The proportion of time spent submerged increased with age, from 71% when the pups were \u226425 days old to 86% when they were older. The pups hauled-out less frequently as they grew older. The pups were never recorded outside the study area (defined by the 30-km station range). Time of day, tidal height and weather conditions seemed not to influence the diving behaviour of the pups. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A 1.33 ha experimental area at Monaughty forest, northeast Scotland was treated with 200 m3 ha-1 of anaerobically digested sewage sludge. Approximately 400 kg ha-1 of nitrogen (N) and 200 kg ha-1 of phosphorus (P) were applied in the sludge treatment. The hydrological balance and fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus in throughfall and soil drainage water (O1, O2 and Bs soil horizons) over the short (3 month) and longer-term (17 month) period after application are compared with untreated areas. Immediate increases in soluble ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4) were apparent within the organic soil horizons and PO4 in the Bs horizons of sludge-treated areas. This observation was attributed to the direct leaching of nutrients contained within the original liquid phase which constituted 95% (by volume) of the sludge. The late autumn application of sludge which contained only small amounts of nitrate (NO3) (<0.05 kg N ha-1) initially resulted in limited additional mineralisation and consequently little N leached as NO3. Over the longer 17 month period the total fluxes of both N and P from sludge-treated areas remained greater than those of the untreated areas with significant losses as NO3 being detected from the organic and Bs horizons. However, total fluxes of N and P measured in the soil drainage water from the lowest soil horizon, over the whole study period represented 2.5 and <1%, respectively, of the total N and P applied as sludge. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Mineral isochron dating is a frequently used geochronological tool. One of its assumptions is that the minerals grow over a time period that is small compared to the half-life of the radiogenic isotope system used. In recent years, increasing analytical precision has promoted the use of the short-lived U-series isotope system in order to date young crystallisation events. Three whole-rock zircon U-Th isochrons from the 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, yield pre-eruptive model ages of 5.5 \u00b1 0.8 ka, 9.7 \u00b1 1.7 ka and 12.3 \u00b1 0.8 ka for the sub-63 \u03bcm. 63-125 \u03bcm and 125-250 \u03bcm zircon size fractions, respectively. This suggests that in this case the assumption of instantaneous crystal growth breaks down. Instead, the U-Th data may be explained by continuous zircon growth over a period of e190 ka. However, cathodoluminescence shows that crystals are typically composed of an euhedral core surrounded by a sector-zoned euhedral rim, and the U-Th data can also be modelled by mixing an older (\u039f27 ka model age) population of zircon crystals with a young zircon rim that formed shortly prior to eruption of the Oruanui rhyolite. This indicates that detailed petrographic studies are critical for deciphering the histories of prolonged crystallisation in the magmatic environment. It is concluded that conventional U-series mineral isochrons may underestimate the age of the onset of crystallisation by more than an order of magnitude. In future, microanalytical techniques will lead to significant advances in the understanding of crystallisation processes and timescales. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The eucalypt species studied were:-Narrow-leaved Peppermint (Eucalyptus radiata), Mountain Swamp Gum (Eucalyptus camphora), Mountain Gum (Eucalyptus dalrympleana), Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha), Ribbon Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and, Broad-leaved Peppermint (Eucalyptus dives). E. radiata and E. macrorhyncha supported almost twice the proportion of branch-end hollows than cavities assigned to other categories. Cavities in the main trunk were the predominant hollow class in E. viminalis and E. dalrympleana. Large diameter trees were characterised by more branch-end hollows, whereas main trunk cavities were typically the most prevalent cavity type in smaller diameter stems. We identified a simple, general rule that highlights the relationships between cavities and readily measured tree attributes. Our data show that, in general, both the number of cavities and cavity size were directly proportional to tree diameter, but inversely proportional to the square root of tree height. This proportionality changed between different tree species. E. dives and E. viminalis supported, on average, larger cavities than other species, whereas the cavities in E. macrorhyncha were smaller than the other taxa sampled. This simple general relationship may make it possible to make rapid crude estimates of cavity abundance across large areas of forest by measuring simple tree attributes such as tree diameter and tree height.

        "Absrtact": "The purpose of this paper is to examine the characteristics of community subjects with one or two alcohol dependence symptoms who did not satisfy the criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) alcohol dependence or abuse (sub-diagnostic group or diagnostic orphans). Variables not included in the DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence criteria are used to compare the different alcohol statuses. The results indicate that the sub-diagnostic group 'diagnostic orphans' formed a cluster distinct from that of the non-problem drinkers group, and appeared to be closer to those with alcohol abuse than to those with alcohol dependence. The diagnosis of DSM-IV alcohol dependence (with three, four, or five or more symptoms) appeared to be its own entity. The findings lend credence to the requirement of three symptoms (in any 12 months) for the diagnosis of alcohol dependence in DSM-IV. However, those with one or two symptoms of alcohol dependence should be considered along with alcohol abuse as an entity in future DSM classifications.

The three-dimensional framework structure is built up by GeO4 tetrahedra, connected in such way that they form intersecting 12-ring channels along all three crystallographic axes. This is the first germanate zeotype with large intersecting channels. The free diameters of the apertures of the channels are 5.8 by 6.0 angstroms along both the a- and the b-axes and 7.4 angstroms along the c-axis.

        "Absrtact": "The electronic nose (EN) is an instrumented chemical sensor array with pattern recognition. ENs with open architectures, such as the MOSES II system, can be readily modified to accommodate a wide range of samples, sensors, and methods. Three specific ways to make the EN more versatile and improve the analytical capability have been developed, installed on the MOSES II system, and evaluated. First, the array of quartz crystal microbalance (QMB) and SnO2 heated metal oxide (MOX) sensors has been expanded to include amperometric gas sensors (AGS). This expands the chemical independence of the sensor responses, increases the analytical chemical information produced by the array, and improves the capability for qualitative and quantitative analysis with the EN. Second, we have incorporated a membrane separator into the sampling system which improves analysis capability especially on sensors that are sensitive to water vapor. Third, we have incorporated a heated noble metal filament into the inlet that thermally decomposes or reacts either gas, liquid, or solid samples to generate gaseous molecules that are derivatives of the sample and may be more/less reactive on the sensors. The filament often produces improved sensitivity and selectivity for specific analytes. Examples are presented of identification of cheeses and explosives, and the detection of bacterial growth. The data illustrate how each of these instrument modifications and newly developed methods can improve the EN by adding either sensors with complementary information or methods of sample pretreatment that enhance analytical performance.",

        "Absrtact": "Applications in engineering manufacture, such as dimensional inspection, often require triangulation of large sets of measured 3D data. The CAD models of relevant complex parts are usually defined using trimmed NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline). With such situations in mind, the paper proposes a new triangulation procedure which achieves high efficiency and robustness by utilising the CAD model as an available 2D manifold which approximates the shape of the actual part. The steps in this procedure are alignment between the data and the model, registration of the measured points to the model entities, triangulation in the R2 domain provided by the parametric surface entities, 3D mesh improvement, stitching of mesh patches and smoothing of the final mesh. The method does not assume any prior knowledge about the point ordering and performs well in the presence of the measurement noise, while also bypassing the problems of occlusion and overlap that are commonly associated with range imaging. The performance of the proposed method was analysed in relation to some other methods using models of real engineering parts. The results are highly encouraging, leading to a conclusion that the methods is well suited to practical engineering applications.",

The SPICE excursion is documented from sections in Laurentia, Kazakhstan, China, and Australia where it begins with the mass extinction at the base of the Pterocephaliid Biomere (Steptoean Stage) in Laurentia and at coeval extinction horizons in Gondwana and periGondwana terranes. The peak of SPICE (+ 5%0) coincided with a time of maximum regression in Laurentia. SPICE is similar in this regard to excursions that coincide with glacio-eustatic falls, such as in the Late Ordovician. A plausible scenario involves the transformation of ocean circulation between two states, which led to enhanced coastal upwelling and benthic extinctions. The lack of evidence for glaciation indicates that the coeval sea level fall (Sauk II-Sauk III event) resulted from tectonic or hydrologic changes that remain poorly understood at this time.

        "Absrtact": "Purpose: To investigate the role of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to irradiate the prostate gland and pelvic lymph nodes while sparing critical pelvic organs, and to optimize the number of beams required. Methods and Materials: Target, small bowel, colon, rectum, and bladder were outlined on CT planning scans of 10 men with prostate cancer. Optimized conventional (RT) and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) plans were created and compared to inverse-planned IMRT dose distributions using dose-volume histograms. Optimization of beam number was undertaken for the IMRT plans. Results: With RT the mean percentage volume of small bowel and colon receiving >45 Gy was 21.4 \u00b1 5.4%. For 3D-CRT it was 18.3 \u00b1 7.7% (p = 0.0043) and for 9-field IMRT it was 5.3 \u00b1 1.8% (p < 0.001 compared to 3D- CRT). For 7, 5, and 3 IMRT fields, it was 6.4 \u00b1 2.9%, 7.2 \u00b1 2.8%, and 8.4 \u00b1 3.8% (all p < 0.001 compared to 3D-CRT). The rectal volume irradiated >45 Gy was reduced from 50.5 \u00b1 16.3% (3D-CRT) to 5.8 \u00b1 2.1% by 9-field IMRT (p < 0.001) and bladder from 52.2 \u00b1 12.8% to 7 \u00b1 2.8% (p < 0.001). Similar benefits were maintained for 7, 5, and 3 IMRT fields. Conclusions: The reduction in critical pelvic organ irradiation seen with IMRT may reduce side effects in patients, and allow modest dose escalation within acceptable complication rates. These reductions were maintained with 3-5 IMRT field plans which potentially allow less complex delivery techniques and shorter delivery times. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "There were climatic regime shifts over the North Pacific in 1976 and 1988 which affected the dynamics of the marine ecosystem and fisheries resources in Korean waters. Precipitation in Korean waters showed a decadal scale climatic jump, especially of Ullungdo Island, reflecting the regime shift that occurred in the North Pacific. The variation was also detected in East Asian atmospheric systems. The Aleutian Low and North Pacific High Pressure Systems showed substantial changes in 1976 and around 1987-89. 1976 was an unusually warm year for Korea; mean sea surface temperature (SST) was higher than 'normal' and was accompanied by a northward shift in the thermal front. Post 1976, the volume transport of the Kuroshio Current increased and higher seawater and air temperatures persisted until 1988. Other shifts occurred after 1976 such as an increase in mixed layer depth (MLD) and biological changes in the ecosystem of Korean waters including decreases in spring primary production and an increase in autumn primary production. Primary production increased again after 1988, and was followed by a significant increase in zooplankton biomass after 1991. The 1976 regime shift was manifested by a decreased biomass and production of saury, but an increase in biomass and production of sardine and filefish in Korean waters. After 1988, recruitment, biomass, and production of sardine collapsed while those of mackerel substantially increased. Based on these observations, hypotheses on the relationship between the climate-driven oceanic changes and changes in fisheries resources were developed and are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Purpose: To identify in a multivariate analysis treatment-related factors predisposing patients (pts) with lung cancer to acute esophagitis, expressed as a severity grade or Esophagitis Index (EI). Methods and Materials: Acute esophagitis is prospectively scored as an RTOG Grade in our institution during and after thoracic radiotherapy. Charts, toxicity forms and digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) of all pts with lung cancer who received thoracic radiotherapy (RT) between 11/95 and 1/99 were reviewed. Esophagitis grades for each time point were verified by review of weekly physician and nursing treatment notes, hospital discharge summaries and referring physician notes and then plotted on graph against time. The area under the curve was calculated for each patient's graph and was defined as an Esophagitis Index. The length of esophagus was measured on each anterior DRR while assuming that esophagus overlies the vertebral bodies on the anterior films and projects over the edge of the vertebral body on the oblique DRRs. This assumption was confirmed in 10 pts by digitizing esophagus on CT simulator-derived slices and visualizing its position on DRRs. To compare RT doses delivered with different fractionation schemes to standard fractionated doses, the equivalent RT doses were calculated using the linear-quadratic formula and \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of 10. Univariate and multivariate analyses of several factors potentially influencing the maximum esophagitis grade, as well as EI, were performed. Results: A total of 277 pts were identified. Pts were included in the analysis (n = 105) if they fulfilled the following criteria: chart, toxicity form and DRRs were all available; parallel opposed fields (no multiple fields) were used for both the initial and off cord/cone down fields; and an equivalent dose of 45.0 Gy or more was delivered. Seventy-eight pts had Stage III; 32, Stage IV, and the remainder, Stages I, II, or recurrent lung cancer (85 non-small cell and 18, small cell). Seventy- four pts were treated with definitive intent. Chemotherapy was given concurrently with RT in 58 pts (in 7 pts, with twice daily, or b.i.d., RT) and as induction treatment, in 11. Only 2 pts required a treatment break of more than 1 week. Median total and equivalent RT doses, fraction size, and anterior esophageal length were as follows: 59.9 Gy, 59.9 Gy, 2.0 Gy, and 14 cm (range, 4.2-21). The following maximum grades of esophagitis were recorded: 1, in 54 pts; 2, in 17 pts; 3, in 13 pts, and 4, in 1 pt. The mean EI for all pts; pts treated with standard RT alone; induction chemotherapy and standard RT; concurrent chemotherapy and standard (QD) RT; and b.i.d. RT with concurrent chemotherapy, was 41.5 (range, 0-317); 13.6; 24.5; 52.4; and 132.1, respectively (p < 0.001). Three pts developed an esophageal stricture within 3 months beginning RT. In multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with increasing EI: concurrent chemotherapy with QD RT and concurrent chemotherapy with b.i.d. RT (p < 0.001, considered jointly). Both factors were also associated with increasing maximum esophagitis grade (p = 0.011). Esophageal length was not associated with increasing EI or esophagitis grade in either univariate or multivariate analyses. Conclusion: Concurrent chemotherapy and twice daily radiotherapy, especially if combined together, were associated with the highest acute maximum esophagitis grade and esophagitis index in pts with lung cancer. The duration of acute esophagitis was also longest in the concurrent chemotherapy/twice daily radiotherapy group. Esophagitis Index appeared to be a more sensitive measure of acute esophagitis than the maximum esophagitis grade. The increasing length of esophagus in the radiation field did not predict for the severity of acute esophagitis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "Groundwater table (GWT) class maps have been mapped for the whole of The Netherlands at a scale of 1:50,000, and provide useful information for a variety of purposes. Due to strong human impact on the Dutch landscape, water tables have changed and the maps now need updating. Six updating methods have been defined, varying in data requirements and in the smallest spatial unit that can be updated. The performance and cost of each of the methods were measured in a 9228-ha test area. The costs were also extrapolated to larger areas of 46,994 and 75,684 ha using measures of sampling error as criteria. The major cost factor is largely determined by the sample size, which is method dependent. A method that updates GWT maps by evaluating an objective function in locations obtained through stratified random sampling showed the best performance in the test area and a reasonable cost development at larger areas. Validation in the 75,684 ha area supported this conclusion. A kriging-based method performed well, but was expensive. In the near future, elevation data will be available at the national scale. Using these data as ancillary information will decrease cost and increase the accuracy of GWT map updates. This will allow for drawing new map polygons instead of re-labeling existing ones.

The model was parameterized against needle conductance measurements that were made on 4-6-year-old spruce saplings, grown in open-top chambers, in July-September during three different seasons. The spruce saplings were either maintained well watered or subject to a 7-8 week drought period in July-September each year. The simulated conductance showed a good agreement with the measured conductance for the well-watered as well as the drought stress-treated saplings. The simulations were significantly improved when different vapour pressure deficit (VPD) functions were applied for well-watered and drought-stressed spruce saplings. The cumulated ozone uptake which was calculated from the conductance simulations showed less variation between years, compared to the cumulative ozone exposure index AOT40 (accumulated exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb or nl l-1) for the corresponding time periods. Measurements in May 1995 demonstrated the occurrence of long-term 'memory-effects' from the drought stress treatments on the conductance. Memory-effects need to be considered when simulation models for stomatal conductance are to be applied to long-lived forest trees under a multiple stress situation.

Materials and methods: four criteria were divided into different degrees and evaluated. These include: (A): continuity (non- continuous, continuous); (B): transition zone (absent, gradual, abrupt); (C): prestenotic SB fluid (minimal, about one-fourth, one-half, and three-fourths, nearly complete); and (D): colonic contents (minimal, moderate, considerable). One hundred fifty-three examinations, 86 obstructive and 67 non-obstructive, were analyzed using \u03c72-square tests to determine the relationship of each criterion to the presence of small bowel obstruction (SBO), whether the proportions of various degrees of these criteria differed significantly among the obstructive and non-obstructive subgroups, and to classify the criteria with a tree-based model (calculated by the computer) for the development of a useful decision procedure. Results: in each of the four criteria, the trend of probability of obstruction was statistically significant (P = 0.0000). The proportions of most, except two, of the various degrees of different criteria in the obstructive and non-obstructive subgroups differed significantly (P < 0.01). The obstruction tends to have a continuou dilatation, an abrupt transition, more prestenotic SB fluids, and less colonic contents. The results of classification by a tree-based model were 76 true-positive, ten false-negative, six false-positive, and 61 true- negative. The sensitivity was 88%; specificity was 91%; positive predictive value was 93%; negative predictive value was 86%; and the overall accuracy was 90%. Conclusion: by analyzing the above four criteria together, a useful tree-based model can be developed and utilized as a supplemental decision procedure for the differentiation of obstructive from non-obstructive SB dilatation. The accuracy can be further promoted if the factor of a recognized pathologic condition is taken into consideration.

A total of 153 examinations were analyzed using \u03c72-square tests to determine the relationship of each criterion to the presence of small bowel obstruction (SBO). The results indicate the possibility of developing and using a useful tree-based model as a supplemental decision procedure for the differentiation of obstructive from non-obstructive SB dilatation.",

Previously we demonstrated the importance of trapped entanglements in determining the elastic and relaxational properties of networks. Here, we present new results for the stress versus strain for both dry and swollen networks. Models which limit the fluctuations of the network strands like the tube model are shown to describe the stress for both elongation and compression. For swollen networks, the total modulus is found to decrease like (V0/V)2/3 and goes to the phantom model result only for short strand networks.",

The comparison clearly indicates the superiority of polarizable over (simply) flexible water models to properly describe structure and polarization (enhancement of the molecular dipole over that of the monomer).

New prediction equations were developed for 72 subclasses of days in milk, parity, and season of calving for each of 18 possible three-times-a-day testing schemes and for each of four possible two-times-a-day testing schemes. The prediction equations were compared to current official factors and found to be slightly better than the official factors. For two-times-a-day testing schemes the accuracies of 24 h fat yield predictions from one milk weight and one fat and protein determination were 0.88 for an evening milking and 0.89 for a morning milking. For three-times-a-day milkings the accuracies of 24 h fat and protein yields from two milk weights with fat and protein contents on each were 0.91-0.94 depending on which two of the three milkings were observed. If only one of three milkings were recorded, then accuracies of 24 h predicted fat and protein yields dropped to 0.80-0.82. More data from herds milking three-times-a-day are needed on all breeds.

        "Absrtact": "Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is widely accepted as the reference method for the diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis and for assessment of fracture risk, especially at the hip. However, axial-DXA is not suitable for mass screening, because it is usually confined to specialized centers. We propose a two-step diagnostic approach to postmenopausal osteoporosis: the first step, using an inexpensive, widely available screening technique, aims at risk stratification in postmenopausal women; the second step, DXA of spine and hip is applied only to potentially osteoporotic women preselected on the basis of the screening measurement. In a group of 110 healthy postmenopausal women, the capability of various peripheral bone measurement techniques to predict osteoporosis at spine and/or hip (T-score < -2.5SD, using DXA) was tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves: radiographic absorptiometry of phalanges (RA), ultrasonometry at calcaneus (QUS.CALC), tibia (SOS.TIB), and phalanges (SOS.PHAL). Thirty-three women had osteoporosis at spine and/or hip using DXA. Areas under the ROC curves were 0.84 for RA, 0.83 for QUS.CALC, 0.77 for SOS.PHAL (p < 0.04 vs RA), and 0.74 for SOS.TIB (p < 0.02 vs RA and p = 0.05 vs QUS.CALC). For a level of sensitivity of 90%, the respective specificities were 67% (RA), 64% (QUS.CALC), 48% (SOS.PHAL), and 39% (SOS.TIB). In cost-effective two-step strategy, the price of the first step should not exceed 54% (RA), 51% (QUI.CALC), 42% (SOS.PHAL), and 25% (SOS.TIB), respectively, of the cost of DXA of hip and spine. In conclusion, RA, QUS.CALC, SOS.PHAL, and SOS.TIB may be useful to preselect postmenopausal women in whom axial DXA is indicated to confirm/exclude osteoporosis at spine or hip.",

        "Absrtact": "The potential effects of future climate change were investigated, corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm, on agricultural production of four different cropping systems at two Italian locations, Modena and Foggia. Climate change scenarios, derived from two general circulation models (GCMs), were used as weather input to a soil-plant growth simulator, CropSyst. This model was recently modified to include the effects of elevated CO2 on crop photosynthesis and transpiration. Six different crops in total were simulated at the two Italian sites. At Modena, a 3-year maize-maize-wheat rotation and a 2-year soybean-barley-summer sorghum rotation were studied. At Foggia, a 2-year sunflower-wheat-fallow rotation, and a 2-year wheat-fallow-spring sorghum rotation were simulated. Results suggested that the combined effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change at both sites would depress crop yields if current management practices were not modified. Specifically, predicted warmer air temperatures accelerated plant phenology, reducing dry matter accumulation and crop yields by 10-40%. By investigating adaptation strategies, it was found that a combination of early planting for spring-summer crops and the use of slower-maturing winter cereal cultivars succeeds in maintaining crop yields at current levels at both sites. For irrigated maize and soybean production at Modena, 60-90% more irrigation water was required under climate change to keep grain yields at current levels. This implies that adaptation to climate change may be limited for irrigated crops, depending on site-specific water availability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The document emphasised the need for joined-up policy thinking and for co-ordinated action across different areas of government, a theme that has been taken up in many subsequent policy documents issued by central government. The paper explores the extent to which 'joined-up thinking' is evident in practice, both in the ways in which transport measures are appraised (e.g. do they fully take into account non-transport impacts?), and in appraisals in other policy areas with significant transport impacts. It does so by examining appraisal frameworks in different sectors, and identifies a number of current weaknesses. It then builds on these examples to propose ways in which an integrated policy appraisal framework could be developed. This would aim to identify not only the comparative cost-effectiveness of different transport measures in fulfilling policy objectives, but also the relative contribution that different areas of government could make-including transport-to the delivery of over-arching policy objectives, such as sustainable development, social exclusion and regeneration. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many of the MR imaging methods that have been developed for cardiovascular imaging are now mature and available on state-of-the-art scanners. Although MR imaging can provide detailed characterization of diastolic function, there is a paucity of clinical results which could lead to use guidelines. When more clinicians have access and become familiar with MR imaging, and the type of information that it can provide, clinical trials will be needed to establish the role of MR imaging for evaluation of diastolic function. In the meantime, MR imaging remains an excellent research tool for this application and will help yield further insights into the pathophysiology of diastolic dysfunction.",

        "Absrtact": "This paper proposes a stochastic application of a deterministic model (LEACHN) with the aim of forecasting the probability of exceeding given nitrate leaching levels for different cropping systems and soil hydrological characteristics. The understanding of the level of probability associated to the prediction of leaching is an important criteria for the judgement of cropping systems. After calibration of organic matter mineralization and nitrification rates in both a sandy-loam and a loamy soil of the Western Po river valley (Northern Italy), LEACHN was used as a stochastic tool to evaluate the meteorological variability and the spatial variability of hydrological parameters of a soil. Meteorological variability was generated using series of measured air temperature, rainfall and global radiation for a period of at least 15 years, and these were then expanded to 100 years using the climate simulator CLIMGEN. Soil variability was simulated using the scale factor approach. The scale factor mean and standard deviation were obtained in eight locations within a 1000-m2 area. The stochastic scale factors were applied to parameters a and b in Campbell's water retention function and to hydraulic conductivity. The following combinations of crops were simulated in the two soils: (a) continuous maize for silage (MM); (b) continuous maize for grain (MG); (c) a combination of late harvested Italian ryegrass and short cycle silage maize (LRM); and (d) early harvested Italian ryegrass and late maturing silage maize (ERM). The crops were fertilized with 200 or 300 kg N ha-1 year-1 (or 450 kg for MM) and submitted to three water regimes: no irrigation, irrigation on the basis of water balance and conventional irrigation, which resulted in the highest volume. The simulated leaching was higher when fertilization and irrigation inputs were higher. It was further reduced by the introduction of cover-crop and was higher in the sandy soil. All these factors interacted, creating different levels of nitrate loss risk, that ranged from a minimum leaching of 4 kg N ha-1 year-1, with a 10% breakthrough probability of 16 kg N ha-1 year-1 (low fertilized and irrigated ERM in the sandy-loam soil) to a maximum average leaching of 146 kg N ha-1 year-1 with a 10% breakthrough probability of 235 kg N ha-1 year-1 (high fertilized, conventionally irrigated MM in the sandy soil). The breakthrough probability curves associated to nitrate leaching are skewed, showing that lower than average values are more frequent than higher ones. The standard deviations of yearly leaching were closely correlated to the means and were frequently greater than the means, particularly in the sandy soil. The stochastic simulation results offered the possibility of ranking cropping systems into classes of probability of exceeding a given value of leaching and the possibility of deriving suggestions for improved crop management.

Animal model, sire model and sire maternal grandsire model were tested for their suitability to evaluate young sires in progeny test. There were 38 188 records on animals slaughtered in two slaughter houses during a period of 20 months. Effects of year-month of slaughter, age at slaughter, sex and breed were statistically significant, and herd accounted for about 20-57% of the total variation in the data. Estimates of heritability in the different breed by sex data sets were in range of 0.07-0.14 for slaughter weight, 0.16-0.31 for fleshiness and 0.08-0.16 for fatness, whereas the corresponding within herd heritabilities varied from 0.15 to 0.29, 0.29 to 0.39 and 0.12 to 0.29, respectively. There was a positive genetic correlation of 0.38-0.66 between slaughter weight and fleshiness, whereas fatness was not genetically correlated with the other studied traits. All within herd correlations were high, from 0.55 to 0.93, and phenotypic and environmental correlations were also high or moderate. In the estimation of (co)variance components, sire model and sire maternal grandsire model were preferred to animal model due to computational requirements, and sire maternal grandsire model to sire model due to the possibility of including the sire path of maternal pedigree.

However, modeling for site-specific farming may require both greater accuracy and sensitivity to more parameters than current models allow. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the DSSAT V3.5 corn model, CERES-Maize, for sensitivity to parameters important to site-specific farming. The model was unexpectedly insensitive to inputs for soil type, depth to clay, nitrogen, and plant population, suggesting areas for attention. Although it was appropriately sensitive to rainfall, indicating sensitivity to soil water content is generally correct, there are known problems with the curve number procedure that calculates runoff. The runoff routine needs improvement, and a separate routine may be needed to accommodate within-field redistribution of runoff. The model also responded to maximum air temperature, but since crop temperature varies more than air temperature, perhaps crop temperature should be calculated from air temperature and water stress. Model accuracy issues aside, accommodating spatial inputs and model runs requires enhanced interfaces. These and other suggested enhancements to the model would improve its applicability for site-specific agriculture. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The negative result of the EBCTCG meta-analysis (Early breast cancer trialists', collaborative group. Effects of radiotherapy and surgery in early breast cancer. An overview of the randomised trials. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995;333:1444-1455) of clinical randomized trials on adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer is in strong contrast with the Danish 82B, 82C and British Columbia trials (Overgaard M, Hanse PS, Overgaar J, et al. Postoperative radiotherapy in high-risk premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82b Trial. N. Engl. J.

Med. 1997;337:956-962) showing an impressive survival benefit. This paper tries to fill in the gap between the conflicting results. Materials and methods: The 36 trials of the EBCTCG (Early breast cancer trialists', collaborative group, 1995) were prospectively screened for a number of objective parameters that are usually not analyzed in review papers. The odds of death data (and its variance) were borrowed from the original meta-analysis (Early breast cancer trialists', collaborative group, 1995) to check whether the objective features were significant predictors for overall survival benefit. Results: A significant survival benefit for the radiotherapy arm was found for recent trials (2P < 0.05), large trials (2P < 0.03), trials that used standard fractionation (2P < 0.02), and trials with a favourable crude survival (2P < 0.03). For these four parameters clear parameter-effect relations were found. In recent and large trials the odds reduction was 12.4% (2P = 0.004). Conclusions: Surgical adjuvant radiotherapy significantly improves overall survival of breast cancer patients provided that current techniques are used and treatment is given with standard fractionation. For the best subgroups we observed an odds of death reduction of more than 20%. The results of this study stress the importance of reducing cardiovascular and other late toxicity in adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",

We then assigned 8 km pixels to different habitat types using a vegetation map compiled from Landsat satellite imagery between 1978 and 1982. We found that woodland and forest pixels increased in greenness but that swamp pixels showed a marked decline in vegetative cover. National parks and game reserves, which have heavy restrictions on resource extraction and on-site patrols, both showed increases in vegetative cover, particularly for woodland pixels. Forest reserves, which are explicitly designed for forest protection but do not have on-site patrols, did no better than lands under no legal protection at all. Game controlled areas, which allow for settlement, cattle grazing, and hunting, suffered worse habitat degradation than areas with no legal protection, with bushlands, grasslands, swamps and 'other lands' pixels faring worse than baseline measures. These results show that complete protection and on-site policing are key elements in enhancing vegetation health in this region of tropical Africa, paralleling results for mammals in the same area.

(Link), in two countries where it grows as a native plant (France and England) and two countries where it grows as an alien plant (New Zealand and Australia). The data are used to test three hypotheses concerning the predicted differences in invertebrate community structure in native versus exotic habitats: (1) Are generalist phytophages dominant in exotic habitats and specialist phytophages dominant in native habitats? (2) Are there empty phytophage niches in exotic habitats? (3) As a plant species accumulates phytophages, do these in turn accumulate natural enemies? The broom fauna was sampled at five sites in each country by beating five broom bushes per site. The sampling efficiency of beating was quantified at one field site and it was shown to collect 87 % of invertebrate abundance, 95 % of invertebrate biomass and 100 % of phytophagous species found on the branches. Generalist phytophages were dominant on broom in exotic habitats and specialists dominant on broom in the native habitats. Thus, the two countries where broom grows as a native plant had higher numbers of total phytophage species and a higher abundance of specialist phytophages per bush. There was no significant difference in the average abundance of generalist phytophage species found per bush in native and alien habitats. Phytophages were assigned to seven feeding niches: suckers, root feeders, external chewers, flower feeders, seed feeders, miners and pollen feeders. Empty niches were found in the exotic habitats; species exploiting structurally specific parts of the host plant, such as flowers and seeds, were absent in the countries where broom grows as an alien plant. The pattern of niche occupancy was similar between native and exotic habitats when just the generalist phytophages were considered. As phytophage abundance and biomass increased, there were concomitant increases in natural enemy abundance and biomass. Thus, it appears that as plants accumulate phytophages, the phytophages in turn accumulate natural enemies and a food web develops around the plant. Moreover, in the native countries, the history of association between the natural enemies and their prey has been sufficient for specialist predators and parasitoids, feeding on the specialist phytophages, to have evolved.

A glyph's location, 3D size, color, and opacity encode up to 8 attributes of scalar data per glyph. We have extended the system's capabilities to explore shape variation as a visualization attribute. We use procedural shape generation techniques because they allow flexibility, data abstraction, and freedom from specification of detailed shapes. We have explored three procedural shape generation techniques: fractal detail generation, superquadrics, and implicit surfaces. These techniques allow from 1 to 14 additional data dimensions to be visualized using glyph shape.",

Drawing on social psychology and organizational behavior literatures, we develop a conceptual framework that proposes how these constructs are interrelated. The framework suggests two hypotheses. First, diversity variables high in job-relatedness and low in visibility will be positively related to customer-oriented POB. Second, diversity variables low in job-relatedness and high in visibility will be negatively related to such POB. In a field study, we conduct a preliminary test of these predictions. Specifically, we use company records and questionnaire data (from a firm in the nonalcoholic beverage industry) to compute associations between demographic diversity and prosocial behavior in 223 work units. Results provide preliminary support for our hypotheses. Consistent with the first prediction, functional background diversity has a significant positive association (\u03b2 = 0.26, p < 0.01) with the customer-oriented POB of work units, as does company tenure diversity (\u03b2 = 0.16, p < 0.05). Consistent with the second prediction, gender diversity has a significant negative association (\u03b2 = -0.13, p < 0.05) with customer-oriented POB; race diversity is also negatively related to POB (\u03b2 = -0.11), but at a marginal significance level. These findings lend credence to our conceptual framework and suggest that further study of its components is warranted. J BUSN RES 2000. 47.209-216. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.",

There was a high diversity of Archaea in the estuary, especially among the particle-attached Archaea, with representatives from four major phylogenetic clusters. Eighteen of 21 estuarine clones were closely related to clones from the river and the coastal ocean or to clusters of marine and soil clones identified in other studies. This contrasts with a similar study of the estuarine bacterial community that found 62% of bacterial 16S rRNA clones to be unique to the estuary. Archaea in the estuary were primarily allochthonous, and therefore, unlike the bacteria, probably do not form a native estuarine community.

The familiar paper journals and books of the geoscience literature are being supplemented, and some supplanted, by electronic versions offering new facilities. Geoscience repositories gain efficiency and flexibility in storage, management, access and presentation of data. Global standards help communications, sharing of facilities, integration of ideas, collaboration and delegation of decisions. An example from geological mapping illustrates how a broad view of computer methods leads, not just to better ways of delivering the same product, but to more fundamental improvements in expressing, sharing and generalizing the geologists' conceptual models. Familiarity with existing systems can blind us to their shortcomings: familiar methods may hide assumptions that are no longer relevant. The example suggests that maps, reports and supporting evidence can be linked by hypertext in a tightly connected model. Targeted distribution of appropriate, up-to-date information can replace the high-cost scattergun approach of conventional publication. This leads to a tentative identification of user needs.

Evidence is taken from recent research into the development of generic methodologies for the estimation of emissions of key urban pollutants from anthropogenic sources in the North West region of England. The inventory results, which are available in terms of a regional 5x5km grid, a sub-regional 1x1km grid and at the scale of the original activity data, are useful for a number of air quality management tasks. However, the requirements of producing a generic methodology which uses readily available data sources has been found to limit the degree of detail with which it is possible to develop estimation procedures and this has implications for the level of confidence associated with the results and their further application. One of the principal limitations is the availability of equivalent activity data for a number of administrative units. A further assessment of the results of the North West inventory has been made through a comparative study of the inventory data with other emissions data covering a sub-set of the study area. These investigations indicate that there are a number of variations between inventory results in terms of overall emission magnitudes and their spatial distribution. Observed differences between the estimates are attributable to different sources of activity data and emission factors and also as a result of the geographical data used to represent sources.

Alternative, environmentally acceptable disposal routes with potential financial benefits might lie in the development of biomass-to- energy schemes, which often provide fertiliser as a by-product.

This paper outlines the use of resource mapping to assist in the siting of centralised AD schemes; similar techniques may also be used to site other types of biomass to energy schemes, including direct combustion of farm manures. The paper uses a study in the UK to show how resource mapping and analysis can be used to identify sources of collectable farmyard manure in order to determine the potential for AD plants. With the forthcoming introduction of the European Commission (EC) Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, this could prove a valuable tool to highlight the priority areas where the potential for pollution could be a problem.",

These PECs were tested using simulations for two pilot study catchments (Calder and Went, UK).

In Italy also the average TBT residue level in seafood exceeded the TARL with a factor of 2.5, while in Japan the average TBT residue level in seafood almost equaled the TARL for this country.

        "Absrtact": "Background: Carvedilol reduces mortality and improves symptoms and ejection fraction in ischemic heart failure, but its mode of action is not well defined and not all patients respond to treatment The aim of the CHRISTMAS (Carvedilol Hibernation Reversible Ischaemia Trial, Marker of Success) study is to examine whether hibernation may be a significant factor determining this response. This paper describes the methodology and the rationale for the choice of the nuclear cardiology and echocardiography imaging techniques used in the study. Methods and results: The CHRISTMAS study is a double-blind, randomised, parallel group, multinational study of oral carvedilol versus placebo in patients with chronic stable heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction from coronary artery disease. The study aims to randomise 400 patients who are on optimal treatment. Two parallel groups will be randomised to carvedilol or placebo, namely 200 with hibernating myocardium at baseline and 200 matched patients without. The presence of hibernation is defined from a mismatch between regional contractile function and regional viability, measured by echocardiography (severe segmental asynergy) and nitrate prepared resting Tc99m-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging (segmental activity >60%). The primary treatment-related end-point of the study is the comparison of the mean change, from baseline to the final visit, in radionuclide-determined left ventricular ejection fraction in patients on placebo with those on carvedilol, between the groups designated as hibernating and non-hibernating. Other end-points being examined include the prevalence of hibernation in heart failure, the relationship between the volume of hibernating myocardium and the ejection fraction response, the prevalence of reversible ischemia in heart failure, and the comparison of echo with gated SPECT. To date, 303 patients have been screened and 251 patients randomised in the study. The study aims to report in 2000. Conclusions: The CHRISTMAS study addresses the issue of whether the presence of hibernation is a predictor of the ejection fraction response to carvedilol in heart failure. It also examines the potential role of medical therapy in hibernation as well as a number of other end-points. The study may potentially lead to an important new role for nuclear cardiology in heart failure, and demonstrates important synergy between cardiac imaging and the pharmaceutical industry.

BeppoSAX offers broad-band spectroscopy in the 0.1-100 keV band with in addition imaging spectroscopy (arcminute resolution) in the 0.1-10 keV band. The high sensitivity and well-behaved point-spread function at high energies allows a study of the spatial distribution of both the iron K\u03b1 (6.7keV) and K\u03b2 (8keV) complex. In the Perseus cluster the observed K\u03b2/K\u03b1 ratio is significantly higher than that predicted by standard thermal emission codes. This ratio decreases significantly outwards, providing evidence for resonance scattering of the iron K\u03b1 line. Taking this into account the iron abundance in the core of the Perseus cluster is nearly twice as large as previously thought. In A 2199 there is evidence for a hard non-thermal tail in the spectrum. Spatially resolved spectroscopy with the MECS instrument shows spectral hardening in the outer parts of the cluster. Moreover the simultaneously taken PDS spectrum of this cluster shows a tail extending up to at least 50 keV. Apart from the high-energy spectral component, the LECS data also show evidence for excess emission at large radii. The soft excess was also detected by the DS instrument of EUVE. This together is very suggestive for the presence of inverse Compton emission in A 2199. Recent EUVE and BeppoSAX observations of the Coma cluster also support the presence of strong non-thermal emission, in addition to the thermal component. We shorthly discuss a few consequences of these new results for the dynamics of clusters. \u00a9 2000 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "The distribution of surficial sediments and sediment dispersion patterns on the steep continental slope off Nice (SE France) have been studied using side-scan sonar, 3.5 kHz profiles, short piston cores and bottom photographs. The input of terrigenous material to the Baie des Anges, a submarine embayment bounded by two prominent ridges, is dominated by fluvial input from the Var River, the Paillon River being only a minor source. The Var River provides very coarse bedload material (gravel and cobble) directly to the head of the Var Canyon. Gravel and cobble deposits are found along the Var Canyon and the Upper Fan Valley of the Var submarine fan and have been shaped into gravel waves. The fine particles (suspension load) are separated from the coarse bedload upon entering the sea and form up to 60-m thick deposits on the uppermost continental slope of the Baie des Anges. These deposits are formed by settling out of sediment plumes. The presence of silt and fine sand laminae that decrease in thickness and frequency away from the Var River mouth indicate the influence of meso- and hyperpycnal flows on these plume deposits. Areas outside the Baie des Anges are not connected to major fluvial input and receive only hemipelagic sediments. These primary deposits are highly unstable and sediment failure due to seismic loading, sedimentary loading or undercutting is frequent. Sediment failure produces secondary sediment gravity flows that export most of the material to the basin, but also produce turbidity-current over-spill deposits on ridges bounding the slope canyons and on terraces within the Var Canyon. Slump and debris-flow deposits are also observed. At least some of these secondary flows erode the continental slope as cross-cutting chutes on the upper continental slope and erosional scours in the Upper Fan Valley demonstrate. Modem sediment dispersal patterns on the continental slope off Nice are proposed as a modem analogue to lowstand conditions on continental margins. In fact, the absence of a continental shelf together with a steep slope strongly reduces the influence of sealevel on the physiography of the margin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause that affects around 1% of the adult population in the U.S. Women are more often affected than men by a ratio of 3 to 1, and although the disease can appear at any age in adult life, the incidence and prevalence increase with age. The inflammatory process that characterizes RA, centers in and around articular structures and is characterized by destruction that progresses over time. Attempts to apply curve fitting to the analysis of the progression of radiographic damage in RA have lead to numerous forms of mathematical models (linear, quadratic, cubic, square root, first-order kinetics, etc.). None of these models has been very successful in that a significant degree of ambiguity of the appropriate model form still remains. A mathematical model of the progression of RA would be useful to evaluate the effect of interventions to ameliorate joint destruction. In this paper, we present a rigorously derived second-order kinetics model and propose (a) a possible explanation for the ambiguity found in prior analyses, and (b) present a potentially clinically useful model for RA disease progression based upon radiographic assessment of joint damage.

        "Absrtact": "Lowermost Silurian organic-rich ('hot') shales are the origin of 80-90% of Palaeozoic sourced hydrocarbons in North Africa and also played a major role in petroleum generation on the Arabian Peninsula. In most cases, the shales were deposited directly above upper Ordovician (peri-) glacial sandstones during the initial early Silurian transgression that was a result of the melting of the late Ordovician icecap. Deposition of the main organic-rich shale unit in the North African/Arabian region was restricted to the earliest Silurian Rhuddanian stage (acuminatus, atavus and probably early cyphus graptolite biozones). During this short period (1-2 m.y.), a favourable combination of factors existed which led to the development of exceptionally strong oxygen-deficiency in the area. In most countries of the study area, the post-Rhuddanian Silurian shales are organically lean and have not contributed to petroleum generation. The distribution and thickness of the basal Silurian 'hot' shales have been mapped in detail for the whole North African region, using logs from some 300 exploration wells in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. In addition, all relevant, accessible published and unpublished surface and subsurface data of the lower Silurian shales in North Africa and Arabia have been reviewed, including sedimentological, biostratigraphic and organic geochemical data. The lowermost Silurian hot shales of northern Gondwana are laterally discontinuous and their distribution and thickness were controlled by the early Silurian palaeorelief which was shaped mainly by glacial processes of the late Ordovician ice age and by Pan-African and Infracambrian compressional and extensional tectonism. The thickest and areally most extensive basal Silurian organic-rich shales in North Africa occur in Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya, while on the Arabian Peninsula they are most prolific in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Iraq. The hot shales were not deposited in Egypt, which was a large palaeohigh at that time. The depositional model presented may help in better understanding the source potential of the basal Silurian shales in less-explored regions of North Africa and Arabia including Morocco, northern Niger and the Kufra Basin in southeast Libya.

        "Absrtact": "The Paleozoic-Mesozoic Jameson Land Basin (East Greenland) is intruded by a sill complex and by a swarm of ESE trending dykes. Together with dykes of the inner Scoresby Sund fjord, they form a regional Early Tertiary intrusive complex located ~ 200-400 km inland of the East Greenland rifted continental margin. Most of the intrusive rocks in the Jameson Land Basin are geochemically coherent and consist of evolved plagioclase-augite-olivine saturated, uncontaminated high-Ti basalt with 48.5-50.2 wt.% SiO2, 2.2-3.2 wt.% TiO2, 5.1-7.4 wt.% MgO, 9-17 ppm Nb and La/Yb(N) = 2.8-3.6. Minor tholeiitic rock types are: (a) low-Ti basalt (~ 49.7 wt.% SiO2, ~ 1.7 wt.% TiO2, ~ 6.8 wt.% MgO, ~ 2.6 ppm Nb and La/Yb(N) = ~ 0.5) akin to oceanic basalts; (b) very-high-Ti basalt (~48.6 wt.% SiO2, ~ 4.1 wt.% TiO2, ~ 5.1 wt.% MgO and ~ 21 ppm Nb); and (c) plagioclase ultraphyric basalt. The tholeiitic dolerites are cut by alkali basalt (43.7-47.3 wt.% SiO2, 4.1-5.1 wt.% TiO2, 4.9-6.2 wt.% MgO, 29-46 ppm Nb and La/Yb(N) = 16-17) sills and dykes. Modelling of high-field-strength and rare-earth elements indicate that the high-Ti basalts formed from ~ 6-10% melting of approximately equal proportions of garnet- and spinel-bearing mantle of slightly depleted composition beneath thick continental lithosphere. Conversely, dolerite intrusions and flood basalts of similar compositional kindred from adjacent but more rift-proximal occurrences in Northeast Greenland formed from shallower melting of dominantly spinel-bearing mantle beneath extended and thinned continental lithosphere. These variations in lithospheric thickness suggest the continent-ocean transition of the East Greenland rifted volcanic margin is sharp and narrow. 40Ar-39Ar dating and paleomagnetism show that the high-Ti dolerites were emplaced at ~ 53-52 Ma (most likely during C23r) and hence surprisingly postdate the main flood volcanism by ~ 2-5 Ma and the inception of seafloor spreading between Greenland and Europe by ~ 1-2 Ma. The formation of tholeiitic and alkaline magmas emplaced into the Jameson Land Basin corroborates to the importance of post-breakup magmatism along the East Greenland volcanic rifted margin. Upwelling of the ancestral Iceland mantle plume under central Greenland at 53-52 Ma (rather than under the active rift), perhaps accompanied by a failed attempt to shift the rift zone westward towards the plume axis, may have triggered post-breakup continental magmatism of the Jameson Land Basin and the inner Scoresby Sund region, along preexisting structural lineaments.

        "Absrtact": "Background and Objectives: Since conventional randomized clinical trials often do not reflect the real world circumstances of prescribing behavior and patient outcomes, the use of retrospective administrative claims databases (RACD) has become more common in treatment cost comparisons among alternative pharmaceutical compounds. Several recent RACD studies have compared treatment costs for depressed patients prescribed SSRIs such as fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine. These cost comparisons have reached mixed conclusions. To begin to explain and reconcile the mixed SSRI cost comparison evidence, we undertake a variety of alternative multivariate analyses using a publicly available RACD. Methods and Data: The 1995 to 1996 data encompasses a time period when all three SSRIs had become well-established agents. We report and compare results from multivariate linear regressions, logistic regressions, ordered probits and sample selectivity models, and examine robustness when adjustments are made for outlier observations and skewed distributions. Results and Conclusions: While choice of initial SSRI is nonrandom, the effect of sample selectivity on total depression-related and total health care expenditure is neutral across SSRIs. Although most cost measures are numerically greatest for fluoxetine, depression-related outpatient and hospitalization costs do not significantly differ by choice of initial SSRI. These findings are robust to alternative assumptions, specifications, and procedures. Antidepressant medication costs, however, are significantly higher when fluoxetine is the initial SSRI rather than sertraline or paroxetine, reflecting the larger proportion of fluoxetine patients prescribed a daily dosage of two or more capsules. Both total depression-related and total health care log-transformed costs are significantly lower for sertraline than fluoxetine.",

        "Absrtact": "A soil vegetation atmosphere transfer scheme (SVAT), describing the fluxes of heat, water vapour and CO 2 between a multi-component vegetated land surface and the atmosphere, has been developed. The SVAT has been calibrated and tested using 30 days of micrometeorological and physiological measurements collected over a sparse savannah in the Sahel. The model explicitly represents the four major functional components of the savannah: shrubs (C 3 photosynthesis), grasses (C 4 ), herbs (C 3 ) and bare soil. The leaf conductance model for the shrub, grass and herb components was calibrated against porometry measurements made in the field. The performance of the SVAT was tested against independent surface flux and temperature measurements. Agreement between the model predictions and measurements of the total net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, net CO 2 exchange and surface temperatures was good: in all cases at least 80% of the variance in the measurements was explained by the model. Separate flux and surface temperature predictions for the four surface components were satisfactory, although complete verification was difficult as data were lacking for some variables. Predicted water use efficiency (WUE) of the vegetation showed a strong, non-linear dependence on vapour pressure deficit, especially for the bushes and the grasses. WUE for the grasses was about three times as large as the values found for the bushes and herbs. A SVAT model like this can be employed to address the possible effects of CO 2 enrichment and climate change on the competitive balance between different species in a plant community or in research concerning productivity and water use efficiency in mixed crops, such as agroforestry systems.

The generalized maximum trace formulation captures several forms of multiple sequence alignment problems in a common framework, among them the original formulation of maximum trace. The RNA sequence alignment problem captures the comparison of RNA molecules on the basis of their primary sequence and their secondary structure. Both problems have a characterization in terms of graphs which we reformulate in terms of integer linear programming. We then study the polytopes (or convex hulls of all feasible solutions) associated with the integer linear program for both problems. For each polytope we derive several classes of facet-defining inequalities and show that for some of these classes the corresponding separation problem can be solved in polynomial time. This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment that is not based on dynamic programming. Moreover, for multiple sequences the branch-and-cut algorithms for both sequence alignment problems are able to solve to optimality instances that are beyond the range of present dynamic programming approaches. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

I consider a quantitative technique frequently used by Pierre Bourdieu and the mathematics developed by James Coleman for the foundations of his social theory, with respect to each other, from the respective analysts' points of view, and from my concern with developing more sturdy relations among the methodological tools in a practice theorist's kit. Specifically, I treat both frameworks as implementing in innovative ways the concept of 'duality', the co-constitution of elements at one level and relations at another (higher or lower) level of social action. I show that there is a remarkable homology, at the level of their formal practices, between the mathematical techniques of Bourdieu and those of Coleman. New ways to implement Galois lattice analysis are among the gains of this inquiry. Applications are to relations among the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.

        "Absrtact": "A method for precise Pb analysis using a 207Pb-204Pb spike has been developed at Royal Holloway. Pb isotope ratios are calculated relative to 206Pb and are normalised in a run to an arbitrary 208Pb/206Pb ratio to permit good estimates of error propagation through the fractionation correction. While 204Pb/206Pb normalised to 208Pb/206Pb appears free from interferences and obeys power- or exponential-law mass fractionation within analytical error. 207Pb/206Pb shows systematic decreases with increase in 208Pb/206Pb at > 1250\u00b0C that are extremely difficult to explain by isobaric interference and may indicate abnormal mass fractionation behaviour. However, this behaviour is absent from plasma-source mass spectrometers. Correction for the effect improves external reproducibility of SRM981 from 96 to 82 ppm (1 sd. 33 analyses over 1 year) for 206Pb/204Pb, and from 64 to 43 ppm for 207Pb/206Pb. For 206Pb/204Pb, this external reproducibility is only about twice the typical internal error on a single analysis after error propagation through the fractionation correction. Relative to the fractionation-corrected isotope ratios, measured ratios for unknown samples analysed are significantly more enriched in the lighter isotopes than are runs of SRM981, indicating that corrections based on average SRM981 mass fractionation are likely to be in error. Acid-leached rock chips and acid-leached powders generally give identical Pb ratios within analytical error. However, re-analysis of samples previously published by several laboratories shows large differences, up to 30 X the supposed reproducibility of conventional Pb isotope determinations, probably related both to inadequate fractionation corrections and to environmental contamination of rock powder.",

        "Absrtact": "The Lamongan volcanic field (LVF) in East Java, Indonesia, consists of up to 61 basaltic cinder or spatter cones, a minimum of 29 prehistoric maars, and a central compound complex comprising three main vents including the historically active Lamongan volcano. The field lies on the Sunda volcanic arc and abuts onto the currently active Tengger caldera-Semeru complex to the west. Between 1799 and 1898, Lamongan was persistently active and discharged up to 15 lava flows of basaltic to basaltic andesite composition, which is probably more than what was erupted by any other Indonesian volcano in that period. Several seismic crises have been recorded in the LVF since Lamongan's last eruption. There are no existing records of cinder cone or maar-forming eruptions in the area. Despite the possible hazards posed by future activity in the LVF, the history and structure of the field have been subject to little scrutiny. This contribution presents the results of a detailed morphometric and volumetric investigation of prehistoric vents and historic lava flows in the LVF, using field data, historic records, satellite imagery and modelling of erupted volumes. A typical LVF maar is characterised as a crater with a diameter of 450 m; generated by an eruption with a model ejecta volume of 0.016 km3 dense rock equivalent (DRE) and a model juvenile component volume of 0.0096 km3 DRE. Diameter/depth ratios of some maars display a morphological freshness comparable to recently formed phreatomagmatic eruption craters elsewhere. The median LVF cinder/spatter cone has a basal diameter of 600 m, a height of 75 m, a volume of 0.009 km3 and a model total erupted volume of 0.014 km3. Variation in cone basal diameter to height ratios indicates that the age of some prehistoric cones may not exceed a few centuries, and morphological classification identifies the youngest prehistoric vents on the northern flanks of the central edifice. Historic activity from vents on the western flanks of Lamongan produced at least ~0.05 km3 of basaltic to basaltic andesite lava. Resurfacing rates at Lamongan in the 19th Century imply an age of ~ 900-2100 years for the surface of the volcano. The steady-state eruptive rate from 1843-1898 is evaluated as 0.025 m3 s-1, which is low in comparison to estimates from many presently active systems. Using eruptive rate and volume data, the age of the LVF is estimated as between 13 and 40 ka, placing it among the youngest dated Indonesian volcanoes. Complex regional tectonics in conjunction with magmatic pressure have probably been the major influences on the distribution of volcanism in the LVF. The occurrence of maar-forming eruptions may have been controlled by a porous substrate, possibly a deposit from the Holocene Iyang-Argapura complex to the east. Volcanic hazards from future eruptions in the LVF include base surges, ash flows, ashfall and ejected blocks associated with phreatomagmatic activity, and ashfall and ejecta from magmatic eruptions.

In these situations, the litter layer or the forest floor (FF) may play an important role in the forest water balance, controlling water fluxes and nutrient cycling. We investigated the forest floor water dynamics in four representative forest ecosystems in the Middle Caqueta, Colombian Amazonia (tertiary sedimentary plain, high terrace, low terrace and the rarely inundated flood plain). Meteorological conditions were measured on hourly basis, FF water storage capacity, TDR water content in the FF and litterflow or FF drainage were measured daily over a two year period. A dynamic model was developed to simulate FF water storage, root water uptake and drainage to the mineral soil. The four-parameter model was calibrated applying a step-wise procedure. Analysis of collected data showed that FF water content was generally lower in the sedimentary plain than in the other ecosystems, whereas FF water storage was the highest due to a high FF mass. The average storage capacity per unit FF thickness was 1.23 mm cm-1. The sensitivity analysis and calibration of model parameters highlighted the relevance of storage capacity as the most sensitive parameter for the FF water dynamics. For the validation period, there is a good agreement between predicted and measured FF water storage and especially between predicted total drainage from the forest floor and measured litterflow. Model predictions indicate that water uptake from the FF's during the validation period (190 days) differed between ecosystems, ranging from 15 to about 28% of the reference transpiration. This seems to be related to the fraction of fine roots in the FF in each ecosystem and to the water availability. On the other hand, total drainage to the mineral soil was very similar among ecosystems, except for the sedimentary plain, where total drainage was the lowest with about 87% of incoming throughfall.

In these situations, the litter layer or the forest floor (FF) may play an important role in the forest water balance, controlling water fluxes and nutrient cycling. We investigated the forest floor water dynamics in four representative forest ecosystems in the Middle Caqueta, Colombian Amazonia (tertiary sedimentary plain, high terrace, low terrace and the rarely inundated flood plain). Meteorological conditions were measured on hourly basis, FF water storage capacity, TDR water content in the FF and litterflow or FF drainage were measured daily over a two year period. A dynamic model was developed to simulate FF water storage, root water uptake and drainage to the mineral soil. The four-parameter model was calibrated applying a step-wise procedure. Analysis of collected data showed that FF water content was generally lower in the sedimentary plain than in the other ecosystems, whereas FF water storage was the highest due to a high FF mass. The average storage capacity per unit FF thickness was 1.23 mm cm-1. The sensitivity analysis and calibration of model parameters highlighted the relevance of storage capacity as the most sensitive parameter for the FF water dynamics. For the validation period, there is a good agreement between predicted and measured FF water storage and especially between predicted total drainage from the forest floor and measured litterflow. Model predictions indicate that water uptake from the FF's during the validation period (190 days) differed between ecosystems, ranging from 15 to about 28% of the reference transpiration. This seems to be related to the fraction of fine roots in the FF in each ecosystem and to the water availability. On the other hand, total drainage to the mineral soil was very similar among ecosystems, except for the sedimentary plain, where total drainage was the lowest with about 87% of incoming throughfall.",

        "Absrtact": "An in situ laser particle sizer, the LISST-100, was used to describe the spatial variation of beam attenuation coefficient, in situ particle size spectra and aggregate densities in a dredging plume in the sound Oresund between Denmark and Sweden. The results proved that the above mentioned parameters varied significantly within the investigated length of the plume (approximately 2 km). It is shown how the small single primary particles aggregate and change the in situ particle size spectra into a slightly better sorted and coarser size distribution, and at the same time how the mean density of particles/aggregates decreases significantly. This shift in the state in which the particles exist in the water effectively changes the optical response of the mass of particles suspended in the water. It is shown that adequate correlations between mass concentrations and beam attenuation coefficients can only be obtained if parameters describing the in situ quality and state of the mass of particles, e.g. standard deviation of the size spectra and volume concentration, is included in the regression. From the spatial variation in mean density and in situ particle size, it was possible to calculate the spatial difference in settling velocity. It was found that the difference in settling velocity was only about a factor of 1.7, because increasing in situ particle size was counter-balanced by decreasing mean density. Furthermore, the time-scale of flocculation within the plume was found to be in the order of 50 min. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

This repressor function of Isw2 complex is largely dependent upon Ume6p, which recruits the complex to target genes. Nuclease digestion analyses revealed that Isw2 complex establishes nuclease-inaccessible chromatin structure near the Ume6p binding site in vivo.

        "Absrtact": "In burial environments, carbonate sediments undergo mineralogical stabilization and increasing lithification with depth. As yet, however, little knowledge exists with respect to the corresponding effects on fossil preservation and taphonomic modification of the original sediment composition. Countings of particles (>63 \u03bcm) in Miocene to Recent periplatform sediments (ODP Leg 133, NE Australia) exhibit a clear trend of reduction of skeletal aragonite downcore. Low- and high-Mg-calcite grains occur in a continuous order of magnitude over the studied interval (<600 m sub-bottom depth). Original microtextures are retained in high-Mg-calcite biota, although converted to low-Mg-calcite. Thus, the conversion to low-Mg-calcite appears to occur without introducing a significant quantitative bias. Aragonite skeletons (pelagic gastropods), however, exhibit a successive exposure of deeper crystal layers and a chalky preservation with burial depth, which we interpret to result from dissolution. Hints for the originally more numerous existence of aragonite biota exist in soft sediments and chalks by the presence of internal moulds, shells replaced by microspar, and mouldic porosity in early cemented hardgrounds. In deep sections barren of aragonite, the number of casts and replaced shells remains unchanged and is insignificant as compared to aragonitic biota probably originally present within the sediment (<2% in ooze/chalk vs. 30-50% of grains in modern periplatform sediments). Therefore, palaeontological information must be significantly biased through selective removal of aragonite. Rates of preservation and destruction depend on external factors during sediment accretion (sedimentation rates, clay content, total organic carbon content) and rates of fluid flow within the sediment. These observations are relevant with respect to the diagenetic potential and patterns of fossil preservation in little cemented calcitic cool-water carbonates, because they may originally have contained more aragonite biota as important constituents of an ecosystem than is commonly suspected, and calcite/aragonite ratios in ancient carbonate sediments may not necessarily reflect original input signals (climate or sea level).

Full depth Total CO2 (TCO2) sections are presented for austral autumn and winter (1992) cruises. Pronounced fCO2 gradients were observed at the Southern Ocean fronts. In the Weddell Gyre, fCO2 regimes appeared to coincide with surface and subsurface hydrographic regimes. The southern ACC was supersaturated with respect to CO2, as was part of the northern Weddell Gyre. The southern Weddell Gyre was markedly undersaturated. The great potential of autumn cooling for generating undersaturation and CO2 uptake from the atmosphere was demonstrated. In the northeastern Weddell Gyre, upwelling of CO2- and salt-rich deep water was shown to play a role as the horizontal fCO2 distribution closely resembled that of the surface salinity. The total uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the Weddell Gyre in autumn (45 days) was calculated to be 7 \u00b7 1012 g C. The deep TCO2 distribution noticeably reflected the different water masses in the region. A new deep TCO2 maximum was detected in the ACC, which apparently characterizes the boundary between the equatorward flowing Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). East of the Weddell Gyre, the AABW stratum is much thicker (>2000 m) than more to the west, on the prime meridian (<300 m). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The main objective was to interpret recent, natural and human-induced influences upon the accumulation-erosion balance and the sedimentary environment from Holocene sediment units. The five main units are: consolidated glaciomarine clay (Facies gC) lowermost, consolidated estuarine clay (Facies dC), soft sub-recent sediment (Facies omC and Facies C) uppermost and dumped sediment (Facies D) in some parts of the study area. The sediment facies are divided by two major hiatuses: (a) the early Holocene hiatus between Facies gC and dC involves a time gap of at least 7000 years, ending at ca. 4000 BP and (b) the late Holocene hiatus between the consolidated clays (Facies gC and dC) and Facies omC spans 1000 years and ends ca. 50 BP (i.e. 100 years ago). Both hiatuses probably relate to the effects of isostatic land uplift. Surface sediments consist mainly of an organic-matter-rich clay facies, suggesting changes in the trophic state of the estuary during the last 100 years. Together with human-induced increased river erosion and loss of accommodation space in the estuary, this caused the onset of sedimentation in the estuary. The recent sediments are contaminated with heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Hg), with highest concentrations in the lower part of Facies omC. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We briefly describe the climatological features of its formation and circulation, and then examine temporal changes in its properties associated with the climate regime shift in the 1970s. We use a variety of data, which include the repeat hydrographic sections along 130\u00b0E, 137\u00b0E, 144\u00b0E and 155\u00b0E meridians, the hydrographic data from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series, the World Ocean Atlas 1994, and available gridded data of wind stress and evaporation. The classical idea that NPTW originates from the zone of the highest sea surface salinity at 20\u00b0-30\u00b0N centered around the international date line and spreads along the isopycnal geostrophic flow patterns is confirmed. Further, it is shown that the meridional extent of NPTW along 137\u00b0E is from 10\u00b0N to 23\u00b0N on average and the highest salinity core lies at about 15\u00b0N and 24.0\u03c3(\u03b8), and that the portion of NPTW north (south) of about 15\u00b0N originates from the formation region west (east) of the date line. NPTW in the 137\u00b0E section changed remarkably associated with the mid-1970s regime shift. North of 15\u00b0N NPTW increased both in its salinity and thickness while to the south of 15\u00b0N only its salinity increased and its thickness remained unchanged. The westward geostrophic velocity is increased significantly in both the southern and northern parts of NPTW. The northern thickening and speedup and the southern speedup increased NPTW transport across 137\u00b0E. The changes in the thermohaline forcing such as evaporation and Ekman salt convergence in the NPTW formation region possibly contributed to the increases in salinity in the southern part of NPTW, but not to that of the northern part, On the other hand, the increased Ekman pumping accounts for the increase of the NPTW inventory and transport at 137\u00b0E. The increased salinity of NPTW at 137\u00b0E, especially its northern portion, was presumably caused by an increase in its formation rate rather than changes in the sea surface salinity in its formation region; the thicker the NPTW layer is, the saltier is the core that tends to survive the mixing processes.

In the second part, they concentrate on the variation of the modulus of elasticity of green wood (MOE(fresh)) and the density within the stem to analyse the effect of the underlying patterns in variation of these wood properties on the mechanics of the entire stem. At the standing-tree level, the investigations comprised a morphological description and static bending tests on the trees to measure flexural stiffness and structural Young's modulus of the stem. Discs sampled from different stem heights were examined to distinguish between different tissues (cortex, wood, pith) and wood types (adult, adolescent, juvenile), and to measure quantitatively their contribution to the axial second moment of area of the stem. An analysis of the variation of density and MOE(fresh) within the stem was carried out on small wood samples cut out of stem sections taken from the same height as the stem discs. The flexural stiffness of the trees is mainly influenced by stem radius, resulting in a higher flexural stiffness for thicker trees. Independently from the stem dimensions, the structural Young's modulus was slightly higher for the suppressed trees within each site. In an individual tree the structural Young's modulus decreases with increasing stem height. The cross-sectional analyses of wood type proportions and their characterisation by density and MOE(fresh) showed that the distribution of adult, adolescent and juvenile wood within the stem affects the structural Young's modulus and the flexural stiffness of the stem. Finally, a method is presented that allows a re-calculation of the mechanical bending properties of the entire standing trees using MOE and axial second moments of area of the different wood types. Our results suggest that further modelling of mechanical behaviour of trees might be possible taking into account the composite nature of conifer stems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Previous reports demonstrated that data from air- and spaceborne sensors are appropriate for delineation of soil patterns. Also, many attempts have been made to use digital elevation model (DEM) for deriving soil information. However, little is known about the potential use of low spatial resolution satellite and digital elevation data in small-scale soil mapping. A case study was conducted to assess the use of integrated terrain and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) databases for small-scale soil pattern delineation. The main objective was to test the effect of the addition of terrain descriptor data to the AVHRR data set on the classification results. Two database were used for the study. The first one was purely AVHRR data and contained the five basic AVHRR channels and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of five different dates, while in the second database the AVHRR data was complemented with a DEM, a curvature, a slope, an aspect and the potential drainage density layers. The performance of these two databases when employed to derive soil information was compared. These databases were then further processed using the Discriminant Analysis Feature Extraction (DAFE) function (which is based on a canonical analysis procedure), and were then classified using the Fisher linear discriminant, and the ECHO spectral-spatial classifiers. Based on the results, it was concluded that the two reflective bands, the middle infrared, the two thermal bands and the NDVI provided a relatively wide range of detectable soil information. The use of single images or small dimensional AVHRR data sets (less then 10 layers) does not result in acceptable performances, while the use of multispectral and multitemporal databases improved the classification performance very significantly. However, the purely AVHRR-based model could not always delineate soil variations related to terrain differences, and resulted in an overall classification performance of 49.1%. Digital elevation and terrain descriptor data were essential in the model for achieving acceptable results. In the second part of the study an integrated AVHRR-terrain database was used, where five terrain layers were added to the 30 AVHRR channels. Two different spatial resolutions were compared, 500 m and 1 km, respectively. The use of elevation, slope, aspect and curvature as differentiating criteria often lead to a satisfactory result in terrain characterization, particularly in large-scale mapping. However, with those variables extracted from DEM of physiographically complex areas, e.g., - where plain areas and mountainous/hilly regions occur together in the same study - often lose their ability to delineate soil variations of the level lands. Beyond these terrain descriptors we implemented a new function, called potential drainage density (PDD) to improve the performance of the model on the plain areas. The classification accuracy of the integrated AVHRR-terrain database was improved significantly over the case when only AVHRR data was in the model. The classification performances of the three different resolution images were 87.3% for the 500-m resolution image and 70.1% for the 1-km resolution image. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Salmonella spp. and foods of animal origin (red meat, poultry and seafood) were most frequently associated with outbreaks during this period. Improper cooking, inadequate storage, cross-contamination and use of raw ingredients in the preparation of food were the most common factors contributing to outbreaks. Classification and cross tabulation of surveillance information relating to aetiological agents, food vehicles and contributory factors facilitates hazard analysis. In forming control measures and their corresponding critical limits, this approach focuses monitoring on those aspects that are critical to the safety of the product. Incorporation of epidemiological data in the documentation of HACCP systems provides assurance that the system is based on the best scientific information available.

        "Absrtact": "We report major and trace element analyses for 82 coarse-grained peridotite xenoliths from 25 Cenozoic volcanic centres throughout the Massif Central (France). These data cover a region of about 150 x 150 km, allowing an investigation of large scale compositional variations in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). In agreement with textural variations, geochemical data define two contrasting lithospheric domains, situated north and south of latitude 45\u00b030'. Peridotites of the northern domain show protogranular textures, characterised by clustered pyroxene-spinel distributions. They are rather refractory and depleted in MREE relative to HREE, but pervasively enriched in LREE and other highly incompatible elements. The samples show mantle-normalised patterns with negative anomalies of Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf, similar to enriched mantle xenoliths ascribed to carbonatitic metasomatism. In contrast, the peridotites of the southern domain are devoid of pyroxene-spinel clusters and are therefore referred to as coarse-granular. They are distinguished from the northern suite by more fertile compositions and relatively flat MREE-HREE patterns. In addition, only the harzburgites and a few lherzolites are enriched in LREE. Most southern domain lherzolites are depleted in these elements and the average composition of the southern suite is comparable to that of depleted MORB-source mantle (DMM). The main compositional differences between the two domains cannot be accounted for by a secular evolution of the Massif Central SCLM caused by Cenozoic plume upwelling. Instead, these differences record the existence of distinct lithospheric blocks assembled during the Variscan orogeny. To some degree, the northern and southern domains are reminiscent of cratonic and circumcratonic SCLM domains. Being relatively refractory and pervasively enriched in LREE, the northern domain displays similarities with cratonic SCLM. It is interpreted as a relatively ancient (pre-Variscan) lithospheric block involved in the Variscan belt. Conversely, the fertile composition and the DMM signature of the southern domain evoke more juvenile lithospheric mantle, possibly accreted or rejuvenated during the Variscan orogeny. Geophysical data indicate that asthenospheric upwelling beneath Massif Central is focused beneath the southern domain and follows a NW-SE trend, roughly parallel to Variscan structures in the crust. Though poorly constrained in direction, the limit between the two SCLM domains recognised in this study is consistent with this trend. This may suggest a link between the inherited architecture of the SCLM and channelling of asthenospheric upwelling. Secular variations in xenolith geochemistry, as well as correlations between trace element data and geophysical anomalies, suggest that the geochemical imprint of Cenozoic plume upwelling on SCLM xenoliths is limited to selective enrichments in U, Sr and Pb relative to Th and REE.

        "Absrtact": "We use micropalaeontological and stable isotope results for a series of cores from north to south through the Red Sea, to assess temporal and spatial patterns of change in planktonic foraminiferal faunas leading up to the remarkable full-glacial Red Sea aplanktonic zones. Aplanktonic zones reflect salinities in the Red Sea in excess of the lethal 49 p.s.u. limit, caused by reduced exchange transport through the Strait of Bab el Mandab due to glacial sea-level lowering. Concerning the last glacial cycle, aplanktonic conditions began at 39 ka BP in the north, where salinities eventually reached 55-57 p.s.u. Paradoxically, planktonic faunas are reported to have survived the last glacial maximum in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, suggesting a poorly understood freshwater dilution at that time. Aplanktonic conditions (S \u2265 49 p.s.u.) reached the south-central Red Sea by 22 ka BP, while planktonic foraminiferal faunas continued, albeit in very low abundances and limited diversity (S \u2264 45 p.s.u.), in the southernmost Red Sea. During marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, the 49 p.s.u. isohaline appears to have resided in the central Red Sea, between cores KL11 and MD921017. We observe a systematic sequence of species disappearances before all glacial maxima of the last 500 kyr. Absence of a logical relationship with sea levels suggests that the disappearance sequences are not related to a general salinity increase. Instead, we argue that the sequences were driven by complex reorganisations in hydrography (stratification), productivity (food availability) and subsurface oxygenation (reproduction-habitats). The onset is marked by dramatic basin-wide expansion of conditions that today are restricted to only the southern Red Sea, suggesting an expansion of the dominance of NE monsoonal circulation over the entire Red Sea. This expansion occurred 15 or more kyr before the aplanktonic zones of MIS-12, 6 and 2, and also before MIS-10 and 8, which never reach the aplanktonic stage. Regarding the last glacial cycle, this event occurred as early as 75 ka BP (MIS-4/5 boundary). After this major climatic reorganisation, we reconstruct progressive intensification of the new conditions, especially marked by northward expansion and intensification of the subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). During the last glacial cycle, a shallow and very distinct OMZ affected the central Red Sea as early as 68 ka BP, and the north as late as 55 ka BP. The OMZ expansion/intensification appears to have been interrupted by episodes of increased ventilation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

However, the mean amount of pesticides reaching the water resources varies considerably between regions and depends highly upon application rates, chemical characteristics of pesticides and natural conditions during application. In this study a model was developed which estimates loss of 42 active ingredients applied to 11 field crops, vineyards and orchards along each non-point source path of entry (subsurface drains, runoff and spray drift). A spatially and temporally differentiated data set of application rates and periods was compiled for each active ingredient and target culture to enable the modeling of pesticide transport. The model results are provided in digital raster format (100m x 100m) within a geographic information system (GIS). The calculated pesticide loads in surface waters were compared with measured loads from different catchments in Germany. Both data sets agreed as to the order of magnitude, nevertheless due to the scale of the study the estimated loads cannot be interpreted as absolute values and only differences between active ingredients, regions and application periods should be assessed.

        "Absrtact": "Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems are characterized by a diverse community of native groundcover species. Critics of plantation forestry claim that loblolly (Pinus taeda) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii) forests are devoid of native groundcover due to associated management practices. As a result of these practices, some believe that ecosystem functions characteristic of longleaf pine are lost under loblolly and slash pine plantation management. Our objective was to quantify and compare vegetation composition and structure of longleaf, loblolly, and slash pine forests of differing ages, management strategies, and land-use histories. Information from this study will further our understanding and lead to inferences about functional differences among pine cover types. Vegetation and environmental data were collected in 49 overstory plots across Southlands Experiment Forest in Bainbridge, GA. Nested plots, i.e. midstory, understory, and herbaceous, were replicated four times within each overstory plot. Over 400 species were identified. Herbaceous species richness was variable for all three pine cover types. Herbaceous richness for longleaf, slash, and loblolly pine averaged 15, 13, and 12 species per m2, respectively. Longleaf pine plots had significantly more (p < 0.029) herbaceous species and greater herbaceous cover (p < 0.001) than loblolly or slash pine plots. Longleaf and slash pine plots were otherwise similar in species richness and stand structure, both having lower overstory density, midstory density, and midstory cover than loblolly pine plots. Multivariate analyses provided additional perspectives on vegetation patterns. Ordination and classification procedures consistently placed herbaceous plots into two groups which we refer to as longleaf pine benchmark (34 plots) and non-benchmark (15 plots). Benchmark plots typically contained numerous herbaceous species characteristic of relic longleaf pine/wiregrass communities found in the area. Conversely, non-benchmark plots contained fewer species characteristic of relic longleaf pine/wiregrass communities and more ruderal species common to highly disturbed sites. The benchmark group included 12 naturally regenerated longleaf plots and 22 loblolly, slash, and longleaf pine plantation plots encompassing a broad range of silvicultural disturbances. Non-benchmark plots included eight afforested old-field plantation plots and seven cutover plantation plots. Regardless of overstory species, all afforested old fields were low either in native species richness or in abundance. Varying degrees of this groundcover condition were also found in some cutover plantation plots that were classified as non-benchmark. Environmental variables strongly influencing vegetation patterns included agricultural history and fire frequency. Results suggest that land-use history, particularly related to agriculture, has a greater influence on groundcover composition and structure in southern pine forests than more recent forest management activities or pine cover type. Additional research is needed to identify the potential for afforested old fields to recover native herbaceous species. In the interim, high-yield plantation management should initially target old-field sites which already support reduced numbers of groundcover species. Sites which have not been farmed in the past 50-60 years should be considered for longleaf pine restoration and multiple-use objectives, since they have the greatest potential for supporting diverse native vegetation.

        "Absrtact": "This paper reviews the major mechanisms that can give rise to various forms of variability in the ventilatory pattern. First, an elevated controller gain, coupled with the presence of delays and response lags in the chemoreflex loops, can lead to instability in feedback control and give rise to periodic breathing. This form of ventilatory stability can be assessed quantitatively by employing the concept of 'loop gain'. Several different methods of estimating loop gain from steady state or dynamic respiratory measurements are discussed. An inherently stable respiratory control system can also exhibit periodic behavior due to the influence of primary fluctuations in sleep-wake state and other physiological variables, such as cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. Self-sustained, irregular ventilatory fluctuations may be generated by nonlinear dynamic interactions between various components of the respiratory control system, such as the lung vagal afferents and the respiratory pattern generator, or through the propagation of stochastic disturbances around the chemoreflex loops.

        "Absrtact": "Seismic velocity discontinuities are commonly found within the upper 100 km of the mantle lithosphere, with great variability in their depth, lateral extent, and the polarity of velocity jump. Among the more commonly observed is the '80 km' or Hales discontinuity, identified in a variety of tectonic environments, and sometimes associated with seismic anisotropy. Teleseismic receiver functions for Global Seismographic Network station RAYN on the eastern edge of the Arabian Shield contain a strong converted-phase P(H)s that we believe arises from the Hales discontinuity at the depth of 70 km. On the basis of the polarization, azimuthal behavior and frequency dependence of P(H)s, we characterize the Hales discontinuity as marking an upper boundary of a zone of depth-dependent anisotropy within the upper mantle. The RAYN receiver functions indicate a similar zone at the crust-mantle transition at 40 km. Forward modeling in simple one-dimensional anisotropic models indicates that the receiver functions require, assuming hexagonal anisotropy, an inclined symmetry-axis with N-S strike. In our preferred model there are two anisotropic zones bounded, respectively, by the sharp Moho and the Hales discontinuities on the top. Smooth gradients of anisotropic properties extend beneath the discontinuities. Within both zones the anisotropic symmetry axes, indicative of systematic fabric in the olivine-dominated upper mantle material, are oriented along the N-S direction (\u00b110\u00b0), and are tilted from the vertical 50\u00b0toward the south. We propose that these regions of coherent fabric within the upper mantle represent shear zones developed during late Proterozoic continent-continent collision, when the Ar-Rayn tectonic block underwent northward 'escape' along the northern flank of the Najd fault system.

Repair of uracil-DNA is achieved in a base-excision pathway initiated by a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) enzyme of which four families have so far been identified. Family-1 enzymes are active against uracil in ssDNA and dsDNA, and recognise uracil explicitly in an extrahelical conformation via a combination of protein and bound-water interactions. Extrahelical recognition requires an efficient process of substrate location by 'base-sampling' probably by hopping or gliding along the DNA. Family-2 enzymes are mismatch specific and explicitly recognise the widowed guanine on the complementary strand rather than the extrahelical scissile pyrimidine. This allows a broader specificity so that some Family-2 enzymes can excise uracil and 3,N4-ethenocytosine from mismatches with guanine. Although structures are not yet available for Family-3 (SMUG) and Family-4 enzymes, sequence analysis suggests similar overall folds, and identifies common active site motifs but with a surprising lack of conservation of catalytic residues between members of the super-family.

        "Absrtact": "In order to better constrain the extent to which common sulfide minerals will retain their osmium isotopic composition subsequent to crystallization, we have conducted experiments to quantify the diffusion behavior of osmium in pyrite and pyrrhotite. Experiments consisted of either (1) isothermal soaking of diffusion couples consisting of natural pyrite or pyrrhotite crystals packed against powdered Os-bearing Fe-sulfide or (2) 'relaxation' of initially high near-surface osmium concentrations produced in the latter experiments (pyrite only). Osmium penetration into samples was characterized by depth profiling using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) (pyrite) or electron microprobe analyses across sectioned run products (pyrrhotite). Results of the first type of diffusion experiment involving pyrite show only limited osmium penetration into sample surfaces, with the extent of penetration uncorrelated with run duration. Images of pyrite samples using atomic force microscopy show roughening of initially smooth surfaces as a consequence of step formation and suggest that osmium incorporation into the near-surface occurred by solute uptake during step growth and not by volume diffusion. Prolonged (1000+ h) 'relaxation' experiments revealed no additional osmium penetration into pyrite surfaces and based on the depth resolution for RBS, a maximum diffusion coefficient of 2.5X10-23 m2/s at 500\u00b0C was calculated. Experiments involving pyrrhotite over the temperature range of 950-1100\u00b0C showed extensive osmium uptake and osmium concentration gradients that conform with Fickian diffusion behavior. We found that pyrrhotite Fe/S could be varied by changes in the composition of the starting material and osmium source and over the range of Fe/S produced in experiments (molar Fe/S = 0.83-0.90), we observed no systematic variation in the osmium diffusion coefficient. Diffusion coefficients measured parallel to the a crystallographic axis were on average ~ 1.4X higher than values measured parallel to c and regression of the c-axis data yielded the Arrhenius relation: The application of these diffusion data to simple models of diffusive exchange during static or polythermal time-temperature histories is used to assess the conditions under which radiogenic osmium will be retained. During isothermal annealing, calculations indicate that the cores of millimeter-sized spherical pyrrhotite crystals undergoing diffusive exchange with an external osmium reservoir will have their initial compositions perturbed in \u2264 0.5 Ma at temperatures exceeding 400\u00b0C. Pyrite undergoing the same process at 500\u00b0C requires in excess of 10 Ma before crystal cores are affected. The relatively short 'core retention' time-scales for pyrrhotite indicates that this mineral may be prone to isotopic resetting following relatively brief crustal thermal events, thus possibly accounting for the scatter that commonly occurs in Re-Os isochrons generated from massive sulfide samples. Calculated closure temperatures (T(c)) for osmium exchange in pyrrhotite yielded values of 300-400\u00b0C for grain sizes ranging from 10 to 1000 \u03bcm. These values of T(c) are similar to those calculated for Ar retention in biotite, and considerably lower than for Sr in apatite and plagioclase, for example. Such low closure temperatures for pyrrhotite suggest this mineral will date the final stage in the cooling of a magmatic system and possibly be susceptible to open system osmium exchange in the presence of late-stage hydrothermal fluids. This latter result infers that caution be applied when interpreting elevated initial osmium isotopic ratios as a product of crustal assimilation at the magmatic stage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Millsp.), lemon grass (Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees ex Steud.) Wats.), and tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze)] on control of steepland erosion was evaluated in a replicated researcher-managed field experiment, and 12 farmer-managed erosion-runoff plots from 1995 to 1998 across the landscape of the Manupali watershed in Mindanao, the Philippines. Annual soil loss from 42% slopes with superimposed researcher-managed high-value contour hedgerows treatment (45.4 Mg ha-1) was lower by 30% compared to the conventional practice of up-and-down cultivation (65.3 Mg ha-1). Annual soil loss measured in farmers' plots ranged from 1.4 Mg ha-1 to 52.5 Mg ha-1 on slopes ranging from 16 to 65%. Soil pH, organic C, total-N, and P downslope were greater by 7, 28, 13, and 10%, respectively, compared to upslope. Total-N, organic C, soil pH, Mg, and K measured at the end of the experiment in the researcher-managed contour hedgerows plots were lower by 45, 20, 30, 53, and 70%, respectively, compared to initial values. The Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model was used to assess the effects of annual cropping sequences under a contour hedgerow system on slopes ranging from 15 to 65%. The cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.)-tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)-cabbage sequence (the first crop planted in January) resulted in an average simulated annual soil loss of 28.1 Mg ha-1 across slope ranging from 15 to 65%, whereas tomato-cabbage-tomato resulted in an annual simulated soil loss of 98.3 Mg ha-1. The cropping sequence of tomato-cabbage-tomato lost 3.0 Mg ha-1 more soil at 15% slope than did the cabbage-tomato-cabbage sequence, while at 65% slope, the tomato-cabbage-tomato sequence lost 181.2 Mg ha-1 more than the other sequence. On average, two-thirds of the total soil loss occurred during September-December. In order to reduce soil loss and increase productivity in steep sloping lands, high-value contour hedgerows with sequential cropping sequences that include either corn (Zea mays L.) or cabbage rather than tomato during the most erosive period of the year and variable fertility management strategies along the slope positions are suggested. The coincidence of predicted to actual soil loss from farmer-managed plots, based largely upon model development from researcher-managed plots, and the acute awareness instilled amongst farmer cooperators of the magnitude of soil loss, strengthen the argument for farmer participatory research.

Here we focus on stress fields developed in several linear and branched polyolefin melts. Accurate measurement of stress optical coefficients derived from flow induced birefringence has enabled determination of shear and first normal stress difference fields in these polymers in an abrupt entry convergent flow geometry. The progression of stress growth with increase in melt flow rate is also described. The dimensionless stress ratio (centre line tensile stress to slit wall shear stress) has been identified as a quantity which correlates with the relative vortex size in the linear and branched polyolefins. Fully developed entry flows on melt passage into the slit section are also studied and reflect relaxation characteristics of each polymer.",

Background: Modafinil has been shown to be effective and well tolerated for treating EDS associated with narcolepsy in two large-scale, well-controlled, 9-week clinical trials. Methods: Four hundred and seventy eight adult patients with a diagnosis of narcolepsy who had completed one of two 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trials of modafinil were enrolled in two 40-week, open-label, extension studies. A flexible-dose regimen (i.e. 200, 300, or 400 mg daily) was followed in one study. In the second study, patients received 200 mg/day for 1 week, followed by 400 mg/day for 1 week. Investigators then prescribed either 200- or 400-mg doses for the duration of the study. Efficacy was evaluated using Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scores, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study health survey (SF-36). Adverse events were recorded. Data from the two studies were combined. Results: The majority of patients (~75%) received 400 mg of modafinil daily. Disease severity improved in >80% of patients throughout the 40-week study. At weeks 2, 8, 24, and 40, disease severity was 'much improved' or 'very much improved' in 49, 58, 59, and 58% of patients, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SEM) ESS score improved significantly from 16.5\u00b10.2 at open-label baseline to 12.4\u00b10.2 at week 2 and remained at that level through week 40 (P<0.001). Quality of life scores at weeks 4, 8, 24, and 40 were significantly improved versus open-label baseline scores for six of the eight SF-36 domains (P<0.001). The most common treatment-related adverse events were headache (13%), nervousness (8%), and nausea (5%). Most adverse events were mild to moderate in nature. A total of 341 patients (71%) completed the studies. Forty-three patients (9.0%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Conclusions: Modafinil is effective for the long-term treatment of EDS associated with narcolepsy and significantly improves perceptions of general health. Modafinil is well tolerated, with no evidence of tolerance developing during 40 weeks of treatment. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Hyperventilation, producing hypocapnia, is associated with physiological changes in the brain and with subjective symptoms of dizziness, concentration problems and derealization. In this study (N = 42), we examined cognitive performance on a Stroop-like task, following either 3 min of hypocapnic or normocapnic overbreathing. Both overbreathing trials were run on separate days, each preceded by a baseline trial with the same task during normal breathing. More and other symptoms were reported after hypocapnia compared to normocapnia. Also, more errors were made and progressively slower reaction times (RT's) were observed during recovery from hypocapnia. These performance deficits were only found in participants characterized by apneas. The number of symptoms did not correlate with RT's or errors. The pattern of data suggested that hypoxia, as a result of apneas during recovery from hypocapnia, caused the cognitive performance deficit. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

To accommodate the inherent delay imposed by the adjudication process, we used the results of prior adjudication to predict classifications for selected unadjudicated study events in order to conduct 'up-to-date' interim analyses for the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). Rates at which previously adjudicated study events were confirmed as primary event components were used to adjust the Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival and the log-rank statistics. Multiple events for a given subject were weighted according to the probability that prior events would be confirmed. Once all study events were adjudicated, final analyses confirmed the results of the adjusted interim analysis. For monitoring clinical trials with adjudicated endpoint events, models based on prior adjudication histories can be reliably used to predict event classifications for unadjudicated events and support accurate, contemporary interim analyses.

The respondents investigated were more likely to intend to change those areas they are unsatisfied with in this period, were more likely to actually have changed those areas they were unsatisfied with in the last period, and tended to find the areas of their lives they were dissatisfied with less important. The relationships were not very strong though and were more reliable for the German data set than for the Russian data set.

In the complexes of serine proteases and their proteinaceous inhibitors, recognition is governed mainly by residue P1 in accord with primary serine protease specificity. The bifunctional soybean Bowman-Birk inhibitor (sBBI) should, therefore, interact at LysI16 (subdomain 1) with trypsin and at LeuI43 (subdomain 2) with chymotrypsin. In contrast with this prediction, a 2:1 assembly with trypsin was observed in solution and in the crystal structure of sBBI in complex with trypsin, determined at 2.3 \u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement. Strikingly, P1LeuI43 of sBBI was fully embedded into the S1 pocket of trypsin in contrast to primary specificity. The triple-stranded \u03b2-hairpin unique to the BBI-family and the surface loops surrounding the active site of the enzyme formed a protein-protein-interface far extended beyond the primary contact region. Polar residues, hydrophilic bridges and weak hydrophobic contacts were predominant in subdomain 1, interacting specifically with trypsin. However, close hydrophobic contacts across the interface were characteristic of subdomain 2 reacting with both trypsin and chymotrypsin. A Met27Ile replacement shifted the ratio with trypsin to the predicted 1:1 ratio. Thus, the buried salt-bridge responsible for trypsin specificity was stabilised in a polar, and destabilised in a hydrophobic, environment. This may be used for adjusting the specificity of protease inhibitors for applications such as insecticides and cancer chemopreventive agents. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Within the context of landscape variation in habitat quality, areas of unusually high productivity may serve as refuges for fauna during environmentally stressful periods and as sources of recruitment into less productive areas. In dry landscapes, water availability often defines habitat quality, so that drainages that concentrate run-off can facilitate relatively lush, and sometimes distinct, vegetation communities. The dry box-ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia may be such an ecosystem. Recent clearing of vegetation for agriculture and mining has eliminated 85% of the original vegetation in this area, with the fertile, alluvial soils being most affected. Fragmentation and degradation of remnant forest in this ecosystem has increased the potential importance of the remaining high-quality habitat to conservation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the abundance of mammals was higher in moist gullies than on dry hilltops, slopes and ridges in the box-ironbark forests of central Victoria. We compared 57 spatially paired gully and ridge sites. Habitat analyses indicated that gullies had a tree canopy height that was 51% taller than on ridges. 53% more trees with hollows in the upper bole and branches, and almost six times more very large trees. Ridges had 71% more small trees than gullies. Among marsupials surveyed, the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula and common ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus were significantly more abundant in gullies. Nearly all the reproduction observed in these two species occurred in gullies. The yellow-footed antechinus Antechinus flavipes was also significantly more abundant in gullies; numbers of the sugar glider Petaurus breviceps differed little. Whereas gullies occupy a very limited total area in this ecosystem, they may nonetheless be critical to some species of mammals that can survive in dry habitats but thrive only in mesic areas. Given the precariously degraded state of the box-ironbark ecosystem as a whole, protection of gullies from proposed alluvial gold mining and timber harvesting could have a disproportionate benefit to biodiversity conservation. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Data on several different horse populations were analysed and compared regarding length of life and diseases or injuries leading to death or culling. In order to include information for horses still alive, a failure time (survival) analysis was used. The first material included 1847 warmblood horses born between 1968 and 1982, that had participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test (RHQT) as 4-year-olds. The next two materials included 344 warmblood and 204 coldblood horses owned by the Swedish Cavalry Horse Foundation (CHF), born between 1970 and 1975. The last population consisted of 481 warmblood brood-mares born between 1965 and 1967. According to this study it was important to estimate the median length of life separately for each sex. For warmblood brood-mares and mares that had participated in the RHQT, comparable figures of 18.6 and 18.3 years were found. Close agreement was also found between geldings of the CHF and males that had participated in the RHQT; the estimates were 14.7 and 13.9 years, respectively. There was a positive trend in the median length of life over time for horses that had participated in the RHQT, and the median length-of-life curve increased more steeply for mares than for males. This study showed a longer median length of life for coldblood geldings, 17.6 years, than for the mares, 16.4 years. The most common causes of death of warmblood horses were diseases of the musculoskeletal system (56-57%), respiratory diseases (8-9%), diseases of the digestive system (5-6%) and accidents (3-9%). The primary causes of death of coldblood horses were temperamental disorders (23%), diseases of the musculoskeletal system (14%) and hoof diseases (8%). \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "There are few relationships in the epidemiology of cancer between an exposure and disease that are as consistent as those observed between tobacco and lung cancer. The health consequences of tobacco use are not limited to lung cancer; the 1990 Surgeon General's Report described that the use of cigarettes was the leading cause of avoidable mortality in the United States, with about 434,000 preventable deaths per year. Although a majority of the adults in the United States are current or former smokers, smoking cessation and prevention efforts have been successful, although currently about one in four adults still smoke cigarettes. The decline in ever-smoking has reached a plateau in the past few years, however, and rates of teenage smoking have begun to increase. In 1997, smoking rates among high school students in the United States were 32% higher compared with 1991. As noted by Cinciripini et al, adult smokers who quit or die are being replaced by children who smoke. Until recently, lung cancer control efforts primarily have focused on smoking prevention in youth and cessation among adults, with little obvious potential for reducing deaths through early detection. With the recent publication of early results from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project showing remarkably more favorable screening performance compared with chest radiography, the potential to detect lung cancer early and save lives is being revisited. Ultimately, the preferred disease control strategy is the prevention of lung cancer through the elimination of tobacco use altogether, but for the foreseeable future a legacy of decades of tobacco use in a significant proportion of the US population means we are still challenged to develop public health strategies to reduce deaths and suffering from those destined to develop lung cancer.",

        "Absrtact": "Despite the critical ecological roles of structural complexity, ecologically relevant quantitative measures of structural complexity that allow comparisons among forest stands are still lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a method that allows comparisons of structural heterogeneity among stands. To encompass a broad range of potential structural complexities, we simulated three spatial point patterns each for tree-size distributions from five inventoried natural stands. Forest structure was modeled and analyzed by simulating point patterns of trees and constructing triangular networks to connect neighboring tree tops to one another. This method is based on the concept of spatial tessellation of tree positions, where point patterns are converted into 2-dimensional nearest neighbor triangles. A structural complexity index (SCI) was defined as the sum of the areas of 3-dimensional triangles (with x, y, and z coordinates) divided by the sum of the areas of 2-dimensional triangles. Vertical gradients were defined as the maximum size difference among the trees forming a triangle, that is, the greater the difference, the greater the structure and the larger the SCI value. Patch-types were defined as classes of structural gradients at different positions within the canopy. More patch-types are also indicative of more structurally heterogeneous stands. Both the SCI and the number of patch-types and patch-size heterogeneity related closely to conventional descriptors of forest structure. While the number of patch-types and patch-type heterogeneity related more to the vertical component of structural complexity, SCI integrated well with both the vertical and horizontal structure. SCI and the concept of patch-types complement one another and can be used to quantitatively compare the structure of different stands. The applicability of this modeling approach in characterizing the structural heterogeneity of forests across spatial scales is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The issue of particle size is more difficult to address due to the scarcity of data.

To achieve that target, direct human induced activities initiated in the Land-use Change and Forestry sector since 1990, shall be included. However, the wording in the Protocol has caused confusion. The IPCC has been requested to deliver a Special Report on Land-use, Land-use Change and Forestry issues arising from this Protocol. In the present study a limited initial assessment of the implications of alternative interpretations of Afforestation, Reforestation and Deforestation (ARD), addition of the soils compartment, the selection of additional activities, and feasibility of monitoring was done for a limited number of countries. The results show that it is possible to keep the biosphere articles in the Protocol even though we had to make several assumptions concerning for example, areas of application and effectiveness of additional activities. The consequences of alternative interpretations for ARD have a large impact on the countries' assigned amount; varying from a compensation of 26% of total national emissions (Forestry interpretation for Sweden) to an addition of an extra 13% of the emissions (Global interpretation for Australia). Through selection of a large set of additional activities, most of the studied industrialised countries achieve more sequestration than the reduction of emissions they have committed themselves to. Methods for monitoring are available, but there is no one ideal method. Depending on scale and site: a combination of forest inventory with flux measurements and remote sensing is proposed. \u00a9 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury in the Army. Behaviors increasing risk for motor vehicle crashes are also prevalent, but research has not linked these behaviors directly to injury outcomes (e.g., hospitalizations). Methods: To evaluate the relationship between behavior and motor vehicle crash injuries, 99,981 Army personnel who completed Health Risk Appraisal surveys in 1992 were followed for up to 6 years. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate speeding, seat belt use, drinking patterns, and demographics. Results: A total of 429 soldiers were hospitalized for motor vehicle injury. Unadjusted analyses revealed that heavy drinking, drinking and driving, speeding, low seat belt use, younger age, minority race/ethnicity, and enlisted rank were significantly associated with motor vehicle injury, but neither smoking nor gender was. Multivariate models showed a significant trend of increasing injury risk with younger ages. Soldiers under age 21 were injured almost five times more often than those over age 40 (HR 4.89, 2.56-9.33). Also associated with risk for hospitalizations were minority race (HR 1.78, 1.46-2.18), heaviest drinkers versus abstainers (HR 1.81, 1.11-2.94), and seat belt use of 50% or less versus 100% (HR 1.40, 1.07-1.85). Although nonsignificant, there was evidence of an age-drinking interaction where the difference in injury risk between those older and those younger than 21 was greatest at low alcohol consumption levels. Conclusions: Modifiable risk factors associated with motor vehicle injuries include heavy drinking and low seat belt use. Programs targeting these behaviors that meet the needs of young and minority soldiers are needed. The high density of young, at-risk soldiers residing in base housing may provide a unique opportunity for a residential intervention program.

        "Absrtact": "An exotic trend of positively correlated Cr and Ca occurs in garnet from xenoliths in the Jericho kimberlite, northern Canada. The trend shows significantly less enrichment in Cr with increasing Ca than the common lherzolitic trend characteristic of kimberlite concentrate. The trend is found only in spinel-garnet peridotite xenoliths and is attributed to equilibration of garnet with spinel. The compositional variation of garnet within the trend is calculated to require buffering by equilibria involving Cr-spinel and clinopyroxene. Representation of garnet chemistry in terms of additive and exchange components shows that the chromite-clinopyroxene-garnet equilibrium (CCGE) is controlled by the exchange Mg2Al3 \u21c6 Ca2Cr3. The equilibration of garnet with chromite and clinopyroxene reduces the extent of cation exchange in octahedral sites and eliminates Fe from active substitution in garnet relative to the common lherzolitic trend. A trend similar to the CCGE trend was described for spinel-garnet xenoliths from South Africa and Colorado Plateau and was produced experimentally for natural lherzolite compositions at high P-T conditions. The fact that the trend is extremely rare is explained by its low visibility and/or the lack of Ca-saturation in most spinel-garnet cratonic peridotite. The CCGE trend is more pronounced in garnet from peridotite xenoliths than in garnet from kimberlite concentrate where it is less visible due to sampling biases and dilution. The paucity of Ca-saturation results from harzburgitic composition of peridotitic mantle at depths of 120-180 km (spinel-garnet facies) under most Archean cratons. The Jericho and Colorado Plateau mantle segments are unique in having lherzolitic composition of the spinel-garnet mantle, where there is sufficient clinopyroxene to ensure the development of the CCGE trend. A CCGE trend in garnet composition reflects the presence of relatively fertile rocks at relatively shallow depths. In the Ca-saturated mantle, the CCGE trend can be used to constrain the depth interval of the mantle sampled by kimberlite. Coupled with the data on kimberlite spinel chemistry and on the local geotherm, the presence of the trend can reveal sampling of non-diamondiferous or diamondiferous mantle horizons.

        "Absrtact": "Major and trace element and radiogenic isotope ratios (Sr, Nd and Pb) are presented for a suite of Neogene to Recent basalts (MgO > 4 wt%) from the axial regions of the Kenya Rift. Samples have compositions ranging from hypersthenenormative basalt through alkali basalt to basanite and are a subset of a larger database in which compositions extend to nephelinite. A broadly negative correlation between Zr/Nb (<2-7) and Ce/Y (1-8) indicates derivation from a garnet-bearing mantle source region as a result of <3% melting. Isotope ratios in basalts from the axial regions of the Kenya Rift have 143Nd/144Nd=0.51300 to 0.51255, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7030 to 0.7055 and 206Pb/204Pb <18 to >20, broadly similar to values from OIB. The Kenya Rift cuts through basement of different ages and aspects of the composition of mafic magmas reflect the anisotropy of the underlying lithosphere. Specifically, those basalts from that part of the rift underlain by the Tanzanian craton (TC) have higher Ce/Y and lower Zr/Nb ratios than those erupted through the Panafrican Mozambique belt (MB) implying an origin either at greater depth or from a more trace element-enriched source region. Samples erupted through the zone of reactivated craton margin (RCM) share the characteristics of mafic lavas from both the craton and the mobile belt. MB samples have 143Nd/144Nd = 0.5130-0.5127, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7030-0.7035 and 206Pb/204Pb = 18.3-19.8, defining a steep negative trend on the Nd-Sr diagram and plotting close to the NHRL on conventional Pb isotope diagrams. By contrast TC and RCM samples have 143Nd/144Nd = 0.5124-0.51275, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7035-0.7056 and 206Pb/204Pb = 17.6-21.2, defining flat-lying arrays on Nd-Sr plots and a much greater scatter and spread on Pb isotope diagrams, with many analyses plotting above the NHRL. Both groups of analyses trend towards a common end member on a plot of 143Nd/144Nd against 87Sr/86Sr, at 143Nd/144Nd ~ 0.51275 and 87Sr/86Sr ~ 0.7035. These values are suggested to reflect the isotopic characteristics of the sub-lithospheric Kenyan mantle, inferred to be the Kenya mantle plume. Comparison with data from Afar suggest that the Kenya plume is distinct from the Afar plume, implying that the east African Rift is underlain by at least two distinct mantle plumes. Eocene and Oligocene basalts from southern Ethiopia bear a closer resemblance to the Kenyan basalts than to those from Afar and the Ethiopian plateau, suggesting that the Kenya plume has been active for at least 45 Ma. Migration of magmatism from southern Ethiopia southwards is consistent with the northeastward migration of the African plate over the Kenya plume over the past 50 My. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Differences between conditions were detected with the general linear method (factorial model). Barefoot running is characterized by a significantly larger external loading rate than the shod condition. The flatter foot placement at touchdown is prepared in free flight, implying an actively induced adaptation strategy. In the barefoot condition, plantar pressure measurements reveal a flatter foot placement to correlate with lower peak heel pressures. Therefore, it is assumed that runners adopt this different touchdown geometry in barefoot running in an attempt to limit the local pressure underneath the heel. A significantly higher leg stiffness during the stance phase was found for the barefoot condition. The sagittal kinematic adaptations between conditions were found in the same way for all subjects and at the three running velocities. However, large individual variations were observed between the runners for the rearfoot kinematics. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

As a result of a major excavation of the entrance channel to Pensacola Bay, over 7 million m3 of beach-quality sand were placed long the easternmost 7.5 km of Perdido Key, adjoining the entrance channel at Pensacola Pass. The project included the placement of 4.1 million m3 of sand directly upon the shoreline in 1989-1990, followed by the placement of an additional 3 million m3 as an underwater berm just offshore of the beach nourishment project in water depths of roughly 6 m. Monitoring of the performance of the beach nourishment project and the offshore berm has been conducted since 1989, beginning with a pre-construction survey of the project area. Monitoring surveys have been conducted on an annual or biennial basis since that time, with the most recent survey occurring in July/August, 1998. Over 8 years of monitoring data indicate that the beach nourishment project has retained approximately 56% of the original volume placed within the 7.5-km project length. In addition, according to the latest monitoring survey, the dry beach width of the project, initially constructed as 135 m on average, is still 53 m wider than pre-project conditions. Approximately 41% of the originally placed dry planform area remains as of July 1998.

The performance of both the beach nourishment project and the offshore berm appear to be significantly related to the two storm events, particularly Hurricane Opal, and the proximity of the project to the tidal entrance at Pensacola Pass.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is a complex cardiac lesion that is associated with ventricular septal defect, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and tricuspid valve abnormalities. Nomenclature for this lesion has been variable and confusing. Herein we attempt to clarify the terminology, with an emphasis on identification of synonymous and nonsynonymous appellations.

Additionally, researchers now understand that AD is genetically heterogeneous and that some genetic isoforms appear to have similar or related biochemical consequences. Genetic epidemiologic studies indicate that first-degree relatives of AD probands have an age-dependent risk for AD \u224338% by age 90 years (range 10% to 50%). This incidence strongly suggests that transmission may be more complicated than a simple autosomal dominant trait. Nevertheless, a small proportion of AD cases with unequivocal autosomal dominant transmission have been identified. Studies of these autosomal dominant familial AD (FAD) pedigrees have thus far identified four distinct FAD genes. The \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2APP) gene (on chromosome 21), the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene (on chromosome 14), and the presenilin 2 (PS2) gene (on chromosome 1) gene are all associated with early-onset AD. Missense mutations in these genes cause abnormal \u03b2APP processing with resultant overproduction of A\u03b242 peptides. In addition, the \u03b54 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is associated with a increased risk for late-onset AD. Although attempts to develop symptomatic treatments based on neurotransmitter replacement continue, some laboratories are attempting to design treatments that will modulate production or disposition of A\u03b2 peptides.

        "Absrtact": "When an accidental release of a hazardous material is considered within a safety case or risk assessment, its off-site effects are generally assessed by calculating the dispersion of vapour from the site. Although most installations handling flammable materials will be in the open air, many types of plant, particularly those handling toxics, are enclosed, partly to provide some form of containment and hence, to mitigate the effects of any release. When such a release occurs within a building, the gas or vapour will undergo some mixing before emerging from any opening. The degree of mixing will depend upon the building geometry and the nature of the ventilation, which in turn may be modified by the leak. This situation is considered in this paper, with specific application to calculating the rate of release of a dense vapour from a building. The paper describes the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to modelling the release and mixing processes within buildings. Examples of validation calculations for simple geometric arrangements, as well as more complex geometries representative of an industrial site, are described. The results demonstrate the capabilities of CFD for this application but highlight the need for careful modelling of the near-wall flows and heat transfer, and need for an accurate fluid dynamics and thermodynamic representation of the release source.

This paper focuses principally on the biological record and describes recent research that aims to reconstruct (i) past variability in effective moisture, and (ii) past variability in temperature. Changes in effective moisture are manifested especially by changes in lake water level. In closed lake basins water level change can cause significant changes in water salinity that is registered in sediments by changes in the composition of fossil assemblages, especially diatoms. In open (freshwater) lake basins changes in water level are best reconstructed from the aquatic macrofossil record and potentially from the ratio of open water to littoral species of Cladocera, ostracods and diatoms. The most promising biological method for reconstructing past temperature is chironomid analysis, and a range of new chironomid-temperature transfer functions are being developed. However, biological responses to changing temperature are usually indirect as a result of temperature effects on water-column stratification, nutrient cycling and alkalinity generation, and in most cases a correct interpretation of the climatic significance of changes in the fossil record requires an understanding of the processes that are operating in the water column. A multi-proxy, whole-lake approach is advocated as the best way forward, not only as a means of reconstructing past climate but also as a means of assessing the impact of climate change on lake systems.",

        "Absrtact": "Species richness, or simply the number of species in a given area, is commonly used as an important indicator of biological diversity. Spatial variability in species richness has been postulated to depend upon environmental factors such as climate and climatic variability, which in turn may affect net primary productivity. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been shown to be correlated with climatic variables including rainfall, actual evapotranspiration and net primary productivity. To determine factors favoring high species richness, we examined the relationship between interannual NDVI variables and species richness of birds at a quarter degree scale (55 \u00d7 55 km). Results revealed a strong positive correlation between species richness and maximum average NDVI. Conversely, species richness showed negative correlation with standard deviation of maximum NDVI and the coefficient of variation. Though these relationships are indirect, they apparently operate through the green vegetation cover. Understanding such relationships can help in mapping and monitoring biological diversity, as well as in estimating changes in species richness in response to global climatic change.",

        "Absrtact": "Proteins might have considerable structural similarities even when no evolutionary relationship of their sequences can be detected. This property is often referred to as the proteins sharing only a 'fold'. Of course, there are also sequences of common origin in each fold, called a 'super-family', and in them groups of sequences with clear similarities, designated 'family'. Developing algorithms to reliably identify proteins related at any level is one of the most important challenges in the fast growing field of bioinformatics today. However, it is not at all certain that a method proficient at finding sequence similarities performs well at the other levels, or vice versa. Here, we have compared the performance of various search methods on these different levels of similarity. As expected, we show that it becomes much harder to detect proteins as their sequences diverge. For family related sequences the best method gets 75% of the top hits correct. When the sequences differ but the proteins belong to the same superfamily this drops to 29%, and in the case of proteins with only fold similarity it is as low as 15%. We have made a more complete analysis of the performance of different algorithms than earlier studies, also including threading methods in the comparison. Using this method a more detailed picture emerges, showing multiple sequence information to improve detection on the two closer levels of relationship. We have also compared the different methods of including this information in prediction algorithms. For lower specificities, the best scheme to use is a linking method connecting proteins through an intermediate hit. For higher specificities, better performance is obtained by PSI-BLAST and some procedures using hidden Markov models. We also show that a threading method, THREADER, performs significantly better than any other method at fold recognition. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "The Jalama pluton (JP) is one of the best examples of the late Hercynian two-mica granites of the Central-Iberian Zone (CIZ) of the Hesperian Massif (Spain and Portugal). This pluton is a multiphase intrusion that consists of three intrusive units: (1) the external unit (EU) comprises three main facies [a two-mica coarse-grained porphyritic granite (PG), a two-mica coarse-grained equigranular granite (EG) and a tourmaline-bearing-muscovite leucogranite (TL)] which define both vertical and horizontal zonation. The main petrographic and compositional characteristics of the EU can be explained by a fractional crystallization process that takes place in independent magma batches generated from heterogeneous source rocks; (2) the sillimanite monzogranite (SM) is distinguished by the presence of micaceous aggregates composed of biotite, muscovite and sillimanite. Based on major and trace element data the compositional variability within the SM has been ascribed to inheritance from compositionally heterogeneous source rocks; (3) the late leucogranites (LL) appear mainly as dykes intruded in the PG. From a comparison with this PG, it can be deduced that the LL represent derivative liquids segregated after important fractionation from magmas equivalent to PG magmas but at deeper levels. The most important implication of our study is that the Jalama granites were generated by partial melting of high-grade metamorphic peraluminous rocks that were compositionally heterogeneous on different scales. During this small-scale intracrustal melting event, temperature was the limiting factor for the degree of melting. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

From an ecological point of view the area is highly sensitive and both food security and soil conservation are becoming serious problems for the rapidly growing population. The intensive land cover changes observed in this area during the last few decades beg accurate analysis. Land-cover change analysis over a long time-span was performed. Interpretation (API) of aerial photographs dated 1972 and classification of a 1994 Landsat TM image were used. Problems due to the heterogeneous nature of the data were overcome with a method for quantifying land cover on aerial photographs, thus producing data comparable to TM classification results. As land cover is linked, through land use, to social dynamics, in ground control use was made of the results of parallel socio-economic investigations. From the analysis, a general trend of increase in cultivated surfaces was noted. Unique strategies of land allocation according to physical settings were observed. A trend in the evolution of badlands was identified: rapid reactivation of previous erosion in newly cropped areas occurred; within a few decades this erosion reached quasi-equilibrium. The methods adopted showed some accuracy limitations, but allowed land-cover change analysis over a 22-year time-span, providing important insight into recent phenomena and present trends.",

In this study, I focus on the role of the annual cycles in mixing, sea-surface temperature and biological production. By integrating these cycles, it is shown that the annually integrated flux of CO2 can be written as F = \u03b1(C(T)/(W) - C(Eq)), where F is the mean annual air-sea flux of CO2, \u03b1 is an equilibrium rate constant (m/year), C(T)/(W) is the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in the winter mixed layers and C(Eq) is the dynamic equilibrium concentration for C(T)/(W). In the formula,\u03b1 and C(Eq) capture the influence of the annual cycles as well as the spatial variations in, for example, the alkalinity. I analyze data from the Ocean Weather Stations (OWS) in the North Atlantic and some results from the MIT biogeochemical ocean model to find adequate descriptions of \u03b1 and C(Eq). According to these model/data estimates, the influence of the annual cycles in sea-surface temperature and biological production on the dynamic equilibrium concentration is on the order of - 5 to - 20 and 0-30 \u03bcmol/kg, respectively. These numbers are not negligible showing that the annual cycles must be considered when analyzing the oceanic carbon cycle. The spatial distribution of the quantities C(T)/(W), \u03b1, and C(Eq) are estimated for the North Atlantic using data from the TTO/NAS expedition and a combination of model and data analyses. The air-sea flux is calculated according to the above formula, and the seawards flux is estimated to be 0.4 Gt C/year for the area north of 30\u00b0N. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

QUANNs are also more powerful than CLANNs, again for some of the tasks examined, in terms of what the network can learn. What is more, it appears that not all components of a QUANN architecture need to be quantum for these advantages to surface. It is demonstrated that a fully quantum neural network has no advantage over a partly quantum network and may in fact produce worse results. Overall, this work provides a first insight into the expected behaviour of individual components of QUANNs, if and when quantum hardware is ever built, and raises questions about the interface between quantum and classical components of future QUANNs.",

In the scheme we propose, the boundary is extracted using a constrained mesh surface which iteratively approximates a 3D point set consisting of detected boundary points.

        "Absrtact": "A large number of lithological borehole descriptions, 14C dates, archaeological artefacts, and gradients of palaeochannels were used to reconstruct the Holocene development of the Rhine-Meuse delta. Data were stored in a Geographical Information System database that enables generation of palaeogeographical maps for any time during the Holocene. The time resolution of the palaeogeographic reconstruction is about 200 years. During the Holocene, avulsion was an important process, resulting in frequent shifts of areas of clastic sedimentation. Palaeogeographic evolution of the Rhine-Meuse delta is mainly governed by complex interactions among several factors. These are: (1) Location and shape of the Late Weichselian palaeovalley. (2) Sea-level rise, which resulted in back-filling of the palaeovalley. (3) Peat formation, which was most extensive in the western part of the back-barrier area especially between 4000 and 3000 14C yr BP. This more or less fixed the river pattern at that time and resulted in few avulsions. (4) Neotectonics. Differential tectonic movements of the Peel Horst and Roer Valley Graben seem to have influenced river behaviour (formation of an asymmetrical meander belt, location of avulsion nodes), especially from 4500 to 2800 14C yr BP when the rate of sea-level rise had decreased. After 2800 14C yr BP, the sea-level rise further decreased, and the tectonic influence still may have influenced avulsions, but from then on, other factors became dominant. (5) Increased discharge, sediment load and/or within-channel sedimentation. After 2800 14C yr BP, river meanders of Rhine distributaries as well as the single channel of the Meuse show remarkable increases in wavelength, interpreted as a result of increased bankfull discharge and sediment load. Increased discharge may initially have been caused by a higher precipitation. After 2000 14C yr BP, both discharge and sediment load seem to have increased as a result of human influence. Alternatively, decreasing gradients (as a result of sea-level rise) may have caused an increased within-channel sedimentation and channel widening, which would also lead to increased meander wavelengths. (6) Composition of the river banks. Meandering river channels tend to adhere to the sandy margins of the Late Weichselian palaeovalley, and a high channel sinuosity is found in areas where river banks consist of sand. (7) Marine ingressions, e.g., the AD 1421 St. Elizabeth's flood, caused large-scale erosion in the southwestern part of the fluvial deltaic plain. (8) Human influence. Since about AD 1100 human influence dominated the palaeogeographic evolution. Rivers were embanked and dredged, meanders were cut off, and for the Meuse, a new distributary canal (the Bergsche Maas) was dug in AD 1904. Discharge distribution over the various channels is strictly controlled nowadays. An unusual feature of the delta is the prolonged existence of the Oude Rijn channel belt.

Observations included: aircraft and satellite remote sensing, H.F. and X-band radar, ship surveys and in situ instruments on the sea bed and at the sea surface.

Associated modelling applications included components simulating: (i) tides and surge currents; (ii) wave evolution; (iii) vertical distributions of turbulence and SPM (suspended particulate matter) and (iv) resulting spatial patterns of sediment transport in the region. Simulations of tidal currents confirmed the accuracy of such models, given accurate fine-resolution bathymetry and appropriate boundary conditions. New developments of WAM, the spectral wave model required for fine-resolution applications in shallow water (described by Monbaliu et al.

A number of additional features pertaining to shallow water are revealed including the sensitivity to specification of wind directions and the excessive temporal spreading of short-lived distant events. Likewise, the application of the generic single-point models for vertical profiles of turbulence and SPM (described by Baumert et al. [Baumert, H., Chapalain, G., Smaoui, H., McManus, J.P., Yagi, H., Regener, M., Sundermann, J., Szilagy, B., 2000.

This volume]), are tested and also shown to be appropriate for simulating localised resuspension of SPM. This simulation also illustrates how, in shallow water (< 15 m), tidal and wave dynamics interact with significant mutual adjustments and with first-order influence on stress at the sea bed and thereby erosion and suspension processes. Some preliminary simulations of net sediment movement are included, involving an integration of the above effects. These simulations emphasise how, in all but the shallowest water, the mobility of coarse grain sediments is limited to occasions of extreme waves. By contrast, the movement of fine sediments follows that of the residual tidal current streamlines, i.e., primarily longshore with attendant cross-shore dispersion. However, significant variation between closely-spaced observations indicates the irregularity and complexity of such distributions. It is concluded that because of the inability to prescribe the spatial distribution of available surficial sediments (including size distributions) such simulations can only be expected to reproduce the essential statistical characteristics of SPM concentrations. The availability of extensive remote sensing or in situ data can help to circumvent this problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

For this study, the Holderness coast was chosen. The essential characteristics of the tidal and wave dynamics including their interactions were determined. These components were then incorporated into a single-point model of turbulence intensity and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations. Finally, a preliminary two-dimensional (2D) model of SPM transport off Holderness was established.",

        "Absrtact": "A primitive equation, hydrostatic, terrain-following coordinate ocean general circulation model (OGCM) is used to investigate the mean water mass pathways from the subtropics to the tropics in the Atlantic Ocean. The OGCM is used in a fully realistic configuration of the Atlantic, from 30\u00b0S to 65\u00b0N, with realistic bathymetry. Surface forcings are provided by the COADS climatology. A non-eddy-resolving numerical simulation is analyzed with 3/4\u00b0horizontal resolution and 20 terrain-following vertical levels. The primary objective of this study is to assess the theoretical framework extending the ventilated thermocline theory to the equator in the context of the numerical calculation, and to establish whether the predictions of a steady-state theory can be verified in a time-dependent simulation, in which rectified seasonal effects on the time mean yearly circulation may be important. The Bernoulli function is evaluated on isopycnal surfaces outcropping in the subtropics in both hemispheres and floats are injected at different northern and southern latitudes. In both hemispheres, the interior flow velocities are parallel to the Bernoulli streamlines that are significantly modified by inertia only very near the equator and on the Equatorial UnderCurrent (EUC). In the Northern Atlantic, pathways from the subtropics to the tropics exist for the isopycnal surfaces outcropping at 20-22\u00b0N. The injected floats reach the EUC following a zigzag pattern determined by the tropical current system. It is impossible to distinguish between the western boundary and the interior exchange windows as they are merged together forming a broad exchange pathway east of the northwestward flowing North Brazil Current (NBC). This exchange window disappears for the floats injected north of ~30\u00b0N, and corresponding outcropping isopycnals \u03c30 > 25.5 kg/m3, where only the recirculating window of the subtropical gyre remains. In the Southern Atlantic, all the floats injected between 6\u00b0and 15\u00b0S migrate to the western boundary where they are entrained in the NBC. There is no interior exchange window. At the equator, some are directly entrained into the EUC, some overshoot and retroflect at ~ 8\u00b0N, then join the EUC. As the numerical simulation is carried out under surface forcings that include the seasonal cycle, we can assess the impact of the seasonal cycle on the steady-state analysis. The most important effect is due to the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which in summer is strong, and produces an 'island' of Ekman upwelling between 10\u00b0and 20\u00b0N, which is reflected in the yearly mean properties. The ICTZ-induced upwelling and interior stratification support a corresponding 'island' of high potential vorticity that penetrates in depth to all the isopycnals outcropping between 20\u00b0and 25\u00b0N. This high potential vorticity island creates a barrier that constrains the floats injected at and north of 20\u00b0N to flow around it to reach the Equator and the EUC. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The detrital age spectrum of Lower Triassic samples differ from underlying units in lacking Archean and post-Mesoproterozoic detritus. The Archean Yilgarn craton has previously been envisaged as the main source of detritus in the Perth basin. The bulk of the detritus, however, is of Mesoproterozoic age, which together with the overall broad spectrum of age ranges within individual samples indicates that the detritus was derived from multiple sources. Potential source regions recognized include the Yilgarn craton, the Mesoproterozoic Albany Fraser Orogen, the Meso- to Neoproterozoic Leeuwin complex of the Pinjarra orogen, and probably also the late Mesoproterozoic Northampton complex of the Pinjarra orogen. In addition, source terranes possibly associated with Greater India and East Antarctica, which originally formed the western and southern margins of the basin, may have also contributed detritus accounting for the input of material whose age cannot be related to the known age ranges in currently exposed bounding source blocks. The multi-sourced nature of the detritus suggests the Perth basin was not a simple half-graben structure down stepping to the west but contained a variety of uplifted blocks with an overall longitudinal supply of detritus from the south. The distribution of exposed source blocks changed dramatically at the start of the Triassic with the cessation of input from Archean and Neoproterozoic source regions. The differing age spectra between Triassic and Permian strata and between Late Permian and older sequences suggest any reworked detritus is of extra-basinal origin and not related to intra-basin erosion of underlying rock units. Potential sources for this reworked multicycle detritus are the metasedimentary sequences within the bounding source terranes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

One known atmospheric source is the formation of N2O on three-way motor vehicle catalytic converters followed by emission with the exhaust. Previous estimates of the magnitude of this N2O source have varied widely. Two methods employing tunable infrared lasers to measure N2O/CO2 ratios from a large number of on-road motor vehicles have been developed. Both methods add support to lower estimates of N2O emissions from the US motor vehicle fleet, although significant uncertainty remains. Main Abstract: Two tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS) techniques have been used to measure the N2O emission levels of on-road motor vehicle exhausts. Cross road, open path laser measurements were used to assess N2O emissions from 1361 California catalyst equipped vehicles in November, 1996 yielding an emission ratio of (8.8 \u00b1 2.8) x 10-5 N2O/CO2. A van mounted TILDAS sampling system making on-road N2O measurements in mixed traffic in June, 1998 in Manchester, New Hampshire yielded a mean N2O/CO2 ratio of (12.8 \u00b1 0.3) x 10-5, based on correlated N2O and CO2 concentration peaks attributed to motor vehicle exhaust plumes. The correlation of N2O emissions with vehicle type, model year and NO emissions are presented for the California data set. It is found that the N2O emission distribution is highly skewed, with more than 50% of the emissions being contributed by 10% of the vehicles. Comparison of our results with those from four European tunnel studies reveals a wide range of derived N2O emission indices, with the most recent studies (including this study) finding lower values.

        "Absrtact": "Research with respect to release rates of Al and Al concentrations in the soil solution has led to two contrasting hypotheses, stressing either the importance of kinetically constrained dissolution reactions or the role of complexation of Al to soil organic matter. The existence of two contrasting hypotheses is partly due to the fact that the interpretation of existing results is hampered by the lack of specificity of the extractants used to quantify the organic and inorganic pools of Al and by the fact that simultaneous measurements on the release of Al and the change in Al pools are missing. This study was conducted to obtain more information on the release rates of Al from various amorphous pools and to evaluate the validity of the above hypotheses. To overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings both release rates of Al and changes in the various Al pools were measured during the experiment. Experiments were conducted for Ap, Bs and C horizons from a sandy podzol. Results indicated that Al was released from both the inorganic Al pool (oxalate minus pyrophosphate extractable Al) and the strongly bound organic Al pool (pyrophosphate minus CuCl2, extractable Al) according to a first-order reaction. The decline in the weakly bound organic Al pool (CuCl2 extractable minus adsorbed Al) could be described by a rapid dissolution of part of the pool, combined with an equilibrium reaction describing the complexation of Al to organic sites. Rate constants were highest for the non-complexed part of the weakly bound organic Al pool, intermediate for the inorganic Al pool and lowest for the strongly bound organic Al pool. Large differences exist in rate constants of the organic pools between the three horizons. Differences between the rate constants of the inorganic Al pool for the three horizons were not significant. \u0169 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In order to study and compare forest dynamics in disturbed and undisturbed stands, contrasted silvicultural treatments were performed between 1986 and 1988 in these plots. Taking advantage of this experimental design and of this large database, a forest dynamics modelling project was started in 1992. This paper aims at presenting the growth component of the single-tree, distance-dependent model that was developed within the framework of this project. This individual diameter growth model was built according to the 'potential x modifier' paradigm: it links tree annual diameter increment to variables describing tree size and instantaneous competition as well as the recent past evolution of the competition. Species information was also taken into account and resulted: (i) in the classification of tree species into 15 functional groups that are homogeneous for diameter growth; and (ii) in a definite improvement of model efficiency. Attempts to further reduce the residual variance through the use of soil and topographical information remained unsuccessful. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

As wash load is a non-capacity load it often is modelled using empirical relations, such as the rating curve technique. Sediment rating curves in thee form of a power function are derived for several locations along the river Rhine and its main tributaries, using different fitting procedures. Inaccuracies in estimated sediment loads are analysed, and spatial differences in the shapes of the fitted rating curves are related to watershed characteristics. Rating curves obtained by least squares regression on logarithmic transformed data underestimate, long-term sediment transport rates by 10-50%. Better estimates are obtained when nonlinear least squares regression is applied. The steepness of the fitted rating curves decreases along the main channel of the Rhine in a downstream direction. Contrary to what is generally believed this is not related to changes in the sediment transport regime. A better indication of the sediment transport regime is obtained when the slope/intercept pairs of the fitted rating curves are plotted in a graph. All locations that plot on the same line have a common discharge-concentration value and appear to be characterised by a similar sediment transport regime. At locations of which the slope/intercept pairs plot on higher lines, a larger part of the annual sediment load is transported during high discharge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

An 11 Myr sedimentary record at ODP Sites 885/886 at 44.7\u00b0N, 168.3\u00b0W allows the evaluation of how such dust and its sources have changed in response to late Cenozoic climate and tectonics. The extracted eolian fraction contains variable amounts (>70%) of clay minerals with subordinate quartz and plagioclase. Uniform Nd isotopic compositions (\u03b5(Nd) = -8.6 to -10.5) and Sm/Nd ratios (0.170-0.192) for most of the 11 Myr record demonstrate a well-mixed provenance in the basins north of the Tibetan Plateau and the Gobi Desert that was a source of dust long before the oldest preserved Asian loess formed. \u03b5(Nd) values of up to -6.5 for samples <2.9 Ma indicate \u226435 wt% admixture of a young, Kamchatka-like volcanic arc component. The coherence of Pb and Nd in the erosional cycle allows us to constrain the Pb isotopic composition of Asian loess devoid of anthropogenic contamination to 206Pb/204Pb = 18.97 \u00b1 0.06, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.67 \u00b1 0.02, 208Pb/204Pb = 39.19 \u00b1 0.11. 87Sr/86Sr (0.711-0.721) and Rb/Sr ratios (0.39-1.1) vary with dust mineralogy and provide an age indication of ~250 Ma. 40Ar/39Ar ages of six dust samples are uniform around 200 Ma and match the K-Ar ages of modern dust deposited on Hawaii. These data reflect the weighted age average of illite formation. Changes from illite\u2265smectite with significant kaolinite to illite- and chlorite-rich, kaolinite-free assemblages since the late Pliocene document changes in the intensity of chemical weathering in the source region. Such weathering evidently did not disturb the K-Ar systematics, and only induced scatter in the Rb-Sr data. We propose that when smectite forms at the expense of illite, K and Ar are quantitatively lost from what becomes smectite, but are quantitatively retained in adjacent illite layers. 40Ar/39Ar age data, therefore, are insensitive to smectite formation during chemical weathering but date the diagenetic growth of illite, the major K-bearing phase in the dust. Over the past 12 Myr, the dust flux to the north Pacific increased by more than an order of magnitude, documenting a substantial drying of central Asia. This climatic change, however, did not alter the ultimate source of the dust, and neoformational products of chemical weathering always remained subordinate to assemblages reworked by mechanical erosion in dust deposited in eastern Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

Average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are low during the last glacial (averages prior to 13,000 years: 11-15 \u00b0C), vary rapidly at the beginning of the Holocene, and increase to 17-18 \u00b0C at all sites during S1 formation (dated between 9500 and 6600 calendar years). The modern temperature gradient (2-3 \u00b0C) between the Mediterranean sub-basins is maintained during formation of sapropel S1 in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. After S1, SSTs have remained uniform in the Alboran Sea at 18 \u00b0C and have fluctuated around 20 \u00b0C in the Ionian and Levantine Basin sites. The \u03b418O of planktonic foraminifer calcite decreases by 2\u2030 from the late glacial to S1 sediments in the Ionian Basin and by 2.8\u2030 in the Levantine Basin. In the Alboran Sea, the decrease is 1.7\u2030. Of the 2.8\u2030 decrease in the Levantine Basin, the effect of global ice Volume accounts for a maximum of 1.05\u2030 and the temperature increase explains only a maximum of 1.3\u2030. The remainder is attributed to salinity changes. We use the temperature and salinity estimates to calculate seawater density changes. They indicate that a reversal of water mass circulation is not a likely explanation for increased carbon burial during S1 time. Instead, it appears that intermediate and deep water formation may have shifted to the Ionian Sea approximately 2000 years before onset of S1 deposition, because surface waters were as cold, but saltier than surface water in the Levantine Basin during the Younger Dryas. Sapropel S1 began to form at the same time, when a significant density decrease also occurred in the Ionian Sea. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Several residues in the BC loop and in the neighbouring secondary structural elements display fast local dynamics in the absence of phosphotyrosine peptide ligand as evidenced by below-average [1H]-15N NOE values. Furthermore, residue Gln41 (BC3) displays conformational exchange phenomena as indicated by an above-average R2 relaxation rate. Upon binding of the phosphotyrosine peptide, the NOE values increase to values observed for regular secondary structure and the exchange contribution to the R2 relaxation rate for Gln41 (BC3) vanishes. These observations indicate a loss of backbone flexibility upon ligand binding. Substantial exchange contributions for His56 (\u03b2D4) and Cys57 (\u03b2D5), which are known to make important interactions with the ligand, are attenuated upon ligand binding. Several residues in the \u03b2D-FB region and the BG loop, which contribute to the ligand binding surface of the protein, exhibit exchange terms which are reduced or vanish when the ligand is bound. Together, these observations suggest that ligand binding is accompanied by a loss of conformational flexibility on the ligand binding face of the protein. However, comparison with other SH2 domains reveals an apparent lack of consensus in the changes in dynamics induced by ligand binding. Exchange rates for individual residues were quantified in peptide-complexed p85\u03b1 C-SH2 from the dependence of the-exchange contributions on the CPMG delay in an R2 series and show that peptide-complexed p85\u03b1 C-SH2 is affected by multiple conformational exchange processes with exchange rate constants from 102 s-1 to 7.103 s-1. Mapping of the exchange-rate constants on the protein surface show a clustering of residues with similar exchange-rate constants and suggests that clustered residues are affected by a common predominant exchange process.

In the Early Paleocene, during North Atlantic break-up, the basin was covered by a thick volcanic pile. Subsequently, uplift and erosion took place over the whole region. The volcanic cover was completely removed from Jameson Land and erosion cut deeply into the underlying sediments. To assess the exploration potential of Jameson Land, a basin modelling study with 21 1D pseudo-wells was carried out based on all seismic and surface data available. In addition to the calculation of hydrocarbon generation in space and time, the basin modelling provided an opportunity to study the magnitude and timing of uplift and erosion. Basin modelling constrained by apatite fission track data has made it possible to determine a consistent uplift and erosion history of the area. Tectonic backstripping based on a simple Airy type isostatic model has been used to separate the tectonic uplift from the actual uplift. The combined basin modelling and backstripping study has led to the following conclusions: (1) the thickness of the Cretaceous succession varied from 1.3 km in the south to 0.3 km in the north; (2) the volcanic rocks formed a wedge with a thickness of > 2 km in the south thinning to < 0.1 km in the north; (3) the subsequent erosion of 2-3 km is in response to tectonic uplift with a magnitude of ~ 1 km, and the calculated tectonic uplift shows increasing values to the north. The erosion rate generally accelerated from Late Paleocene up to the present time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In contrast to previous studies that emphasize only the flexibility dimension of AMT, this study adopts a multidimensional view of AMT by stressing the information processing capability inherent in AMTs. The study found support for four dimensions of AMT: information exchange and planning technology (IEPT), product design technology (PDT), low-volume flexible automation technology (LVFAT), and high-volume automation technology (HVAT). The results found also indicate empirical support for the study's major premise that a fit between certain strategy-AMT dimensions will be associated with superior performance.

        "Absrtact": "This paper discusses the effects of organic carbon oxidation on the dissolution and precipitation of calcium carbonate (aragonite and calcite) in fine-grained continental shelf and slope sediments, using data obtained during the Canadian Joint Global Ocean Flux Study program in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the Scotia shelf. The oxygen-penetration depth in these sediments is on the order of 10-15 mm, indicating that organic carbon is mineralized aerobically within this interval. Below this depth, organic matter degradation proceeds mostly through anoxic mineralization processes. The organic carbon content of these sediments decreases smoothly with depth. At all sites, the bottom water is supersaturated with respect to calcite. However, in most cores, immediately below the sediment-water interface, the acidity produced by the aerobic degradation of organic matter is sufficient to overcome the supersaturation of the overlying waters and induce CaCO3 dissolution. This is most strongly reflected by an increase in the porewater calcium concentration near the sediment-water interface. Deeper in the cores, the saturation state of the porewaters increases at depth as a result of alkalinity generation by sulfate reduction and CaCO3 of precipitates. Unlike organic carbon, the inorganic carbon content of the sediments therefore varies little or even increases with depth because what is lost through dissolution near the sediment-water interface is replaced at depth by precipitation. The carbon precipitated as CaCO3 in the sulfate-reduction zone originates in part from the organic carbon, resulting in the preservation of a fraction of the original organic carbon as inorganic carbon. The precipitation of CaCO3 in the anoxic zone creates an additional source of CO2 to the porewaters. The geochemical significance of this source is discussed.",

        "Absrtact": "The Hong'an region in the Qinling-Dabie collisional zone in eastern China hosts a series of metamorphic rocks exposing a south-to-north distribution from blueschist/blueschist-greenschist, amphibolite, eclogite (kyanite free) and kyanite-eclogite to coesite-eclogite facies rocks that represent progressively deeper levels of the Mesozoic subduction-collision complex. The Hong'an area is interesting for three reasons: (1) it escaped the thermal and structural overprint imparted on much of the Dabie Mountains during Early Cretaceous intrusion of voluminous granites and granodiorites; (2) the high-pressure (HP) Hong'an eclogites are widely distributed, often preserve prograde crystallization histories and can be directly linked in time and space to the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist rocks exposed to the south; (3) the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist facies rocks are generally better exposed than their equivalents in the southeastern Dabie Mountains and offer some opportunity for simultaneous structural and metamorphic analysis. The Hong'an area HP rocks offer perhaps the closest approximation to a preserved snapshot of Mesozoic pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions attending early subduction-exhumation in the region, and are thus essential to generating a coherent picture of the dynamics attending both metamorphism and exposure of the coeval ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks. The purpose of this contribution is twofold: (1) to document previously unpublished metamorphic and structural data characterizing these HP sequences and their relative continuity in Hong'an; (2) to incorporate these data with recent geochronologic, structural and paleomagnetic information in the context of protracted, late Paleozoic through Mesozoic subduction, collision and exhumation. Metamorphism and exhumation of some of the southern Hong'an HP sequences appear to have occurred concomitant with oceanic subduction immediately to the west, and thus may have preceded widespread continental subduction/collision. Moreover, all of the HP-UHP sequences in the region were exhumed before the end of collision between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons at ca. 160 Ma. Exhumation of HP-UHP rocks both before and during continental plate collision is neither novel for central China nor for other HP-UHP zones, but is important to take into account when reconstructing the evolution of such orogens.

In spite of this remarkable fact only very little is known about the sediment distribution in its southern part off the coast of Chile. To increase the knowledge about this region a multiparameter study of the surface sediment distribution along the Chilean continental slope between 27 and 42\u00b0S has been carried out. Detailed analyses of sedimentary data (TOC and carbonate contents, \u03b413C(org), \u03b415N), of the species composition of planktic foraminifera and of the stable isotope composition of the two planktic foraminifera species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (dex.) and Globigerina bulloides reveal a close relation to environmental conditions in the region. The pattern of a southward increase of surface water productivity known from satellite data is closely reflected in the organic carbon and \u03b415N data. Information about the water mass distribution, especially about varying influences of upwelling waters and warmer Subtropical Surface Waters, can be derived from the species composition of the planktic foraminifera, while the stable isotope data provide additional clues about water mass characteristics. High productivity along the Chilean margin north of 40\u00b0S is sustained by coastal upwelling, while further to the south advection of nutrients with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and a significant riverine input fuel the highest productivity found in the study area. This data set will provide the base for future paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic reconstructions of the Southeast Pacific region. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Similar intertidal sediments are found landward of an inter-tidal barrier extending from off Stiffkey to off Wells. The thickness of these deposits, resting either on glacial deposits or directly on Chalk, reaches over 15 m in places, along the line of an original E-W trough or channel. Adequate radiocarbon and other reliable dating of these deposits has proved somewhat difficult to determine, but the earliest are Post-Glacial non-marine deposits as old as 10 000 years BP, with the initiation of marine deposition at c. 7500-6500 years BP at the eastern end of the sector. Apart from the Stiffkey and Morston mainly gravel and sandy 'Meals' barriers, which are resting on top of saltmarsh deposits and probably date back to no more than 670-900 years BP, there are no other sand or shingle deposits, except in drainage channels, anywhere landward of Blakeney Spit. The spit itself is being produced by the erosion of the cliffs east of Weybourne, and the entire Holocene and glacial sequences on its seaward side, rolling the sand and shingle body over landward (at about 1 m per annum), and prograding westward, (at c. 3.5 m per annum) - as indicated by accurate maps constructed over the last 400 years.",

Whereas no constant selectivity pattern is found for diet and size through the period, freshwater tetrapods seem to have been less extinction-prone than terrestrial and marine ones. The Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction had less effect on small, omnivorous, and freshwater families than other ecological categories.

Tectono metamorphic events recognised in the Chewore Inliers occur throughout the Zambezi Belt and alternative models for the history of the Zambezi Belt are presented. Four terranes are recognised in the Chewore Inliers, and contacts between them are observed or inferred to be ductile thrusts, along which juxtaposition of the terranes occurred late in the Pan-African metamorphic cycle (M2, at 526 Ma). The oldest portion of the inliers is a metamorphosed sequence of mafic and ultramafic gneisses with an age of 1393 Ma. These constitute what is tentatively called the Ophiolite Terrane, together with closely associated high-P/moderate T schists possibly represents a suture. The other three terranes (Granulite, Zambezi and Quartzite Terranes) experienced a common history of tectonothermal events but show variable degrees of reworking during the latest tectono metamorphic event (M2). Concordant granitic orthogneisses were emplaced at 1087 Ma into supracrustal sequences. No Pan-African supracrustals are recognised in the Chewore Inliers, which are wholly basement gneisses and quartzites that have been reworked during successive orogenies including the Pan-African Orogeny. A high-T/low-P metamorphic event (M1) of possibly 1068-1071 Ma age, with a minimum age of 943 Ma, was responsible for totally recrystallizing the Granulite Terrane during south to north tectonic transport. M1 mineral parageneses are only preserved as inclusion phases and overgrown fabrics in the other terranes. These other terranes were pervasively recrystallised at high-P/moderate T conditions accompanying a clockwise P-T path related to northeast over southwest tectonic transport and crustal over-thickening during the Pan-African metamorphic cycle (M2) at approximately 526 Ma. Reworking of the Granulite Terrane during M2 was minor, leaving M1 fabrics and mineral assemblages preserved with little recrystallization. M2 orogenesis culminated in the juxtaposition of the terranes, rapid uplift through the thermal peak and eventual slow cooling accompanying a multitude of post-tectonic intrusions; pegmatites at 480 Ma, the Chewore Ultramafic Complex and dolerite dykes. The 830 Ma tectonothermal event involving pervasive syn-tectonic granitic orthogneisses in the south Zambezi Belt is not recognised in the Chewore Inliers, suggesting a localised, possibly extensional, regime restricted to the southern part of the Zambezi Belt at 830 Ma.

        "Absrtact": "The Whitby Mudstone Formation (WMF) and Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF) are both Jurassic organic-rich 'black shale' units containing well-preserved marine organic matter. Despite such gross similarities they exhibit opposite trends in \u03b413C(TOC) versus wt% decarbonated total organic carbon (TOC; r= -0.76 for WMF, and 0.71 for KCF); the \u03b413C(TOC) versus TOC trend also varies geographically within both units. Only the KCF data exhibit a positive correlation between \u03b413C(TOC) and \u03b415N(org) (r=0.76) and the presence of aryl isoprenoids (probable indicators of photic zone anoxia). Maturity differences are insufficient to explain such contrasts. Bulk and compound-specific isotopic variations in the KCF are interpreted largely as a reflection of primary productivity during deposition, rather than a dominantly diagenetic signal due to incorporation of sulphurised carbohydrate. The contrasts between the formations, and the geographic variation in coeval shelf sediments, are explained by a model stressing the relative positions and stabilities of the chemocline, pycnocline, nutricline and euphotic zone, and the effect these have on productivity, CO2 recycling, and bacterial floras.

        "Absrtact": "This paper explores approaches to the problem of spoken document retrieval (SDR), which is the task of automatically indexing and then retrieving relevant items from a large collection of recorded speech messages in response to a user specified natural language text query. We investigate the use of subword unit representations for SDR as an alternative to words generated by either keyword spotting or continuous speech recognition. In this study, we explore the space of possible subword units to determine the complexity of the subword units needed for SDR; describe the development and application of a phonetic recognition system to extract subword units from the speech signal; examine the behavior and sensitivity of the subword units to speech recognition errors; measure the effect of speech recognition performance on retrieval performance; and investigate a number of robust indexing and retrieval methods in an effort to improve retrieval performance in the presence of speech recognition errors. We find that with the appropriate subword units, it is possible to achieve performance comparable to that of text-based word units if the underlying phonetic units are recognized correctly. In the presence of speech recognition errors, retrieval performance degrades to 60% of the clean reference level. This performance can be improved by 23% (to 74% of the clean reference) with use of the robust methods.",

All have noted the shortage of high quality field data from coarse-grained beaches against which to test predictions of longshore transport rates. In this paper, 12 existing formulae were identified as being potentially applicable for coarse-grained sediments and predictions from these formulae are compared using a measured annual transport rate from a shingle beach and a concurrent hindcast wave climate. Two new empirical equations are also derived, one from a numerical model calibrated against the same data set, the other derived from field experiments on coarse grained beaches. Energetics-based equations are found to give reasonable predictions of the shingle transport, despite being derived for sand beaches. In contrast, those dimensional analysis type equations which had been validated using laboratory data, grossly over-predicted the measured transport rates. The most accurate predictions were from formulae previously validated at sites similar to that used for this comparison and therefore require further testing against field data from dissimilar sites. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Since the mid-1980s a previously undescribed disease has affected moose in south-western Sweden. Investigations made to reveal evidence of a viral aetiology have proved unsuccessful. Trace element studies in apparently healthy moose shot during regular hunting suggested a trace element imbalance, with excessive molybdenum uptake causing secondary copper deficiency. The results also indicated a possible chromium deficiency. To verify this hypothesis, an experimental study was performed in male goats fed a semi-synthetic diet for 1.5 years. The animals were kept and treated in four groups: Controls, Cu-deficient group (group 1), Cr-deficient group (group 2), and combined Cu- and Cr-deficient group with additional supplementation of tetrathiomolybdate for 10 weeks at the end of the study (group 3). The present paper presents tissue contents of trace and minor elements, haematology and clinical chemical parameters. Feed consumption and weight development, as well as pathological and histopathological investigations, were also performed in this study, but these results are presented elsewhere. Changes in trace element concentrations were determined by comparing groups 1, 2 and 3 with the control group. Increased concentrations were observed for Al, Ca, Co, Fe, Mo, Pb, Se in the liver; for Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Mo in the kidneys; and for Mn and Mo in the ribs. Considerable accumulation of Mn in ribs seems to be a useful way to determine oxidative stress. Decreases in Mg and P in all organs and blood serum is characteristic of Cu deficiency and molybdenosis. Also the ratio of Ca/Mg was increased as the result of tissue lesions causing an intracellular increase in Ca and decrease in Mg. The trace element changes observed in group 1 were enhanced by the Mo supplementation in group 3, resulting in characteristic patterns, 'spectra' of changes. The alterations were not as remarkable in group 2 as in the two other groups. However, Cr deficiency considerably influenced Al, Co, V and to a smaller extent also Mn in ribs. In groups 1 and 2, only a few minor changes were detected in the haematological parameters, probably caused by increased adrenal activity after transportation of the animals. In group 3, severe anaemia was present but also a leukopenia. For the different clinical chemical parameters measured, all three groups showed changes, explained mainly by the altered activity of enzymes induced by trace element deficiencies and imbalance. Impaired carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was seen in groups 1 and 3, with increased concentrations of glucose, lactate and triglycerides in serum. Increased concentrations of total bilirubin were measured in all three groups (bile stasis was also seen post mortem). A considerably increased concentration of serum urea was found in group 3, although there were no indications of renal insufficiency or dehydration. Regarding hormones, a substantial decrease was seen in thyroxine (T4) in group 3 as a result of the molybdenosis, but a minor decrease was also seen in group 1. Insulin on the other hand showed increased levels in group 3 - and especially in group 2 due to the Cr deficiency but also affected by the molybdenosis. As could be expected, Cu deficiency (groups 1 and 3) caused low levels of caeruloplasmin, secondarily affecting the Fe metabolism in these animals. Protein abnormalities, detected as altered electrophoretic patterns of serum proteins, were also seen mainly in group 3. The findings were also confirmed by multivariate data analysis, where PCA revealed the overall impact of the deficiencies, and PLS regression coefficients indicated the influence on the various analytes.

        "Absrtact": "The Hell's Gate alluvial fan of northern Death Valley has an area of 49.5 km2, a radius of 11.8 km, and a smooth 5-3\u00b0sloping surface interrupted by shallow (<0.5 m), radially aligned gullies 1-4 m wide. Facies analysis of 1-14 m high exposures at 45 sites reveals that the fan is built almost entirely by water-flow processes. Two facies deposited by sheetflooding dominate the exposures from apex to toe. The main one (Facies A), comprising 80-95% of the cuts, consists of sandy, granular, fine to medium pebble gravel that alternates with cobbly, coarse to very coarse pebble gravel in planar-stratified couplets 5-20 cm thick that are aligned parallel to the fan surface. Facies B, comprising 0-10% of the exposures, consists of 10-40 cm thick wedge-planar beds of sandy pebble gravel in backsets dipping 5 to 24\u00b0. Both Facies A and B are produced by infrequent sediment-charged flash floods from the catchment, and accumulate on the fan from supercritical standing waves of an expanding sheetflood. Antidune backsets are deposited during the buildup stage of the standing-wave cycle, and the couplets during the washout stage. The autocyclic growth and destruction of standing waves during a single sheetflood produces 50-250 cm thick sequences of multiple couplets with backsets. Couplets prevail over antidunes due to the selective preservation of deposits of the standing wave washout phase. Three minor facies comprise 5-20% of the fan exposures. The most common one (Facies D) is pebbly cobble gravel in lenticular beds typically 5-25 cm thick that overlie erosional scours into sheetflood deposits. It comprises gravel concentrated in gullies by fine-fraction winnowing of sheetflood units during recessional flood or by secondary overland flows. Though common on the fan surface, this facies is stratigraphically limited. Facies C consists of medium- to very fine-grained eolian sandsheet deposits 5-30 cm thick present on the distal fan in association with gully-fill gravel. It forms by wind reworking of the fan surface, and by sand transport from the adjoining erg. Facies C and D gully-fill and eolian deposits together comprise bounding beds that divide successive sheetflood sequences. They record secondary processes active on the surface between infrequent sheetfloods that mainly aggrade the fan. The fifth fan facies (Facies E) consists of lakeshore gravel deposited along the distal fan when it was transgressed by Lake Manly during latest Pleistocene time. The medial 3.8 km part of the Hell's Gate fan is uplifted and backtilted 1 to 16\u00b0into a tectonic ridge formed during strike-slip motion along the North Death Valley fault. Progressive intrafan unconformities, each likely initiated during one large earthquake, are common in these deposits. Two to eight sheetflood units capped by gully-fill or eolian facies are exposed within unconformity-bounded intervals, indicating that fan-aggrading catastrophic sheetfloods on a given part of fan are 2 to \u22658 times more frequent than earthquakes that cause backtilting.

Thermobarometric estimates indicate UHP, HT peak conditions (2.8-3.2 GPa, 780-840\u00b0C) inconsistent with those of the associated rocks, followed by a complicated exhumation path. The P-T-array of the retrograde path suggests syn-subduction exhumation and tectonic inclusion in a melange with a matrix derived from the accretionary wedge. Partial melting of the subducting slab, which induces tectonic weakening, may be an effective mechanism in detaching and enclosing small eclogite pods in metamorphic terrains.

        "Absrtact": "Many modern techniques for the diagnosis of pathological states in humans and for their subsequent treatment can be posed as nonlinear identification problems of essentially nonlinear dynamic systems or as nonlinear optimal control problems. It can be shown that the linearised versions of such models are inadequate and do not represent at all well the complexity of the problem. Thus, nonlinear estimation and control techniques are required for progress to be made in this field. The aim of this review is to examine some models suggested in the medical literature for the modelling of certain medical treatments and diagnoses. Then examine how these models can be enriched by using Operational Research techniques so that a better control is provided on the diagnosis and the treatment, as well as the formulation of more precise models of the phenomenon. The review will present some applications both therapeutic and diagnostic that have appeared in the literature. Special interest will be bestowed on hyperthermic systems in oncological treatment and glucose-insulin dynamics for diabetic patients, while heart dynamics and magnetic resonance imaging will also receive attention. These applications are good examples to show the advantages of Operational Research methods in this field of endeavour. The outline of the paper is the following. After the introduction, in section two a brief description of nonlinear system models of phenomena will be given, for definitional and descriptive purposes. In section three a discussion of how to apply System theory in the medical field will be presented, together with an analysis of the possible benefits. In section four some applications of dynamical models to medical diagnosis and treatment will be described, while in section five the appropriate conclusions will be stated.",

        "Absrtact": "Carbon and strontium isotope studies of numerous drillcore and outcrop sections within individual Australian Neoproterozoic basins, in a tectonic and sedimentologic framework, have allowed the construction of isotopic records for the interval 830-750 Ma. This, combined with the discovery of a restricted stratigraphic range for the acritarch Cerebrosphaera buickii in mid-Neoproterozoic strata of Australia, makes possible correlation with successions in Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen. That part of the mid-Neoproterozoic succession in Spitsbergen which contains C. buickii was previously considered younger than the Sturtian glacial epoch, but this study has indicated that the Akademikerbreen Group is older than that. A correlation scheme is proposed along five tie lines, and is based on a correlation between Australia and Canada at ~830 Ma, and Australia, Spitsbergen and Namibia at ~760 Ma. The lowest ever recorded seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the upper Shaler Supergroup of Canada (0.70561-0.70670) compare with ratios in evaporites of the ~830 Ma Bitter Springs Formation, Amadeus Basin, Australia (0.70568-0.70720). Comparable \u03b413C(carb) records support a correlation. At about 760 Ma, a correlation is made between the heaviest mid-Neoproterozoic \u03b413C(carb) values of 7.2\u2030 (upper Burra Group, Adelaide Rift Complex) and 8.1\u2030 (Kanpa Formation, western Officer Basin) in Australia, 8.5\u2030 in Spitsbergen (Backlundtoppen Formation, Akademikerbreen Group), and 8.5\u2030 in Namibia (Ombombo Subgroup, Congo Craton). The stratigraphic range of C. buickii in Australia and Spitsbergen supports this correlation. A compilation of \u03b413C(carb) and 87Sr/86Sr records between about 830 and 750 Ma from Australia, Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen reveals numerous negative excursions, which are not associated with preserved glacial deposits. It is necessary, therefore, to consider additional models to the 'Snowball Earth' to explain the large and rapid carbon isotopic excursions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The study of the kinetics of heterogeneous catalyzed reactions consists of three different aspects: kinetics studies for design purposes, kinetics studies of mechanistic details and kinetics as a consequence of a reaction mechanism. The latter aspect is clearly the least explored of the three and it will not become routine until the development and analysis of microkinetic models is automated. Based on a survey of existing microkinetic models of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, three classes of Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanisms are shown to be suitable for microkinetic modeling. The first model consists of an LH mechanism with the quasi-equilibrium approximation and a single, rate-limiting step. For this model detailed kinetic studies are possible and include the analytic determination of reaction rate, surface coverages, reaction orders and activation energy. The second model consists of an LH mechanism with the steady-state (SS) approximation. This model allows the treatment of some kinetic phenomena, which cannot be treated by Model 1. However, the treatment of Model 2 is much more difficult and the data which may be determined analytically from Model 2 are the reaction rate, the surface coverages and the degree of rate limitation. The third model is kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations which allow the modeling of even more mechanistic details, such as surface diffusion and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Analysis of this class of models are limited to numerical simulation. Two appendices present the implementation of a Runge-Kutta (RK) integration of the conversion through an isothermal plug-flow reactor and a KMC simulation of a reaction rate, respectively.",

We use Heston's (1993. Review of Financial Studies 6, 327-343) model as an example, and appraise univariate and multivariate estimation of the model in terms of pricing and hedging performance. Our results, based on the S&P 500 index contract, show dominance of univariate approach, which relies solely on options data. A by-product of this finding is that we uncover a remarkably simple volatility extraction filter based on a polynomial lag structure of implied volatilities. The bivariate approach, involving both the fundamental security and an option contract, appears useful when the information from the cash market reflected in the conditional kurtosis provides support to price long term. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We distinguish 18 features (Z-I) in the \u03b413C(carbonate) and \u03b413C(organic) curves: two intervals of well-defined variation in 87Sr/86Sr; and two peaks in the variation of \u03b434S(sulfate). Newly acquired isotopic data in Australia enable correlation with Canada: the Gillen Member of the Bitter Springs Formation, estimated to be about 840 Ma, is correlated with the upper Shaler Supergroup; the Sturtian glacials, about 700 Ma, with the Rapitan glacials; and the Marinoan glacials, about 600 Ma, with the Ice Brook glacials. We recognize only these two major glaciations, and possibly a third minor glaciation, at 570 Ma. Columns in Poland, Namibia, Iran, and Siberia, and possibly Oman and Mongolia provide correlation by \u03b413C, and in Svalbard, Siberia, Oman, and Mali by 87Sr/86Sr. The inter-glacial (700-600 Ma) peak of \u03b434S(sulfide) enables correlation among Australia, Namibia, and China. Two icehouse states were preceded by massive sequestering of CO2 and accompanied by catastrophic declines in biological productivity. During and immediately after the older, Sturtian, glaciation, the deeper parts of the ocean were anoxic and contained sufficient ferrous iron to sequester very large amounts of sulfur derived from bacterial reduction of sulfate; the evidence suggests that the resultant huge shift in the sulfur isotropic composition was global and accompanied by the reduction of as much as half the sulfate in the anoxic parts of the oceans. The effects of the Pan-African orogeny include mountain building and a high rate of sedimentation, which resulted in the burial of large amounts of organic matter and concomitant oxygenation of the hydrosphere and atmosphere. This reinforced a trend in oxygenation that began before the second, Marinoan, glaciation. A second huge sulfur isotope anomaly accompanies the tectonism, and has been explained previously as possibly resulting from the desiccation and flushing of evolving ocean basins. This may be linked to a remarkable carbon isotope anomaly immediately preceding the Cambrian: the anomaly could be due to release of methane from oceanic clathrates de-stabilized by combined sea level fall and global warming resulting from volcanic release of CO2.

        "Absrtact": "There is lot of excitement with Pattern Recognition methods with high precision, since this problem area is a well-established field of Operations Research (O.R.). Recent work of some researchers has shown that O.R. methods in general and Optimization methods in particular, can be applied to give some very good results. Thus this research area has been won back from the Artificial Intelligence community and is quickly becoming once more a fast growing field in O.R. The aim of this review is to examine the early success of classification methods and Pattern Recognition methods, consider their downfall and examine the new techniques that have been applied to make it like a resurgent Phoenix. It will be shown that optimization methods, if carried out properly, through a formal analysis of their structure and their requirements can achieve correct classification with probability one. Many researchers make it more difficult for themselves by not considering the formalization of the task concerned and so adapt heuristics to the problem. Computational methods taken from the Irvine Repository database on recognition instances will be placed in evidence. The outline of the paper is as follows. After the introduction a historical sketch of the field will be presented. Then in Section 3, the need for formal methods will be argued and various results on formal requirements as convergence etc. will be derived. Many of these formal requirements are of course related to the best-unbiased estimate (b.u.e) requirements in Statistics. In Section 4 some popular algorithms for Pattern Recognition will be presented and their degree of satisfaction of the formal requirements stressed, allowing in Section 5 to present many applications, so that conclusions can be reached in Section 6. It will be found that the satisfaction of the formal requirements is a necessary and sufficient condition to reach recognition with probability one.",

        "Absrtact": "We report the first 39Ar-40Ar ages from the three early basic shield-like massifs of Tenerife, Canary islands, and couple these with detailed major and trace element chemistry to constrain the nature and timing of the mantle melting processes. The massifs have chemically different sources, and independent evolutionary histories. The Teno and Roque del Conde massifs appear chemically to represent the products of single mantle melting cycles, with progressive decrease in mean melt fraction and increase in mean melting depth in younger rocks. The Teno massif (NW) was erupted in a short time period around 6.0-6.4 Ma, while at least the lower half of the Roque del Conde massif (SW) is older than 11 Ma. In contrast, the Anaga massif (NE) is polygenetic, with 39Ar-40Ar ages ranging from 8.0-4.2 Ma, and no simple stratigraphic chemical progression. These ages run counter to published suggestions of progressive younging of Canary shield stages to the southwest. Basic rocks in all three massifs are the result of much deeper melting and smaller melt fractions than equivalent units in Gran Canaria, but nevertheless the melting column must have extended significantly into the spinel facies, requiring substantial disruption of the local lithosphere. The age and melting relationships broadly support the mantle blob model for Canary magmatism proposed by Hoernle and Schmincke (Hoernle, K., Schminke, H.-U., 1993. The role of partial melting in the 15-Ma geochemical evolution of Gran Canaria: a blob model for the Canary hotspot. J. Petrol. 34, 599-626). In all three massifs, extensive fractional crystallisation has taken place at crustal levels so that mean MgO contents are only some 6-7%. The fractionation sequence is olivine-clinopyroxene-magnetite in basaltic compositions, with the involvement of plagioclase, amphibole and apatite only to generate the infrequent more evolved hawaiites to benmoreites. Despite the abundance of basanitic magmas in the Tenerife older massifs, these follow a differentiation trend towards weakly undersaturated benmoreite rather than to phonolite. This probably reflects early crystallisation of magnetite, perhaps resulting from somewhat high oxygen fugacity. The chemical evidence for replenished magma chambers in Tenerife described by Neumann et al. (Neumann, E.R., Wulff-Oedersen, E., Simonsen, S.L., Pearson, N.J., Mart\u00ed, J., Mitjavila, J., 1999. Evidence for fractional crystallisation of periodically refilled magma chambers in Tenerife, Canary Islands. J. Petrol. 40, 1089-1123) is a consequence of treating as a single cogenetic suite the products of several magmatic systems that differ in parental melt fraction. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

        "Absrtact": "Global syntheses of palaeoenvironmental data are required to test climate models under conditions different from the present. Data sets for this purpose contain data from spatially extensive networks of sites. The data are either directly comparable to model output or readily interpretable in terms of modelled climate variables. Data sets must contain sufficient documentation to distinguish between raw (primary) and interpreted (secondary, tertiary) data, to evaluate the assumptions involved in interpretation of the data, to exercise quality control, and to select data appropriate for specific goals. Four data bases for the Late Quaternary, documenting changes in lake levels since 30 14C kyr BP (the Global Lake Status Data Base), vegetation distribution at 18 14C kyr and 6 14C kyr BP (BIOME 6000), aeolian accumulation rates during the last glacial-interglacial cycle (DIRTMAP), and tropical terrestrial climates at the Last Glacial Maximum (the LGM Tropical Terrestrial Data Synthesis) are summarised. Each has been used to evaluate simulations of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21 calendar kyr BP) and/or mid-Holocene (6 cal. kyr BP) environments. Comparisons have demonstrated that changes in radiative forcing and orography due to orbital and ice-sheet variations explain the first-order, broad-scale (in space and time) features of global climate change since the LGM. However, atmospheric models forced by 6 cal. kyr BP orbital changes with unchanged surface conditions fail to capture quantitative aspects of the observed climate, including the greatly increased magnitude and northward shift of the African monsoon during the early to mid-Holocene. Similarly, comparisons with palaeoenvironmental datasets show that atmospheric models have underestimated the magnitude of cooling and drying of much of the land surface at the LGM The inclusion of feedbacks due to changes in ocean- and land-surface conditions at both times, and atmospheric dust loading at the LGM, appears to be required in order to produce a better simulation of these past climates. The development of Earth system models incorporating the dynamic interactions among ocean, atmosphere, and vegetation is therefore mandated by Quaternary science results as well as climatological principles. For greatest scientific benefit, this development must be paralleled by continued advances in palaeodata analysis and synthesis, which in turn will help to define questions that call for new focused data collection efforts.",

One factor identified in the analysis was taken as an indicator of variation in the need for alcohol services as all of the alcohol-related variables loaded strongly on this factor. The distribution of ranks for factor scores (determined through regression) obtained for this 'alcoholness' factor across LGAs in the state showed that scores were highest in non-metropolitan areas as well as inner-suburban Melbourne.

        "Absrtact": "High-quality hydrographic sections occupied during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) have allowed the first estimates to be made of property changes in the deep ocean on a decadal time-scale. The magnitude of the property variability on deep isothermal surfaces (below about 2-3\u00b0C) was found to be comparable with the magnitude of possible systematic errors in the data (except for a few regions where formation of deep and bottom waters occurs). However, the problem of systematic errors in hydrographic data was only marginally addressed in the literature. We conducted an analysis of property offsets between the cruises of an expansive global hydrographic dataset, including 1314 cruises. Because of significant differences in quality, a distinction is made between the high-quality modem data (1970-1998) and less accurate historical data (since 1920s). Inter-cruise offsets are determined on isothermal surfaces for salinity, oxygen, silicate, nitrate and phosphate within crossover areas. Offsets are decomposed into a systematic part (the difference of respective systematic errors (biases)) and a non-systematic part (a combined effect of temporal and spatial variability). For the reference subset of N=384 high-quality cruises with M=2201 crossover areas (for salinity) a system of M algebraic equations in N unknown cruise biases is obtained and solved by least squares. Accounting for biases allows a drastic reduction of inter-cruise offsets (a factor of 2-4 depending on property and dataset considered), bringing data from different cruises to agreement within WOCE quality requirements. For a composite WOCE/non-WOCE high-quality dataset calculated root-mean-square inter-cruise offsets before and after adjustment (in parentheses) are 3.2*10-3 (1.34*10-3) for salinity, 2.498 (0.782) \u03bcmol/kg for oxygen, 2.4 (0.95) \u03bcmol/kg for silicate, 0.55 (0.26) \u03bcmol/kg for nitrate and 0.045 (0.018) \u03bcmol/kg for phosphate. Our results demonstrate, that quality requirements for the WOCE Hydrographic Programme have been obviously fulfilled. Biases for historical cruises are calculated relative to the corrected reference data and are found to be on average a factor of 3-6 larger than the modem cruise biases. Calculated property offsets and biases for both high-quality and historical data are found to be in a good agreement with independent offset estimates. Though small differences of IAPSO Standard Seawater salinity from label salinity are reported in the literature, they can not explain observed inter-cruise offsets, and operator/salinometer related errors seem to be the main cause for inter-cruise differences. Systematic biases can provide an explanation for apparent changes in deep water temperature-parameter relationships as an alternative to natural variability. For instance, we argue that apparent variability of the deep water salinity in the Argentine Basin during 1980s as reported by Coles, McCartney, and Olson (J. Geophys. Res. 101, 1996, 8957-8970) is mostly the result of systematic errors in the data used for their analysis. Removing inconsistencies in a composite data set is also important for producing consistent climatological property fields even in the data abundant regions. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

For this purpose, images obtained in southwestern France by means of an S-band meteorological radar recorded every 5 min in 1996 were considered. The daily mean surfaces of AP appearing in these images are sorted into two states and their variations are then represented by a binary random variable. The Markov transition matrix, the 1-day-lag autocorrelation coefficient as well as the long-term probability of having each of both states are calculated on a monthly basis. The same kind of modeling was also applied to the rainfall observed in the radar dataset under study. The first-order two-state Markov chains are then found to fit the daily variations of either AP or rainfall areas very well. For each month of the year, the surfaces filled by both types of echo follow similar stochastic distributions, but their autocorrelation coefficient is different. Hence, it is suggested that this coefficient is a discriminant factor which could be used, among other criteria, to improve the identification of AP in radar images.

        "Absrtact": "We develop a probabilistic system for predicting the subcellular localization of proteins and estimating the relative population of the various compartments in yeast. Our system employs a Bayesian approach, updating a protein's probability of being in a compartment, based on a diverse range of 30 features. These range from specific motifs (e.g. signal sequences or the HDEL motif) to overall properties of a sequence (e.g. surface composition or isoelectric point) to whole-genome data (e.g. absolute mRNA expression levels or their fluctuations). The strength of our approach is the easy integration of many features, particularly the whole-genome expression data. We construct a training and testing set of ~1300 yeast proteins with an experimentally known localization from merging, filtering, and standardizing the annotation in the MIPS, Swiss-Prot and YPD databases, and we achieve 75% accuracy on individual protein predictions using this dataset. Moreover, we are able to estimate the relative protein population of the various compartments without requiring a definite localization for every protein. This approach, which is based on an analogy to formalism in quantum mechanics, gives better accuracy in determining relative compartment populations than that obtained by simply tallying the localization predictions for individual proteins (on the yeast proteins with known localization, 92% versus 74%). Our training and testing also highlights which of the 30 features are informative and which are redundant (19 being particularly useful). After developing our system, we apply it to the 4700 yeast proteins with currently unknown localization and estimate the relative population of the various compartments in the entire yeast genome. An unbiased prior is essential to this extrapolated estimate; for this, we use the MIPS localization catalogue, and adapt recent results on the localization of yeast proteins obtained by Snyder and colleagues using a minitransposon system. Our final localizations for all ~6000 proteins in the yeast genome are available over the web at: http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/genome/localize. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "The Filarial Genome Project (FGP) was initiated in 1994 under the auspices of the World Health Organisation. Brugia malayi was chosen as the model organism due to the availability of all life cycle stages for the construction of cDNA libraries. To date, over 20 000 cDNA clones have been partially sequenced and submitted to the EST database (dbEST). These ESTs define approximately 7000 new Brugia genes. Analysis of the EST dataset provides useful information on the expression pattern of the most abundantly expressed Brugia genes. Some highly expressed genes have been identified that are expressed in all stages of the parasite's life cycle, while other highly expressed genes appear to be stage-specific. To elucidate the structure of the Brugia genome and to provide a basis for comparison to the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, the FGP is also constructing a physical map of the Brugia chromosomes and is sequencing genomic BAC clones. In addition to the nuclear genome, B. malayi possesses two other genomes: the mitochondrial genome and the genome of a bacterial endosymbiont. Eighty percent of the mitochondrial genome of B. malayi has been sequenced and is being compared to mitochondrial sequences of other nematodes. The bacterial endosymbiont genome found in B. malayi is closely related to the Wolbachia group of rickettsia-like bacteria that infects many insect species. A set of overlapping BAC clones is being assembled to cover the entire bacterial genome. Currently, half of the bacterial genome has been assembled into four contigs. A consortium has been established to sequence the entire genome of the Brugia endosymbiont. The sequence and mapping data provided by the FGP is being utilised by the nematode research community to develop a better understanding of the biology of filarial parasites and to identify new vaccine candidates and drug targets to aid the elimination of human filariasis.

        "Absrtact": "A regional geochemical reconnaissance survey of the Cordillera Occidental of Ecuador was initiated in 1995 as a sub-component of a wider Mining Development and Environmental Control Technical Assistance Project (PRODEMINCA) in Ecuador. The 36,000 km2 survey area encompasses oceanic and continental-margin volcano-sedimentary terranes with known occurrences of porphyry-style Cu-Mo, exhalative massive sulphide, epithermal Au and mesothermal polymetallic mineralisation. A survey sample medium of < 177 \u03bcm stream sediments was selected following an orientation study in the vicinity of known porphyry Cu mineralisation. In the 2-4\u00b0S sector of the Cordillera Occidental for which data are presented, 4850 drainage samples were collected at an average density of 1 per 2.57 km2. All were analysed for 36 major and trace elements (Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mo, Ni, Co, Cd, Bi, As, Sb, Fe, Hg, Mn, Te, Ba, Cr, V, Sn, W, La, Al, Mg, Ca, Na, K, Sr, Y, Ga, Li, Nb, Sc, Ta, Ti, Zr). A stringent quality-control procedure included the systematic analysis of certified reference samples, field duplicates and replicates, data for which were used to calculate analytical precision, temporal drift and practical detection limits. Results for this part of the cordillera highlight the contrasting lithogeochemical signatures of the ocean-floor basalt terrane (Pallatanga Unit), the island-arc terrane of the Macuchi Unit, the continental volcanics of the Saraguro Group and the acid and intermediate lavas extruded from the Late Miocene to the Quaternary. Regional geochemical images for Au and associated pathfinder elements are dominated by anomalies relating to known mines and prospects. New exploration targets, often inconspicuous at the regional scale, have however been identified through the normalisation of data for individual lithological units against their respective geochemical backgrounds. In addition to mineral exploration, the drainage geochemical dataset for the Cordillera Occidental provides an unparalleled environmental baseline against which the impacts of future anthropogenic activities (including mining) may be assessed. A basis for the formulation of pragmatic sediment quality criteria and for the identification of natural geochemical hazards is also provided.",

The measurements were made over a pasture field in the south of England for 3 years, covering two dry years, 1995 and 1996 and a more normal year, 1997. The data show that, overall, approximately 80% of the measured net radiation was used for evaporation. During July and August of the two dry years, soil moisture deficits of over 150 mm developed within the top 1400 mm, and at these deficits the evaporation was reduced. During the summer months, overall between 71 and 76% of the net radiation was used for evaporation. During the winter months, the latent heat flux exceeded the net incoming radiation. An energy closure better than 10% suggests that the measurements were well founded. The surrounding trees may, however, have influenced the momentum exchange; the estimated roughness length of 38 mm is considerably more than the commonly accepted 10% of vegetation height. This extensive dataset provides an excellent test for the current UK Meteorological Office Surface Energy Scheme (MOSES) when applied to this site, the results of which are presented here. In its unoptimised form, the model can explain 72% of the variance of the hourly evaporative flux data, and with excellent agreement with the soil moisture measurements. Optimisation can improve the model fit, but only up to a maximum of 76%. The largest remaining errors occur during mid-summer when high temperatures, vapour pressure deficits and soil moisture deficits occur. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

The algorithm ameliorates partial volume and ringing artefacts, leaving unchanged local metabolic heterogeneity that is present in the original dataset but not evident at 1 H MRI. Therefore, it is ideally suited to metabolic studies of ischemia, infarction and other diseases where the extent of the abnormality at 1 H MRI is uncertain. The performance of the algorithm is assessed by simulations, MRI of phantoms, and by surface coil 23 Na MRI studies of canine myocardial infarction on a clinical scanner where the injury was not evident at 1 H MRI. The algorithm includes corrections for transverse field inhomogeneity, and for the leakage of intense signals into regions of interest such as 23 Na MRI signals from ventricular blood ringing into the myocardium. The simulations showed that the algorithm reduced ringing artefacts by 15%, was stable at low SNR (\u22437), but is sensitive to the positioning of the 1 H MRI boundaries. The 23 Na MRI showed hyperenhancement of regions identified as infarcted at post-mortem histological staining. The areas of hyperenhancement were measured by five independent observers in four 23 Na images of infarction reconstructed with and without the algorithm. The infarct areas were correlated with areas determined by post-mortem histological staining with coefficient 0.85 for the enhanced images, compared to 0.58 with the conventional images. The scatter in the amplitude and in the area measurements of ischemia-associated hyper- enhancement in 23 Na MRI was reduced by the algorithm by 1.6-fold and by at least 3-fold, respectively, demonstrating its ability to substantially improve quantification of the extent and intensity of metabolic changes in injured tissue that is not evident by 1 H MRI.

        "Absrtact": "Menon and Williams indicate that many United States (US) over-the-counter (OTC) firms which form audit committees appear not to rely on them (cf. Menon, K., Williams, J.D. 1994. Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 13(2), 121-139). Reliance on audit committees appears to depend upon board composition, while audit committee activity is associated with firm size. In this paper, we compare the US experience and evidence on audit committees and monitoring with the position in the United Kingdom (UK), where there has been a steady growth in the number of major companies voluntarily forming audit committees over the last 15 years (Collier, P.A. 1996. Accounting, Business and Financial History 6(2), 121-140). We contend that the dataset is best analyzed using the Heckman procedure (cf. Heckman, J.A. 1979. Econometrica 47(1), 153-161) which captures the two stages of the decision on audit committee activity. Our results show little support from the UK data for the findings of Menon and Williams (cf. Menon and Williams, 1994. Journal of Accounting and Public Policy 13(2), 121-139). However, consistent with their agency theoretic perspective of monitoring, we found that high quality (Big Six) auditors, and to some degree leverage have a positive relationship with audit committee activity. Contrary to an agency theoretic expectation, we found that audit committee activity is reduced in firms that combine the role of chairman and chief executive. On the basis of this result we explored the impact of insiders (executive directors) and found that their presence on an audit committee had a significant negative impact on audit committee activity. This result suggests that the emphasis placed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (Staff Report on Corporate Accountability, US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1980, p. 491) and the Cadbury Committee (Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance. 1992. Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance. Gee, London) on the independence of audit committee members may be well founded. The reduction in audit committee activity that arises from the combination of the role of chairman and chief executive officer, and the presence of insiders on the audit committee, has important policy implications. Indeed, in the UK, both practices are the subject of recommendations in the Hampel Committee report Hampel Committee 1998. Committee on Corporate Governance.

        "Absrtact": "Calculation of an 40Ar/39Ar age involves several sources of systematic (external) and statistic (mostly instrumental) errors that should be propagated into the final result for a proper statistical assessment of the age uncertainty and the overall resolution of the 40Ar/39Ar dating technique. Error propagation is usually carried out by linearized error expansion techniques that weight the relative variance contribution of each input parameter by the squared partial derivative of the age function relative to this variable. Computation of partial derivatives through the working 40Ar/39Ar equations is tedious and error-prone, however. As a result, several data reduction schemes using different levels of approximation are implemented in various laboratories, some of which ignore certain sources of error while others use simplified error equations, thus making direct comparison of published age and error estimates sometimes inaccurate. Based on the general numerical approach outlined by Roddick (1987) [Roddick, J.C., 1987. Generalized numerical error analysis with applications to geochronology and thermodynamics. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 51, 2129-2135], a complete 40Ar/39Ar numerical error analysis (NEA) is proposed that includes up to 28 possible sources of error. The NEA code of Roddick (1987) is recast into a more rigorous central finite-difference (CFD) scheme, and applied to three non-ideal, worked 40Ar/39Ar examples to test underpinning assumptions of the linearized error propagation by extending the error analysis to higher-order terms of the Taylor expansion of the age equation. Close to very close agreement between the analytic and numerical solutions suggests that the linearized error expansion technique is justified for 40Ar/39Ar error propagation, despite strong nonlinearity in the related equations. In one pathological instance, nonlinearity is flagged by significant (15%) departure from the algebraic solution. The linearized age error estimate is still found to be acceptably close to the (exact) NEA estimate, provided however that covariance between 40Ar(*) and 39Ar(K) is precisely accounted for. As most 40Ar/39Ar datasets will be invariably corrupted by large covariance corrections, a full-fledged error analysis as made possible through NEA is clearly desirable in most situations. The demonstrated flexibility of the numeric approach should be profitably extended to other areas of isotope geochemistry involving complex calculation codes such as treated here.",

        "Absrtact": "We investigated the seasonal variations of the mixed layer depth and temperature in the Kuroshio Extension region (145-180\u00b0E, 30-36\u00b0N), and studied the causes of the mixed layer depth and temperature 'regime shifts' which occurred in the late 1980s, using upper ocean thermal and heat flux datasets incorporated with a bulk mixed layer model. The mixed layer from fall to winter is cooled by the net surface heat flux, the Ekman transport and the entrainment, and warmed by the horizontal heat convergence resulting from the Kuroshio heat advection. The mixed layer depth is controlled by the entrainment and the horizontal transport divergence/convergence which act to slow the mixed layer deepening from fall to early winter and then in winter deepen the mixed layer. The entrainment velocity is significantly influenced by the temperature difference between the mixed layer and the layer below. The mixed layer shift from its deep to shallow phase occurred in 1985. This shift is preceded the SST-shift in 1988 by three years, and was caused by the horizontal transport divergence anomaly. The horizontal heat COnvergence of the Kuroshio Extension caused the SST-shift in 1988, whereas its anomaly had been already positive since 1983. The delay from 1983 to 1987 can be attributed to the effects of the negative fall-SST anomaly, stronger surface heat flux and Ekman cooling and the shoaling of the mixed layer depth. It is suggested that the Kuroshio current system plays a major role in forcing the SST-shift and thus the subsequent climate regime shift. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "A Geographic Information System (GIS), in concert with statistical and geostatistical software, has been used to compile, manipulate, analyze and visualize a large lithogeochemical dataset collected from the Archean age Swayze greenstone belt (SGB) located in northern Ontario, Canada. Altered samples from this database have been identified using a variety of univariate and multivariate statistical and visualization techniques. Alteration maps are produced for each method, and compared to known gold mineralization using the weights of evidence (WofE) technique. Major oxide data are interpolated using different sample groups (all, altered, unaltered, normalized samples), and anomalous concentrations are separated from background using breakpoints on probability plots of the data, as well as statistics generated from WofE analysis. These maps are also evaluated, using WofE analysis, with respect to locations of known gold prospects. The atypical normative mineral method is more sensitive for identifying alteration in felsic rocks (felsic volcanic rocks, granitoids), whereas the volatile method is more sensitive for detecting alteration in mafic volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks. Altered samples are characterized by higher SiO2, K2O and MnO concentrations, and lower MgO and TiO2 concentrations. Areas within the greenstone belt characterized by high concentrations of CaO, Fe, K2O and Al2O3 were found to the best predictors of the known gold prospects. Anomalously high concentrations of these oxides reflect carbonatization, Fe-carbonate alteration and potassic alteration trends, and indicate that these alteration styles are spatially related to gold mineralization. The WofE method is a useful technique with which to evaluate the geochemical maps produced in this paper. The WofE technique is useful not only for comparing geochemical anomalies to the location of known gold prospects, but also for providing a quantitative measure of association between anomalies and gold prospects. Furthermore, the gold potential maps generated using WofE not only highlight (or predict) known areas of gold mineralization, but also identify high potential areas where no known mineralization occurs. A number of areas within the SGB have been identified as having high gold potential on many of the geochemical maps produced in this paper. Many of these areas coincide with areas of known gold mineralization; however, others are enigmatic and await follow-up exploration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Ten absolute paleointensity determinations within the Brunhes chron have been obtained on andesitic lava flows from La Guadeloupe Island, French West Indies (F.W.I.). The Thellier and Thellier method performed on 124 specimens under either ambient or argon atmosphere allows reliable determinations from high temperature steps. A satisfactory within flow reproducibility has been observed and at least two samples for each flow have been used for calculation of the weighted-mean paleointensity. The average virtual axial dipole moment (VADM = 7.1 \u00b1 1.8 X 1022 A m2) for normal polarity flows from the Brunhes chron recorded at La Guadeloupe is compatible with the historical field. The 10 VADM values obtained show a relatively good agreement with the deep-sea composite record (SINT800) of relative paleointensity. Focusing on the 100-75 ka interval, a 20-ka oscillation observed from a compilation of available volcanic data and present in high-resolution sedimentary records has been tentatively related to the axial dipole moment variations. Finally, a paleointensity decrease of a factor of 10 is observed for flows emitted during the Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) transition, as already observed in other records of this reversal. Because a large area of the Globe around the Caribbean Islands was previously devoid of data, the present dataset fills a gap towards construction of a global paleointensity database for the Brunhes chron. \u0169 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The La Palma sediment wave field covers some 20,000 km2 of the continental slope and rise, and consists of sediment waves with wave heights of up to 70 m and wavelengths of up to 2.4 km. The wave crestlines have a complex morphology, with common bifurcation and a clear sinuosity. Waves have migrated upslope through time. Cores recovered from the wave field contain volcaniclastic turbidites interbedded with pelagic/hemipelagic layers. The wave field is interpreted as having formed beneath unconfined turbidity currents. A simple, previously published, two-layer model is applied to the waves, revealing that they formed beneath turbidity currents flowing at 10-100 cm/s-1, with a flow thickness of 60-400 m and a sediment concentration of 26-427 mg/l. The El Julan sediment wave field lies within a turbidity current channel on the southwest flank of El Hierro. The sediment waves display wave heights of about 6 m and wavelengths of up to 1.2 km. The waves are migrating upslope, and migration is most rapid in the centre of the channel where the flow velocity is highest. This wave field has been formed by channelised turbidity currents originating on the flanks of El Hierro. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In CF, entities are recommended to a new user based on the stated preferences of other, similar users. We describe a CF spider that collects from the Web lists of semantically related entities. These lists can then be used by existing CF algorithms by encoding them as 'pseudo-users'. Importantly, the spider can collect useful data without pre-programmed knowledge about the format of particular pages or particular sites. Instead, the CF spider uses commercial Web-search engines to find pages likely to contain lists in the domain of interest, and then applies previously proposed heuristics to extract lists from these pages. We show that data collected by this spider are nearly as effective for CF as data collected from real users, and more effective than data collected by two plausible hand-programmed spiders. In some cases, autonomously spidered data can also be combined with actual user data to improve performance.",

We generalize these methods, in particular, center-of-mass-prediction (COM-prediction) and local linear prediction (LL-prediction), to multivariate time series. The use of multivariate prediction techniques is especially interesting when time series are short but several variables have been measured simultaneously. These additional variables can sometimes supply information to perform good predictions that otherwise could only be obtained from longer time series. In contrast to non-local prediction methods, next neighbor techniques are applicable to non-stationary time series. This is particularly valuable for time series obtained under non-laboratory conditions, as in environmental science, where boundary conditions are not controllable. The application of our methods to the prediction of zooplankton data, collected in the German North Sea close to Helgoland island, turns out to be promising. \u00a9 2000 IMACS/Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "There are many ways to detect activation patterns in a time series of observations at a single voxel in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The critical problem is to estimate the statistical significance, which depends on the estimation of both the magnitude of the response to the stimulus and the serial dependence of the time series and especially on the assumptions made in that estimation. We show that for experimental designs with periodic stimuli, only a few aspects of the serial dependence are important and these can be estimated reliably via nonparametric estimation of the spectral density of the time series, whereas existing techniques are biased by their assumptions. The linear model with (stationary) serially dependent errors can be analyzed entirely in frequency domain, and doing so provides many insights. In particular, we introduce a technique to detect periodic activations and show that it has a distribution theory that enables us to assign significance levels down to 1 in 100,000, levels which are needed when a whole brain image is under consideration. Nonparametric spectral density estimation is shown to be self-calibrating and accurate when compared to several other time-domain approaches. The technique is especially resistant to high frequency artefacts that we have found in some datasets and we demonstrate that time-domain approaches may be sufficiently susceptible to these effects to give misleading results. The method is easily generalized to handle event-related designs. We found it necessary to consider the trends in the time series carefully and use nonlinear filters to remove the trends and robust techniques to remove 'spikes.' Using this in connection with our techniques allows us to detect activations in clumps of a few (even one) voxel in periodic designs, yet produce essentially no false positive detections at any voxels in null datasets.

This paper presents new techniques that accelerate splatting algorithms by exploiting both object-space and image-space coherence. In particular, we propose two visibility test methods suitable for octree-based splatting. The first method, based on dynamic image-space range trees, offers an accurate occlusion test and does not trade off image quality. The second method, based on image-space quadtrees, uses an approximate occlusion test that is faster than the first algorithm. Although the approximate visibility test may produce visual artifacts in rendering, the introduced error is usually not found very often. Tests with several datasets of useful sizes and complexities showed considerable speedups with respect to the splatting algorithm enhanced with octree only. Considering that they are very easy to implement, and need little additional memory, our techniques will be used as very effective splatting methods.",

These classes were based on Karnofsky performance status (KPS), primary tumor status, presence of extracranial system metastases, and age. An analysis of RTOG 91-04, a randomized study comparing two dose-fractionation schemes with a comparison to the established RTOG database, was considered important to validate the RPA classes.Methods and Materials: A total of 445 patients were randomized on RTOG 91-04, a Phase III study of accelerated hyperfractionation versus accelerated fractionation. No difference was observed between the two treatment arms with respect to survival. Four hundred thirty-two patients were included in this analysis. The majority of the patients were under age 65, had KPS 70-80, primary tumor controlled, and brain-only metastases. The initial RPA had three classes, but only patients in RPA Classes I and II were eligible for RTOG 91-04.Results: For RPA Class I, the median survival time was 6.2 months and 7.1 months for 91-04 and the database, respectively. The 1-year survival was 29% for 91-04 versus 32% for the database. There was no significant difference in the two survival distributions (p = 0.72). For RPA Class II, the median survival time was 3.8 months for 91-04 versus 4.2 months for the database. The 1-year survival was 12% and 16% for 91-04 and the database, respectively (p = 0.22).Conclusion: This analysis indicates that the RPA classes are valid and reliable for historical comparisons. Both the RTOG and other clinical trial organizers should currently utilize this RPA classification as a stratification factor for clinical trials. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

(C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.A nonlinear multiscale principal component analysis (NLMSPCA) methodology is proposed for process monitoring and fault detection based on multilevel wavelet decomposition and nonlinear principal component analysis via an input-training neural network. Performance monitoring charts with non-parametric control limits are applied to identify the occurrence of non-conforming operation prior to interrogating differential contribution plots to help identify the potential source of the fault.

        "Absrtact": "Web applications are becoming increasingly database-centric. Unfortunately, the support provided by most Web sites to explore such databases is rather primitive and is based on the traditional database metaphor of submitting an SQL query and packaging the response as an HTML page. Very often, the result set is empty or contains too many records. It is up to the user to refine the query by guessing how the query constraints must be tightened or relaxed and then go through another submit/response cycle. Furthermore, once results are displayed, typically no further exploration capabilities are offered. Web applications requiring interactive exploration of databases (e.g. e-commerce) need that the above submit/response metaphor be replaced with a continuous querying metaphor that seamlessly integrates querying with result browsing. In addition to supporting queries based on predicates on attribute values, queries based on example records should also be supported. We present techniques for supporting this metaphor and discuss their implementation in a Web-based database exploration engine.",

Multiple regression was used to determine factors associated with annual mortality risk. Analyses of variance were used for comparisons of mortality risks among parity and season groups. Average annual mortality risks during the 1997 period was 5.68%. Average breeding-female inventories and average lactation length on USA farms were 733 and 18.3 days, respectively. Higher annual breeding-female mortality risk was associated with larger herd size, greater parity at farrowing and shorter lactation length (P<0.02). For example, as herd size increases by 500 females, mortality risk increases by 0.44%. Older parity was associated with higher mortality risks. Summer season was also associated with higher mortality risk. Using five-years' records on 270 farms, annual mortality risk in 1997 was higher than those of 1993 and 1994, while average breeding-female inventory increased and lactation length decreased. It is recommended that producers, especially in large herds, pay more attention to breeding females. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Genetic and molecular research on hookworms is in its infancy, but several important genes and gene products have already been identified. Of note are cathepsin genes, a family of secreted proteins known as Ancylostoma activation-associated proteins and a family of anticoagulants. The inception of an expressed sequence tag program on the human hookworm, N. americanus, promises to yield many new genes with novel functions in the biology of these important parasites.

EVA is sensitive to 3-D structure, but has an advantage over field-based 3-D QSAR methods inasmuch as it is invariant to both translation and rotation of the structures concerned and thus structural superposition is not required. The latter property and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the descriptor for QSAR means that EVA has been the subject of a great deal of interest from the modelling community. This review describes the derivation of the descriptor, details its main parameters and how to apply them, and provides an overview of the validation that has been done with the descriptor. A recent enhancement to the technique is described which involves the localised adjustment of variance in such a way that enhanced internal and external predictability may be obtained. Despite the statistical quality of EVA QSAR models, the main draw-back to the descriptor at present is the difficulty associated with back-tracking from a PLS model to an EVA pharmacophore. Brief comment is made on the use of the EVA descriptor for diversity studies and the similarity searching of chemical structure databases. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.",

Current industry trends clearly show that incorporating ASR technology into existing or new wireless services as a replacement for touch-tone input is a natural progression in user interface. But is the current-generation ASR technology ready for prime time over wireless channels? Both qualitative and quantitative assessments for the core technology must be adopted by the industry before answering this question.

The Hollister Ridge is a major volcanic system located on the Western flank of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR), immediately south of the Eltanin Fracture Zones (FZs). We find or confirm two anomalous characteristics: the occurrence of seven normal faulting events on the transform segments, expressing extension across the plate boundary in the azimuth N26\u00b0W, and more than 90% deficiency in the seismic moment released during strike-slip events on the transforms, as compared to the rate expected from kinematic models. Other seismic properties are typical of the seismicity of a fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge (MOR) system. In particular, we could not document a single teleseismically recorded event on the Hollister Ridge; earthquakes are confined to narrow TFs with no activity present on the ridge segments. The transform events have regular frequency-moment statistics, and we could not document any significantly slow sources. These seismic properties generally support conventional plate tectonics models such as NUVEL-1, and cannot be reconciled with a proposed reorientation of the Pacific plate 4 Ma ago.

The cell density of total nannoplankton decreased significantly in some nearshore stations along the Western Australian coast where the Leeuwin Current flows. A total of 92 taxa were identified by SEM observation from 118 of the samples, i.e. those which had common nannoplankton and allowed the distinction between upper- and lower-photic zone floras. The most abundant taxa were classified into three main groups and two independent species based on their distribution pattern. Of the latter, Umbellosphaera irregularis is common in the shallower samples in the tropics, whilst Gephyrocapsa oceanica occurs in isolated patches. Group U taxa (Discosphaera tubifera, Rhabdosphaera clavigera var. stylifera and Umbellosphaera tenuis) occur in the shallower depths of the subtropical water. Group UL taxa, which include Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericasonii, Syracosphaera spp., Umbilicosphaera hulburtiana and various other taxa whose coccospheres are covered by holococcoliths (holococcolithophores), are common in the subtropics. Group L taxa, which are composed of Florisphaera profunda. Oolithotus antillarum, Gladiolithus flabellatus and Algirosphaera oryza, are most common in the deep water. In order to clarify the mega-trends of floral variations in the upper- and lower-photic zone communities, we obtained the following two rations. The ratio of U. irregularis to groups U + UL in the upper-photic community is positively related to temperature, whereas its relationship with salinity and water density is negative. In the lower-photic community, the ratio of group L to UL varies in the nutrient-poor environments, but is consistently high in eutrophic environments. The occurrence of G. oceanica is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity and lower water density in the upper-photic community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Lesions in estuarine finfish are associated with a variety of organisms including parasites and bacterial, viral, and fungal infectious agents. In addition, trauma, suboptimal water quality, and other abiotic stress factors may result in the loss of homeostasis. We have observed solitary ulcerative lesions on menhaden sampled from the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, the Pamlico River, North Carolina, and the St. Johns River, Florida. Histologically, the lesions demonstrated a marked chronic inflammatory infiltrate and granulomas in response to fungal hyphae throughout large areas of exposed necrotic muscle. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria were also observed in the lesions, a common finding in ulcers of aquatic organisms. Similar observations in menhaden and other species have been described previously in the literature as ulcerative mycosis, mycotic granulomatosis, red spot disease, and epizootic ulcerative syndrome. Despite the many different known causes of fish lesions, the popular press and the scientific literature have recently emphasized Pfiesteria piscicida and other Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates (and their bioactive compounds) as the primary causative agent for finfish lesions, particularly mycotic granulomatous ulcers in Atlantic menhaden. While some laboratory data suggest that Pfiesteria may play a role in field-observed lesions, much more cause-and-effect evidence is needed to determine the importance of other risk factors, both alone or and in combination with Pfiesteria. In order to better understand the etiology of lesion initiation and progression in estuarine finfish, accurate assessments of environmental conditions collected on appropriate temporal and spatial scales, and fish morphological indicators consistent with gross and histological pathologic terminology, should be used for reporting fish lesion observations and kills. Further, this outlook will help to avoid bias and may foster a broader perspective for examining the health of estuarine systems in general. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "The Archaean rocks of the Yilgarn Craton comprise the largest geological entity in Western Australia and one of the largest areas of Archaean crust anywhere in the world. However, poor outcrop has prevented a thorough understanding of the structure of the crust in the region, a subject of particular interest being the relationship between high-grade metamorphic rocks in the west, and lower-grade granitoid-greenstone terrains further east. Interpretation of previously unpublished seismic refraction data, combined with the re-interpretation of published data, allows crustal velocity structure in the southwest of the Craton to be resolved. Overall, the structure is similar to shield areas elsewhere in the world, the data defining a two-layered crust with an average thickness of about 35 km. However, significant lateral variations in velocity structure are also observed, and these coincide with a terrane boundary previously postulated on the basis of geological observations and seismic reflection data. The terrane boundary dips to the east, extends through the entire crust, and is notable for an area of anomalously high seismic velocity in the lower crust. Two possible interpretations of the high-velocity zone are proposed. Firstly, it is due to the presence of mafic to ultramafic intrusions. Secondly, and the preferred interpretation, the high-velocity zone is a fault-bounded mega-sliver, which may be a suspect terrane in its own right, perhaps with oceanic affinities. The results of the seismic experiment strongly support tectonic models for Yilgarn Craton based on terrane tectonics. The possibility that the terrane boundary is being reactivated by contemporary stresses also provides a plausible explanation for the local intra-plate seismicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Seafloor lithologies are classified into extrusives, basaltic talus, dykes, gabbros and serpentinites, and the dive locations are broadly classified according to whether they are close to transform valleys and as a function of ridge spreading rate. The database is used to determine whether there is any difference in the maximum slope for each rock type, which might relate to differences in rock jointing, cohesion or friction properties. There is a common perception that lower crustal rocks form steeper slopes than shallower crustal rocks but until now there has been little evidence to support or refute this idea. From our analysis we find a tendency for gabbro and dykes to form steeper slopes than serpentinite. The 90th percentile of each lithology slope distribution, used as a measure of limiting slope, is 43\u00b0, 39\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 for gabbro, dykes and serpentinite, respectively. Lithologic control on slope is weak, however, compared to overall slope variability in these mid-ocean ridge settings so seafloor relief is likely to be a poor guide to underlying geology. We speculate on the structure of eroding fault scarps, outline the implications for attempts to infer active faults from talus ramp activity and discuss more generally factors affecting the geomorphology of mid-ocean ridge slopes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A method has been developed to weight the contribution of each element (1920 kernels) in the representation according to its power of predicting similarity of faces. The same statistical method has also been used to assess how changes in orientation (horizontal and vertical), expression, illumination and background contribute to the overall variance in the kernel activations. It was shown on a Caucasian and a Japanese image-set that weighting the elements in the representation according to their discriminative power would increase recognition performance. It has also been demonstrated that the weighting method is particularly useful when data compression is a key requirement. The advantages of the weighting scheme were also verified by double cross-validation.",

        "Absrtact": "It is observed that during divergent evolution of two proteins with a common phylogenetic origin, the structural similarity of their backbones is often preserved even when the sequence similarity between them decreases to a virtually undetectable level. Here we analyzed, whether the conservation of structure along evolution involves also the local atomic structures in the interfaces between secondary structural elements. We have used as study case one protein family, the proteasomal subunits, for which 17 crystal structures are known. These include 14 different subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 2 subunits of Thermoplasma acidophilum and one subunit of Escherichia coli. The structural core of the 17 proteasomal subunits has 23 secondary structural elements. Any two adjacent secondary structural elements form a molecular interface consisting of two molecular patches. We found 61 interfaces that occurred in all 17 subunits. The 3D shape of equivalent molecular patches from different proteasomal subunits were compared by superposition. Our results demonstrate that pairs of equivalent molecular patches show an RMSD which is lower than that of randomly chosen patches from unrelated proteins. This is true even when patch comparisons with identical residues were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore it is known that the sequential dissimilarity is correlated to the RMSD between the backbones of the members of protein families. The question arises whether this is also true for local atomic structures. The results show that the correlation of individual patch RMSD values and local sequence dissimilarities is low and has a wide range from 0 to 0.41, however, it is surprising that there is a good correlation between the average RMSD of all corresponding patches and the global sequence dissimilarity. This average patch RMSD correlates slightly stronger than the C(\u03b1)-trace RMSD to the global sequence dissimilarity. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

The standard method of data analysis involves the least-squares inversion of the data with respect to various user-chosen model parameters (such as the geometry or density of the lithology). One serious problem with most inversion schemes is that they are liable to converge to local minima - that is they reach a set of model parameters whose geophysical response is a better fit to the observed data than the starting model, but they do not reach the set of parameters that would provide the best fit possible. The set of initial model parameters that converge to a particular minima of the misfit surface is studied here for some magnetic models, and is found to be a fractal when there are two minima available for the model to converge to, and at least two model parameters are inverted. The fractal dimension of the set is shown to be inversely proportional to the damping of the inversion process.",

The uniqueness of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (CLIP, 92-74 Ma) with respect to other Cretaceous oceanic plateaus is its extensive sub-aerial exposures, providing an excellent basis to investigate the temporal and compositional relationships within a starting plume head. We present major element, trace element and initial Sr-Nd-Pb isotope composition of 40 extrusive rocks from the Caribbean Plateau, including onland sections in Costa Rica, Colombia and Curacao as well as DSDP Sites in the Central Caribbean. Even though the lavas were erupted over an area of ~3 X 106 km2, the majority have strikingly uniform incompatible element patterns (La/Yb = 0.96 \u00b1 0.16, n = 64 out of 79 samples, 2\u03c3) and initial Nd-Pb isotopic compositions (e.g. 143Nd/144Nd(in) = 0.51291 \u00b1 3, \u03b5(Ndi) = 7.3 \u00b1 0.6, 206Pb/204Pb(in) = 18.86 \u00b1 0.12, n = 54 out of 66, 2\u03c3). Lavas with endmember compositions have only been sampled at the DSDP Sites, Gorgona Island (Colombia) and the 65-60 Ma accreted Quepos and Osa igneous complexes (Costa Rica) of the subsequent hotspot track. Despite the relatively uniform composition of most lavas, linear correlations exist between isotope ratios and between isotope and highly incompatible trace element ratios. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotope and trace element signatures of the chemically enriched lavas are compatible with derivation from recycled oceanic crust, while the depleted lavas are derived from a highly residual source. This source could represent either oceanic lithospheric mantle left after ocean crust formation or gabbros with interlayered ultramafic cumulates of the lower oceanic crust. High 3He/4He in olivines of enriched picrites at Quepos are ~ 12 times higher than the atmospheric ratio suggesting that the enriched component may have once resided in the lower mantle. Evaluation of the Sm-Nd and U-Pb isotope systematics on isochron diagrams suggests that the age of separation of enriched and depleted components from the depleted MORB source mantle could have been \u2264 500 Ma before CLIP formation and interpreted to reflect the recycling time of the CLIP source. Mantle plume heads may provide a mechanism for transporting large volumes of possibly young recycled oceanic lithosphere residing in the lower mantle back into the shallow MORB source mantle.",

The study shows that the conventional sequence stratigraphy concept works well in the South Caspian Basin. Clinoform complexes within Paleo-Amudarya shelf margin are bounded by regionally, seismically expressed sequence boundaries and flooding surfaces that can be traced to the deep basin. Sequence analysis and seismic facies interpretation showed that deposition of prograding clinoforms and deep-water turbidite systems were controlled by the relative lake-level change. Depositional interpretation of sediment infill indicates that in the South Caspian Basin, as in other closed basins with high terrigineous input, basinal deposition is from turbidity currents and slumps generated from large shelf-edge deltas. There are two distinct stratigraphic complexes interpreted from seismic data: lower, interpreted as homogeneous infill of mud-rich turbidites and deepwater lacustrine deposits (Upper Pliocene, i.e. Akchagyl and Aspheron), and upper, consisting of prograding clinoform packages and coeval deepwater fan systems and slumps (Quaternary). The source of the central basin turbidite infill was primarily the eastern \"Paleo-Amudarya\" shelf. Growing diapir folds structurally controlled deposition of large-scale fan systems in the central basin. The distribution of these fan systems is tied to location of the coeval thick shelf-margin complexes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "We develop a simple, analytical model for canopy resistance to canopy-atmosphere gas exchange that is well suited for incorporation into regional-scale land-surface parameterizations. This model exploits the conservative nature of canopy light-use efficiency (LUE) in carbon assimilation that is observed within broad categories of plant species. The model paradigm assumes that under standard environmental conditions, a canopy will operate at the field-measured LUE, but will deviate from this standard efficiency as conditions change. Effective LUE estimates generated by the model respond to variations in atmospheric humidity, CO2 concentration, the composition of solar irradiation (direct versus diffuse beam fractions), and soil moisture content. This modeling approach differs from scaled-leaf parameterizations in that a single estimate of nominal canopy LUE replaces both a detailed mechanistic description of leaf-level photosynthetic processes and the scaling of these processes from the leaf to canopy level. This results in a model that can be evaluated analytically, and is thus computationally efficient and requires few species-specific parameters. Both qualities lend themselves well to regional-and global-scale modelling efforts. For purposes of testing, this canopy resistance submodel has been embedded in the Atmosphere-Land Exchange (ALEX) surface energy balance model. The integrated model generates transpiration and carbon assimilation fluxes that compare well with estimates from iterative mechanistic photosynthetic models, and with flux measurements made in stands of corn, soybean, prairie grasses, desert shrubs, rangeland, and black spruce. Comparisons between modeled and measured evapotranspiration (LE) and carbon assimilation (A(c)) fluxes yield mean-absolute-percent-differences of 24% (LE) and 33% (A(c)) for hourly daytime fluxes, and 12% (LE) and 18% (A(c)) for daily-integrated fluxes. These comparisons demonstrate robustness over a variety of vegetative and climatic regimes, suggesting that this simple analytical model of canopy resistance will be useful in regional-scale flux evaluations.

The first averaging process is to find the individual predictions of features by using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The second averaging process combines the predictions of all features. During the first averaging step, each feature is associated with a weight in order to determine the prediction ability of the feature at the local query point. The weights, found for each local query point, are used in the second prediction step and enforce the method to have an adaptive or context-sensitive nature.

        "Absrtact": "Onchocerca volvulus, the filarial parasite that causes onchocerciasis or river blindness, contains three distinct genomes. These include the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome and the genome of an intracellular endosymbiont of the genus Wolbachia. The nuclear genome is roughly 1.5x108bp in size, and is arranged on four chromosome pairs. Analysis of expressed sequence tags from different life-cycle stages has resulted in the identification of transcripts from roughly 4000 O. volvulus genes. Several of these transcripts are highly abundant, including those encoding collagen and cuticular proteins. Analysis of several gene sequences from O. volvulus suggests that the nuclear genes of O. volvulus are relatively compact and are interrupted relatively frequently by small introns. The intron-exon boundaries of these genes generally follow the GU-AG rule characteristic of the splice donor and acceptors of other vertebrate organisms. The nuclear genome also contains at least one repeated sequence family of a 150bp repeat which is arranged in tandem arrays and appears subject to concerted evolution. The mitochondrial genome of O. volvulus is remarkably compact, only 13 747bp in size. Consistent with the small size of the genome, four gene pairs overlap, eight contain no intergenic regions and the remaining gene pairs are separated by small intergenic domains ranging from 1 to 46bp. The protein-coding genes of the O. volvulus mitochondrial genome exhibit a striking codon bias, with 15/20 amino acids having a single codon preference greater than 70%.Intraspecific variation in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes appears to be quite limited, consistent with the hypothesis that O. volvulus has suffered a genetic bottleneck in the recent past.

Aiming at a better understanding, as well as predictions of spatial and temporal leaf adjustments, a recently proposed dynamic optimality approach is adapted to a set of relevant leaf variables. The underlying formalism explicitly includes the adaptive dynamics of an arbitrary growth controlling trait. The approach is based on the calculation of growth gradients, and hence requires functional growth dependencies on the traits as well as on the different environmental conditions within a crown. These dependencies are quantified using a standard photosynthesis model (PGEN). It is found that the simple gradient approach fails in describing patterns originating from leaf senescence. To include aging phenomena the model is completed by a simple evolution equation which is applicable for a wide range of species. Simulation results of the combined model for shaded and for sunlit reaves are compared to an existing dataset for beech phenology collected during 3 years at the Solling site in central Germany.

By using the HBV-N model in southern Sweden (145 000 km2) daily nitrogen leaching, reduction in rivers and lakes, net transport to the sea and source apportionment have been calculated in 3725 subbasins for the period 1985-1994, with calibration at 722 sites against measured time series. On average, 48% of the nonpoint losses from agriculture were reduced during the transport towards the sea, which left about 33 500 tonnes in annual mean net transport. This represents 45% of the total land-based load. Land cover and emissions for the years of 1985 and 1994 were used in two separate simulations of the 10-year period. The normalized gross leakage from arable land in 1985 was estimated to 29 kg N ha-1 year-1, which corresponds to 15 kg N ha-1 year-1 in net leakage to the sea. In 1994 these transports were reduced by 20 and 15%, and thereby the total load on the sea was decreased by 7%. This is still far from the Swedish goal of 50% reduction. The article presents the spatial variation of nitrogen leakage and retention within the southern half of Sweden, and emphasizes the importance of allocating measures where down-stream retention is low in order to achieve efficiency with respect to the sea. It is shown that the model approach may be used in the decision making process for best management practices in watersheds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Its light curve displays significant variation while the entire data appears to be consistent with a simple decay represented by t -1.4 considering together the flux given by the PCA/RXTE scan at an earlier period.

        "Absrtact": "The Western Gneiss Region (WGR) marks the outcrop of a composite terrane consisting of variably re-worked Proterozoic basement and parautochthonous or autochthonous cover units. The WGR exhibits a gross structural, petrographic and thermobarometric zonation from southeast to northwest, reflecting an increasing intensity of Scandian (late Palaeozoic) metamorphic and structural imprint. Scandian-aged eclogites have been widely (though for kinetic reasons not invariably) stabilised in metabasic rocks but have suffered varying degrees of retrogression during exhumation. In the region between the Jostedal mountains and Nordjord, eclogites commonly have distinctively prograde-zoned garnets with amphibolite or epidote-amphibolite facies solid inclusions suites and lack any evidence for stability of coesite (high pressure [HP] eclogites). In the south of this area, in Sunnfjord, eclogites locally contain glaucophane as an inclusion or matrix phase. North of Nordfjord, eclogites mostly lack prograde zoning and evidence for coesite, either as relics as relics or replacive polycrystalline quartz, is present in both eclogites (ultrahigh pressure [UHP] eclogites) and, rarely, gneisses. Coesite or polycrystalline quartz after coesite has now been found in eight new localities, including one close to a microdiamond-bearing gneiss. These new discoveries suggest that, by a conservative estimate, the UHP terrane, in the WGR covers a coastal strip of about 5000 km2 between outer Nordfjord and Moldefjord. A 'mixed HP/UHP zone' containing both HP and UHP eclogites is confirmed by our observations, and is extended a further 40 km east along Nordfjord. Thermobarometry on phengite-bearing eclogites has been used to quantify the regional distribution of pressure (P) and temperature (T) across the WGR. Overall, a scenario emerges where P and T progressively increase from 500\u00b0C and 16 kbar in Sunnfjord to > 800\u00b0C and 32 kbar in outer Moldefjord, respectively, in line with the distribution of eclogite petrographic features. Results are usually consistent with the silica polymorph present or inferred. The P-T conditions define a linear array in the P-T plane with a slope of roughly 5\u00b0C/km, with averages for petrographic groups lying along the trend according to their geographic distribution from SE to NW, hence defining a clear field gradient. This P-T gradient might be used to support the frequently postulated model for northwesterly subduction of the WGC as a coherent body. However, the WGC is clearly a composite edifice built from several tectonic units. Furthermore, the mixed HP/UHP zone seems to mark a step in the regional P gradient, indicating a possible tectonic break and tectonic juxtaposition of the HP and UHP units. Lack of other clear evidence for a tectonic break in the mixed zone dicatates caution in this interpretation, and we cannot discount the possibility that the mixed zone is, at least, partly a result of kinetic operating near the HP-UHP transition. Overall, if the WGC has been subducted during the Scandian orogeny, it has retained its general fown-slab pattern of P and T in spite of any disruption during exhumation. Garnetiferous peridotites derived from subcontinental lithospheric mantle may be restricted to the UHP terrane and appear to decorate basement-cover contacts in many cases. P-T conditions calculated from previously published data for both relict (Proterozoic lithospheric mantle?) porphyroclast assemblages and Scandian (subduction-related?) neoblastic assemblages do not define such a clear field gradient, but probably record a combination of their pre-orogenic P-T record with Scandian re-working during and after subduction entrainment. A crude linear array in the P-T plane defined by peridotite samples may be, in part, an artifact of errors in the geobarometric methods. A spatial association of mantle-derived peridotites with the UHP terrane and with basement-cover contacts is consistent with a hypothesis for entrainment of at least some of them as 'foreign' fragments into a crustal UHP terrane during subduction of the Baltic continental margin to depths of > 100 km, and encourages a more mobilistic view of the assembly of the WGC from its component lithotectonic elements.

In subsequent BPA and di-n-butyl phthalate studies, large intralitter variability of this specific end point was apparent when the VP weights from entire litter complements were examined. We modeled the effects of sampling 1, 2, or 3 pups from each litter using the full-litter complement data. When one pup was randomly selected, a substantial percentage of incorrect conclusions about the presence or absence of treatment effects occurred. These statistical modeling analyses raise significant concern about the selection of one pup per litter for highly variable end points. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

        "Absrtact": "It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976-77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10-15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965-1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone. \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Flood basalts make up 85% of the archipelago and are interpreted as the most recent volcanism ( < 40 Ma) from the Kerguelen hotspot which has erupted basalt for the last 115 million years. Based on 40AR/39Ar incremental heating of acid-leached groundmass separates, we report isochron ages ranging from 29.26 \u00b1 0.87 Ma to 24.53 \u00b1 0.29 Ma for 15 basalts from five stratigraphic sections from diverse regions of the archipelago. The oldest dated basalt from the archipelago (~ 29 Ma) is much younger than the ~ 40 Ma age of conjunction between the hotspot and the Southeast Indian Ridge. Basalt eruption seems to have ceased shortly after ~ 24 Ma although small volume, highly evolved lavas and plutons continued to form in the archipelago. The basalt age data suggest an average lava accumulation rate of ~ 1.6\u00b10.9 km/my during the Oligocene. The archipelago's volumetric eruption rate (0.009 km3/yr) is lower than estimates made for the Cretaceous Kerguelen Plateau (1.7 km3/yr) and the Ninetyeast Ridge hotspot track (0.18 km3/yr), suggesting that the late Cenozoic extrusive activity of the Kerguelen plume is waning. Cenozoic volcanism attributed to the Kerguelen plume occurs over a diffuse area with Quaternary eruptions at Heard and McDonald Islands and within the Kerguelen Archipelago. The decreasing eruption rate and areally diffuse volcanism may be explained by the thick lithosphere of the Cretaceous Kerguelen Plateau overriding and insulating the plume. However, if the undated NKP, which underlies the archipelago, formed during the Cenozoic, then, the crustal production rate of the plume from 40 Ma to the present (~ 0.25 km3/yr) would be similar to the crustal production rate (0.23 km3/my) previously estimated for the formation of the Ninetyeast Ridge (~ 82-38 Ma).",

        "Absrtact": "OBJECTIVE: We tested whether a common AMPD1 gene variant is associated with improved cardiovascular (CV) survival in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). BACKGROUND: Reduced activity our adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) may increase production of adenosine, a cardioprotective agent. A common, nonsense, point variant of the AMPD1 gene (C34T) results in enzymatic inactivity and has been associated with prolonged survival in heart failure. METHODS: Blood was collected from 367 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme digestion, resulting in allele-specific fiagments. Coronary artery disease was defined as \u226570% stenosis of \u22651 coronary artery. Patients were followed prospectively for up to 4.8 years. Survival statistics compared hetero- (+/-) or homozygotic (-/-) carriers with noncarriers. RESULTS: Patients were 66 \u00b1 10 years old; 79% were men; 22.6% were heterozygous and 1.9% homozygous for the variant AMPD1(-) allele. During a mean of 3.5 \u00b1 1.0 years, 52 patients (14.2%) died, 37 (10.1%) of CV causes. Cardiovascular mortality was 4.4% (4/90) in AMPD1(-) allele carriers compared with 11.9% (33/277) in noncarriers (p = 0.046). In multiple variable regression analysis, only age (hazard ratio, 1.11/year, p < 0.001) and AMPD1(-) carnage (hazard ratio, 0.36, p = 0.053) were independent predictors of CV mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Carriage of a common variant of the AMPD1 gene was associated with improved CV survival in patients with angiographically documented CAD. The dysfunctional AMPD1(-) allele may lead to increased cardiac adenosine and increased cardioprotection during ischemic events. Adenosine monophosphate deaminase-1 genotyping should be further explored in CAD for prognostic, mechanistic and therapeutic insights. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.",

During this period, the volcano exhibited a pattern of cyclic inflation and deflation with an 8-14 h period. We find that SO2 emission rates, measured by COSPEC, correlate with the amplitude of these tilt cycles, and that higher rates of SO2 emission were associated with stronger ground deformation and enhanced hybrid seismicity. Within tilt cycles, degassing peaks coincide with maximum deformation gradients. Increases in the amount of gas in the magma conduit feeding the dome, probably due to increases in volatile content of ascending magma volume can account for the observed increases in tilt amplitude, hybrid seismicity and SO2 emission rate.

Previous studies of the Brazil-Falkland Current confluence have concentrated on the formation of eddies south of 35\u00b0S. However, in situ measurements and TOPEX/POSEIDON imagery of the region reveal eddies developing as far north as 32\u00b0S. These features are not evident in the coincident AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) imagery. In this study, the origin of the eddies identified are discussed with reference to the contemporary in situ measurements of temperature and salinity. Using the combination of satellite imagery and in situ data, it can be determined that the surface waters of the eddies north of 36\u00b0S are influenced by water from an estuarine source. TOPEX imagery enables the movements and variability of the regions water masses: estuarine outflow, Falkland and Brazil currents, to be monitored synoptically. The combination of satellite imagery and the higher resolution of in situ AMT measurements enables these water masses to be better identified. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

We discuss how such a source would contribute to the magnitude and directional properties of the observed flux when measured against a background of extragalactic cosmic rays. We do this using the results of previous propagation calculations and our own more recent calculations which are specifically for a Galactic Center source. We find that the AGASA data can indeed be plausibly interpreted in this way and also that an argument can be made that the Galactic Center has the appropriate physical properties for acceleration to energies of the order of 1018 eV. We show that data from the SUGAR array are compatible with the AGASA result. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "In April and May 1996, a geophysical study of the Cascadia continental margin off Oregon and Washington was carried out aboard the German RV Sonne as a cooperative experiment between GEOMAR, the USGS and COAS. Offshore central Oregon, which is the subject of this study, the experiment involved the collection of wide-angle refraction and reflection data along three profiles across the continental margin using ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and hydrophones (OBH) as well as land recorders. Two-dimensional modelling of the travel times provides a detailed velocity structure beneath these profiles. The subducting oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca plate can be traced from the trench to its position some 10 km landward of the coastline. At the coastline, the Moho has a depth of 30 km. The dip of the plate changes from 1.5\u00b0 westward of the trench to about 6.5\u00b0 below the accretionary complex and to about 16\u00b0 further eastward below the coast. The backstop forming western edge of the Siletz terrane, an oceanic plateau that was accreted to North America about 50 Ma ago, is well defined by the observations. It is located about 60 km to the east of the deformation front and has a seaward dip of 40\u00b0. At its seaward edge, the base of the Siletz terrane seems to be in contact with the subducting oceanic crust implying that sediments are unlikely to be subducted to greater depths. The upper oceanic crust is thinner to the east of this contact than to the west. At depths greater than 18 km, the top of the oceanic crust is the origin of pre-critical reflections observable in several land recordings and in the data of one ocean bottom instrument. These reflections are most likely caused by fluids that are released from the oceanic crust by metamorphic facies transition. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Unfortunately, the computing environment within which such systems are deployed is radically different from the environments in which decision procedures are most easily designed. We summarize experience in reconciling these differences, using a general architecture but working in a specific domain (forest management). This required us to reconcile the constraints of the mobile computing device (limited resources, small touch-screen, support for procedural programming languages only) with the ability to rapidly select and configure different decision procedures for deployment in differing management conditions. We managed to reconcile these conflicting demands by taking advantage of the restricted forms of inference needed in the domain, making it possible to combine declarative and procedural aspects of the problem in a reliable way.",

The legume lectins form a large family of homologous proteins that exhibit a wide variety of carbohydrate specificities. The legume lectin family is therefore highly suitable as a model system to study the structural principles of protein-carbohydrate recognition. Until now, structural data are only available for two specificity families: Man/Glc and Gal/GalNAc. No structural data are available for any of the fucose or chitobiose specific lectins. The crystal structure of Ulex europaeus (UEA-II) is the first of a legume lectin belonging to the chitobiose specificity group. The complexes with N-acetylglucosamine, galactose and fucosylgalactose show a promiscuous primary binding site capable of accommodating both N-acetylglucos amine or galactose in the primary binding site. The hydrogen bonding network in these complexes can be considered suboptimal, in agreement with the low affinities of these sugars. In the complexes with chitobiose, lactose and fucosyllactose this suboptimal hydrogen bonding network is compensated by extensive hydrophobic interactions in a Glc/GlcNAc binding subsite. UEA-II thus forms the first example of a legume lectin with a promiscuous binding site and illustrates the importance of hydrophobic interactions in protein-carbohydrate complexes. Together with other known legume lectin crystal structures, it shows how different specificities can be grafted upon a conserved structural framework. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

A complex system of northwest-southeast rifts was active contemporaneously with an east-west trending rift. This rift activity led to northward separation of the Falkland Plateau, and formation of the Weddell Sea by sea floor spreading. Atypically, the Jurassic passive margin of Gondwana shows evidence for coeval extension in two directions and a large volume of interpreted magmatic material. This is consistent with initial doming above a mantle plume and we suggest that this resulted in the formation of a triple junction. Magnetic anomalies indicate a series of faults perpendicular to igneous intrusions and extrusions with outlines that range in shape from lozenges to parallel ridges. They show remarkably good spatial correlation with free air gravity anomalies, even in areas of sea ice. We base a structural elements map and timing sequence for the events in the WSE during early Gondwana breakup on anomaly cross-cutting relationships. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "The crystal-liquid partition coefficients for Sr and Cr, D(Sr) and D(Cr), have been determined from electron microprobe analyses of plagioclase-liquid and orthopyroxene-liquid pairs produced in melting experiments run at pressures from 1 bar to 27 kbar on two compositions relevant to anorthosite petrogenesis. One is a primitive jotunite (hypersthene monzodiorite: TJ); the other is a sample of an anorthositic dyke (500B). Results indicate that D(Sr) (plag/liq) remains nearly constant with increasing pressure (TJ: 1.7 to 2.6; 500B: 0.9 to 1.4). This modest variation apparently results from the combined and opposing effects of crystal chemistry and pressure: D(Sr) increases with the albite content of plagioclase, which itself increases with pressure along a composition's liquidus, so pressure must have an intrinsic negative effect. The two models for D(Sr) [J. Blundy, B. Wood, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 55 (1991) 193-209; I. Bindeman, A. Davis, M. Drake, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 62 (1998) 1175-1193] that take into account the strong correlation between D(Sr) and plagioclase composition overestimate D(Sr) at high pressure; whereas the two models that ignore plagioclase composition [S. Morse, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 56 (1992) 1735-1738; R. Nielsen, Comput. Geosci. 18 (1992) 773-788] underestimate it. Moreover, since none of these models takes into account any pressure effect, the discrepancies between predicted and observed D(Sr) increase with pressure for all models. The new results also show that D(Cr) (opx/liq) increases significantly with pressure: D(Cr) = 2 at 1 atm and 14.2 at 10 kbar. These new data confirm earlier, less precise determinations of D(Cr) that were used to infer a high-pressure origin for Al- and Cr-rich orthopyroxene megacrysts. The calculated Sr and Cr concentrations of liquids in equilibrium at 10 kbar with plagioclase and orthopyroxene megacrysts from anorthosite massifs (Sr = 370 to 610 ppm and Cr = 20 to 130 ppm) are in the range of what is observed in high-Al gabbros and primitive jotunites, the inferred parent magmas of massive anorthosites.

These new data document four periods of kimberlite magmatism previously unrecognized in eastern North America: at 196, 180-176, 148-146 and 142-134 Ma. In addition, the detailed emplacement history of Jurassic kimberlites in the Kirkland Lake field indicates magmatism spanned a period of 13 Myr from 165 to 152 Ma with approximately half of the kimberlites in this field emplaced in less than 2 Myr between 156.9-155.3 Ma. These U-Pb results demonstrate for the first time that there is a NW-SE Triassic to Cretaceous age progression in kimberlite magmatism, which is consistent with the relative plate motions of North America during this interval. This age progression in kimberlite magmatism extends for more than 2000 km from Rankin Inlet through to the Attawapiskat, Kirkland Lake and Timiskaming fields and is interpreted, in part, to be the continental expression of magmatism linked to the Great Meteor mantle plume hotspot track. If correct, then the timing and location of this magmatism provides a more rigid constraint for both the exact position of the hotspot and the relative direction and rate of North American plate motion during the Mesozoic opening of the North Atlantic Ocean.

Method: Detailed survey and administrative data were collected on 480 children who entered long-term foster care in San Diego County from May 1990 through October 1991. These data were linked with claims data from Medicaid and San Diego County Mental Health Services information systems. A Poisson regression model was used to determine whether the following factors influenced outpatient mental health service use: age, race/ethnicity, gender, maltreatment history, placement pattern, and behavioral problems as measured by the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: Except for maltreatment history, all independent variables included in the multivariate regression model were statistically significant. The total number of outpatient mental health visits increased with age, male gender, and non-relative foster placements. Relative to Caucasians, visits were lower for Latinos, and Asian/Others, but comparable for African-Americans. Concerning maltreatment history, differences were only found in one category; children experiencing caretaker absence received fewer visits compared to children who did not experience caretaker absence. Children with CBCL Total Problem Scale T-scores of 60 or greater had significantly more visits than those with a score less than 60. Conclusions: Both clinical and non-clinical factors influence outpatient mental health service use by foster children. Limitations imposed by gender, race/ethnicity, and placement setting need to be addressed by child welfare policies. These finding suggest that guidelines are needed to systematically link children in foster care with behavioral problems to appropriate services. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Realistic models of contaminant transport in groundwater demand detailed characterization of the spatial distribution of subsurface hydraulic properties, while at the same time programmatic constraints may limit collection of pertinent hydraulic data. Fortunately, alternate forms of data can be used to improve characterization of spatial variability. We utilize a methodology that augments sparse hydraulic information (hard data) with more widely available hydrogeologic information to generate equiprobable maps of hydrogeologic properties that incorporate patterns of connected permeable zones. Geophysical and lithologic logs are used to identify hydrogeologic categories and to condition stochastic simulations using Sequential Indicator Simulation (SIS). The resulting maps are populated with hydraulic conductivity values using field data and Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS). Maps of subsurface hydrogeologic heterogeneity are generated for the purpose of examining groundwater flow and transport processes at the Faultless underground nuclear test, Central Nevada Test Area (CNTA), through large-scale, three-dimensional numerical modeling. The maps provide the basis for simulation of groundwater flow, while transport of radionuclides from the nuclear cavity is modeled using particle tracking methods. Sensitivity analyses focus on model parameters that are most likely to reduce the long travel times observed in the base case. The methods employed in this study have improved our understanding of the spatial distribution of preferential flowpaths at this site and provided the critical foundation on which to build models of groundwater flow and transport. The results emphasize that the impacts of uncertainty in hydraulic and chemical parameters are dependent on the radioactive decay of specific species, with rapid decay magnifying the effects of parameters that change travel time.

        "Absrtact": "Basin-scale variations in oceanic physical variables are thought to organize patterns of biological response across the Pacific Ocean over decadal time scales. Different physical mechanisms can be responsible for the diverse basin-scale patterns of sea-surface temperature (SST), mixed-layer depth, thermocline depth, and horizontal currents, although they are linked in various ways. In light of various theories and observations, we interpret observed basinwide patterns of decadal-scale variations in upper-ocean temperatures. Evidence so far indicates that large-scale perturbations of the Aleutian Low generate temperature anomalies in the central and eastern North Pacific through the combined action of net surface heat flux, turbulent mixing and Ekman advection. The surface-forced temperature anomalies in the central North Pacific subduct and propagate southwestwards in the ocean thermocline to the subtropics but apparently do not reach the equator. The large-scale Ekman pumping resulting from changes of the Aleutian Low forces western-intensified thermocline depth anomalies that are approximately consistent with Sverdrup theory. These thermocline changes are associated with SST anomalies in the Kuroshio/Oyashio Extension that are of the same sign as those in the central North Pacific, but lagged by several years. The physics of the possible feedback from the SST anomalies to the Aleutian Low, which might close a coupled ocean-atmosphere mode of decadal variability, is poorly understood and is an area of active research. The possible responses of North Pacific Ocean ecosystems to these complicated physical patterns is summarized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Deformation throughout Afar over the past 2 myr has been characterized by widespread and intense crustal fragmentation that results from inhomogeneous extension across the region. In eastern Afar, this situation has evolved to localized extension associated with the westward propagation of the Gulf of Aden/Gulf of Tadjurah seafloor spreading system into the Asal-Ghoubbet Rift. During the gradual process of rift propagation and localization, crustal blocks in eastern Afar sustained clockwise rotations of ~ 11\u00b0. To better understand the processes of rift propagation and localization and how they affect the rest of Afar, we have collected and analyzed over 400 oriented paleomagnetic samples from 67 lava flows from central and southern Afar. Unlike eastern Afar, the mean paleomagnetic direction from central Afar indicates that vertical-axis rotations are statistically insignificant (3.6\u00b0\u00b1 4.4\u00b0), though small clockwise rotations. (<8\u00b0) are permitted. Thus, propagation and localization in central Afar have not had the same influence in causing crustal block rotations or, perhaps more likely, have not reached the same stage of evolution as seen in eastern Afar. In addition, several of the lava flows record intriguing geomagnetic field behavior associated with polarity transitions, excursions, or large secular variation events. Interestingly, the transitional or anomalous virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) tend to cluster in two nearly antipodal regions, one in the northern Pacific Ocean and the other in the southwest Indian Ocean. One lava flow has recorded both of the antipodal transitional components, with the two components residing in magnetic minerals with unblocking temperatures above and below ~ 500\u00b0C, respectively. Reheating and partial remagnetization by the overlying flow cannot explain either of the transitional directions because both differ significantly from that of the reversely magnetized overlying flow. The high-temperature component gives a VGP in the northern Pacific, whereas the lower-temperature component gives a nearly antipodal VGP south of Cape Town, South Africa. Hence, the configuration of the geomagnetic field appears to have jumped nearly instantaneously from a northern-hemisphere transitional state to a southern-hemisphere one during this normal-to-reverse polarity transition.

Blocking adhesion is therefore a target for vaccine development. The receptor-binding site is located in a C-terminal disulphide-bonded loop of each pilin monomer, but functional binding sites are displayed only at the tip of the pilus. A factor complicating vaccination is that different bacterial strains produce distinct, and sometimes highly divergent, pilin variants. It is surprising that all strains still appear to bind a common receptor, asialo-GM1. Here, we present the 1.63 \u00c5 crystal structure of pilin from P. aeruginosa strain PAK. The structure shows that the proposed receptor-binding site is formed by two \u03b2-turns that create a surface dominated by main-chain atoms. Receptor specificity could therefore be maintained, whilst allowing side-chain variation, if the main-chain conformation is conserved. The location of the binding site relative to the proposed packing of the pilus fiber raises new issues and suggests that the current fiber model may have to be reconsidered. Finally, the structure of the C-terminal disulphide-bonded loop will provide the template for the structure-based design of a consensus sequence vaccine. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

Using geochemical modeling techniques presented here, pit lake waters have been theoretically allowed to react for 8.5 a, the approximate time that the North pit had been completely full by 1983. Modeling results predict pH of 7.9 to 8.2, SO4 concentrations of 1503 to 1644 mg/L, TDS of 2054 to 2366 mg/L, and As concentrations ranging from 0.57 in the hypolimnion to 96 mg/L in the epilimnion. In the epilimnion, model results do not match observed As concentrations, suggesting that mechanisms, such as precipitation of arsenate salts or adsorption to mineral surfaces, may control As levels in an actual pit lake system. Adsorption to Fe oxyhydroxide surfaces is questioned by the authors because of the low Fe content in the Getchell system, but adsorption to Al(OH)3 (gibbsite) and clay mineral surfaces may be important in controlling natural As concentrations.",

We concentrate our analysis on direct pecuniary costs of trading, namely transactions taxes (stamp duty) and brokerage charges, which derive directly from regulation. In a novel contribution to the transactions cost literature, we identify stock market performance with various measures of market volatility, and distinguish among market volatility, fundamental volatility and excess volatility; we also propose some simple ways of identifying the separate impact of transactions costs on these volatility measures. Our findings suggest that changes in transactions costs have a significant and dependable effect on share price volatility but the sign of this effect depends critically on the concept of volatility being measured. Among the important lessons for emerging stock markets is that transactions costs are an important factor in share market volatility and the regulatory regime therefore needs to take account of the impact of regulation on such costs. This is particularly important for those emerging stock markets that rely on stamp duty or other transactions taxes as a regulatory tool. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Both sites show strong geochemical and geologic evidences of hydrothermal activity. The geophysical methods consist of two microgravimetric surveys, two 2D geoelectric profiles, a seismic reflection profile and a five seismic refraction profiles. The seismic methods allowed us to locate the main subsurface seismic discontinuities and to evaluate their geometrical relationships. The gravity field was used to constraint the seismic discontinuities, while the electric prospecting let discriminate more conductive areas, which could correspond to an increase in thermal fluid circulation in the investigated sites. The results obtained by the different geophysical methods are in good agreement and permit the definition of a reliable geostructural model of the subsurface setting of the two investigated areas. A low-enthalpy geothermal reservoir constituted by a permeable pyroclastic and lava sequence underlying two shallow impermeable formations was found at Fossa del Fuardo. The reservoir is intersected by some sub-vertical faults/fractures that probably play an important role in convoying the thermal water up to the surface. At the other site, Terme di S. Calogero, the geophysical surveys showed that an intense circulation of fluids affects the subsurface of the area. This circulation concentrates along a ENE-trending fault located at a little distance from the thermal resort. The hot fluids may upraise along the fault if the width of the ascent area is smaller than 20 m. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The magnetostratigraphic time scale provides a record of the occurrence of geomagnetic reversals. The temporal distribution of reversals may be modelled as the realization of an inhomogeneous renewal process; i.e., one in which the intensity, \u03bb(t), or reversal rate is a function of time. Variations in reversal rate occurring on time scales of tens of millions of years are believed to reflect changes in core-mantle boundary conditions influencing the structure of core flow and the field produced by the geodynamo. We present a new estimate for reversal rate variations as a function of time using nonparametric adaptive kernel density estimation and discuss the difficulties in making inferences on the basis of such estimates. Using a technique proposed by Hengartner and Stark (1992a; b; 1995), it is possible to compute confidence bounds on the temporal probability density function for geomagnetic reversals. The method allows the computation of a lower bound on the number of modes required by the observations, thus enabling a test of whether 'bumps' are required features of the reversal rate function. Conservative 95% confidence intervals can then be calculated for the temporal location of a single mode or antimode of the probability density function. Using observations from time interval 0-158 Ma, it is found that the derivative of the rate function must have changed sign at least once. The timing of this sign change is constrained to be between 152.56 and 22.46 Ma at the 95% confidence level. Confidence bounds are computed for the reversal rate under the assumption that the observed reversals are a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson or other renewal process with an arbitrary monotonically increasing rate function from the end of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS) to the present, a zero rate during the CNS, and a monotonically decreasing rate function from M29R at 158 Ma to the onset of the CNS. It is unnecessary to invoke more than one sign change in the derivative of the rate function to fit the observations. There is no incompatibility between our results and a recent assertion that there is an asymmetry in average reversal rate prior to and after the CNS, when the CNS is assumed to be a period of zero reversal rate. Neither can we use our results to reject an alternative hypothesis that rates are essentially constant from 158 to 130 Ma, and from 25 Ma to the present, with an intermediate nonstationary segment.

We first review different models of the FCN resonance parameters (period, damping, strength), as well as different inversion techniques used in gravimetry (analytical, linearised least squares, non-linear generalised inverse, stochastic). We propose then a new Bayesian inversion method since such a probabilistic view allows the most complete and reliable information on the FCN resonance to be obtained. We show the consequences of introducing the positivity of the quality factor Q and, even more important, we show that the null information criterion on this factor allows us to better understand why Q is often underestimated in gravity studies (or even found to be negative) with standard least squares techniques. We apply the Bayesian estimation method to a set of gravity data originating from a 3000-day record (1988-1996) of the superconducting gravimeter (SG T005) near Strasbourg (France), after correction for pressure effects and ocean loading with the help of a recent model derived from satellite altimetry. The marginal distribution found for the eigenperiod is nearly Gaussian and leads to a most probable value of 428 days, in agreement with previous gravity studies. The Q distribution is found to be highly asymmetrical with a flat maximum probability that Q exceeds 105, in agreement with the high values derived from very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) studies. The joint probability laws of the parameters show that strong correlations exist between some couples of parameters. Finally, the important impact of inaccurate ocean loading corrections on the determination of the damping of the eigenmode is pointed out; it appears that wrong ocean corrections may lead to underestimation of Q or, even worse, to generation of negative Q when using standard least squares retrieval techniques applied to gravity data.",

        "Absrtact": "We have used wide-angle seismic data to constrain the internal structure of Tenerife, Canary Islands. The experiment was designed as a seismic fan profile to detect azimuthal variations in the seismic structure of the volcanic edifice and its flanks. Seismic energy was generated using a 75-1 airgun-array on board the RRS Charles Darwin fired every 40 s along a quasi-circular profile around the island of Tenerife, centered on Teide volcano. We present the results obtained from the data recorded by five portable land stations distributed on the island. The travel-times indicate that the averaged P-wave velocity within the volcanic edifice is greater than 6 km/s. The observed travel-times were reduced to residual travel-times by removing the effects of variations in the bathymetry along the profile, variations in the shot-receiver distance, and from local heterogeneities. Negative residual travel-times up to 0.8 s in amplitude indicate that the southwestern part of Tenerife is characterized by a high P-wave velocity zone, coincident with a gravity maximum that was previously modeled as a high-density body forming the core of an old, large mafic volcano. We estimate velocities greater than 7.3 km/s within the anomalous body, suggesting that it represents an intrusive plutonic complex. This high-velocity, high-density body may have played an important role in the evolution of Tenerife, buttressing Las Ca\u00f1adas edifice and preventing the occurrence of landslides in the southern and western areas of Tenerife. The bathymetric high between Tenerife and La Gomera is associated with travel-time delays up to 0.4 s, suggesting that it may be composed of large deposits of lava flows and volcaniclastic materials, probably erupted from the shield massifs of Teno, Roque del Conde, and La Gomera. The post-shield volcanic zones of Santiago and Dorsal rifts also seem to be characterized by moderate high P-wave velocities. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.",

A response analysis is shown to be capable of resolving small non-tidal signals of a few nanogal amplitude arbitrarily close in frequency to large amplitude tidal signals. A synthetic example, in which a small signal is injected into a spectrally rich tidal signal is used to demonstrate how the method is applied and its advantages compared to a conventional analysis. The technique is also applied to the analysis of degree 3 diurnal and semi-diurnal tides in short records. The degree 3 waves are easily separated and a reasonable ocean loading effect for these waves is recovered, despite the fact the open ocean tide is only a few mm in amplitude. Finally, a response analysis is used to separate gravitational tides from the radiation tides at coincident frequencies in both the diurnal and semi-diurnal bands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

RESULTS: Principal factor analysis with varimax rotation resulted in a 5-factor solution distinguishing 5 need types: need for information, need for comfort, need for support, need for assurance and anxiety reduction, and need for proximity and accessibility. The internal consistency of the resulting subscales ranged from 0.80 to 0.62, and all factors were significantly related to each other. The Critical Care Family Needs Inventory subscales were found to be clearly related to the demographic variables age, sex, and education level. CONCLUSION: The reliability and validity of the Dutch-language Critical Care Family Needs Inventory as a diagnostic tool in family needs assessment are supported.",

        "Absrtact": "Field measurements of rip spacing, nearshore morphology, water surface elevation and eulerian and lagrangian flows were made in order to investigate the morphodynamics of a large-scale rip current system at Muriwai Beach, New Zealand. Muriwai is a high-energy meso-tidal beach characterised by modal breaker wave heights of 2.5 m and incident wave periods of 10-15 s. The monitored rip system was characterised by a 400 m long, 75 m wide longshore feeder channel and a 150 m wide rip-neck channel oriented obliquely to the shore and extending over a distance of almost 400 m. During the experiment, the beach evolved from a longshore bar-trough and rip state to a transverse bar and rip configuration. Mean eulerian flow velocities obtained from ducted flowmeters deployed on the margin of the feeder channel and rip-neck were on the order of 1 m s-1 and instantaneous flows were commonly in excess of 2 m s-1. Mean lagrangian surface flow velocities extending from the base of the feeder through to the rip-head were obtained by tracking rip floaters and were on the order of 0.7 m s-1, with maximums in the rip-neck region of 1.4 m s-1. A distinct tidal modulation of rip current flow existed with maximum velocities occurring at low tide and minimum velocities at high tide. Comparison with other rip studies suggests that although the magnitude of the morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes occurring within large-scale rip systems is extreme, the behaviour of these rip systems is very similar to low-energy rips with much smaller spatial scales. There is evidence to suggest that distinct morphodynamic scaling relationships exist between these environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The recordings, from four soil and one rock stations, represent 23 earthquakes (ML 4.9-7.0): PGA varies between 20-260 cm/s2. For each station, mean HVSR curves are calculated for two PGA ranges: <75 cm/s2 and >100 cm/s2 (weak and strong motion). At the soil station, the \"weak\" (linear) and \"strong\" (nonlinear) responses are significantly different. Below 1-1.8 Hz, the nonlinear response exceeds the linear one. Above 2 Hz, the nonlinear response drops below the linear one and above 4-6 Hz below unity (deamplification). From 10 to 16 Hz, the two responses converge. One soil site shows significant negative correlation between resonance frequency and ground acceleration. Such behaviour agrees with other empirical studies and theoretical predictions. Our results imply that the HVSR technique is sensitive to ground-motion intensity and can be used to detect and study nonlinear site response. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The presence of erosive canyons on high latitude passive margins is unusual. Such margins are more normally dominated by subsidence and glacially influenced deposition. However, ten canyons are identified at the edge of the narrow shelf on the North Norwegian margin off the Lofoten Islands, between the Traenadjupet and Andoya slides, on the basis of GLORIA long-range side-scan sonar and contemporaneous 3.5 kHz profiler data, combined with a detailed bathymetry. The canyons are located down-stream of sediments transported through the Lofoten Drift, and the margin is characterized by an absence of cross-shelf troughs. Canyons are up to 420 m deep, U-shaped, display steep gradients in their upper parts, and sediments derived from them have short runout distances onto the continental rise. The canyons are estimated to be 20-30 Ma old, being incised into only thinly covered, lithified, pre-Miocene sediments as a response to Cenozoic uplift. Late Quaternary sedimentation processes associated with the canyons are inferred to occur during both glacials and interglacials. Glacial sedimentation is probably in the form of direct subglacial-debris input, in addition to turbid subglacial meltwater plumes. Interglacial sedimentation processes are probably dominated by the along-shelf transport of sediments by strong ocean currents; canyon heads 'capture' sediment from the shelf. The remobilization of this coarse material and erosion of the canyons occurs through debris flows and turbidity currents. Canyon preservation and continued development can be attributed directly to the comparatively low sedimentation rates during full-glacial conditions, as ice streams, located to the north and south, produce regional depocentres away from this area of relatively slow-flowing ice.

This type of information can be integrated with regional seismotectonic analysis in order to asses the present-day conditions of deformation characterising the area, and to constrain the possible kinematics of the seismogenic structures controlling earthquake activity in this sector of the southern Apennines. The results of our study are also of interest for modelling earthquake sources, since a knowledge of the permeability structure and scaling properties of a faulted rock volume is potentially relevant for simulating the time and space dependent behaviour of fault zones during a seismic cycle.",

All measurements were taken with regard for time of day, in order to counter any complicating diurnal influence on data accuracy. Of the 18 subjects, six lost or had accidently displaced their overnight bandage soft contact lenses the first night immediately after surgery, and 12 retained theirs. The individuals with lost bandage lenses exhibited uniformly thick, swollen corneas. In contrast, the other 12 subjects, with retained lenses, exhibited a stable corneal thickness map, displaying the characteristic relatively thick periphery that transitions to a thinner central region. Moreover, in the six affected subjects, application of a new overnight bandage lens resulted in recovery of the normal thickness pattern on day 2, as opposed to the uniform swelling or oedema of the previous day. In combination, these findings indicate a fluid barrier function on behalf of the bandage soft contact lenses, which allowed the corneal endothelial pump mechanism to counteract any extreme swelling or fluid accumulation. This previously unreported phenomenon helps explain the historical effectiveness of this treatment regimen for corneal bullous, or excessive fluid-retention, conditions. \u00a9 2000 British Contact Lens Association.",

        "Absrtact": "The extent and ecological significance of time spent ('hauled out') on ice by phocid seals are poorly known. In this study, haulout of nine captive harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) was monitored and quantified with recorders attached to the seals. The recorders monitored haulout (presence in or out of salt water). Data were collected continuously from September 1995 to October 1996 near St. John's, Newfoundland (47\u00b038'N). Concurrent data on weather (solar radiation, relative humidity, wind velocity, air temperature) were gathered. All seals hauled out throughout the year and haulout was most prevalent during the night. Solar radiation had the greatest influence on haulout during daylight hours, being positively associated with haulout in spring when most seals underwent moult; this trend was reversed in summer. Haulout was negatively associated with wind velocity during spring (moult). High temperature deterred haulout during summer. These findings emphasize the importance of seasonal variation in factors that influence haulout, suggest that haulout by wild harp seals may occur more commonly outside the moulting period than is generally believed, and have implications for the design and interpretation of aerial surveys of harp seals.",

        "Absrtact": "The effect of night temperature on the flowering of heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive cultivars of potted chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum xgrandiflorum) was examined in four experiments over a period of 4 years. Temperature reductions were imposed only while the plants were under black cloth using a combination of air-conditioning and under-cloth ventilation. The two heat-sensitive cultivars tested were 'Yellow Mandalay' and 'Coral Charm' and the two heat-tolerant cultivars were 'Iridon' and 'Dark Bronze Charm'. Differences in time-to-flower (TTF) between heat tolerance classifications were less than anticipated. TTF was affected the most in 'Iridon', a heat-tolerant cultivar, decreasing by an average of 4.2 days/\u00b0C as mean diurnal temperatures (MT) decreased from about 26\u00b0C to about 23\u00b0C. TTF was affected the least in 'Coral Charm', a heat-sensitive cultivar, decreasing by an average of 2.8 days/\u00b0C over the same range. Inflorescence diameter, on the other hand, increased by as much as 9% in the two heat-sensitive cultivars but by only about 4% in the heat-tolerant cultivars. The results suggest that the heat-tolerant cultivars tested here may have been classified based on consistency of flower quality rather than TTF. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The assimilated mean sea level is based on the model simulation, but modified in the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream based on a dynamic sea level from climatological hydrographic data. Sea level updates are accompanied by vertical thermocline displacement and geostrophic current adjustments away from the equator. Sea level errors were used to weight the sea level updates, with the model forecast errors calculated at low spatial resolution using an adaptive method based on the work of Dee [Dee, D.P., 1995. On-line estimation of error covariance parameters for atmospheric data assimilation, Mon. Wea. Rev. 123, pp. 1128 - 1145]. The modified mean sea levels are very successful at deflecting the western boundary currents to more realistic separation points which results in better surface temperature fronts and diagnosed air-sea heat fluxes, based on temperature relaxation. The altimeter anomalies are successfully assimilated and the model is able to propagate these between assimilation times, although with some degradation and damping of the smaller scale features. Predictions of sea level changes over 10-, 20- and 40-day periods are better than the corresponding persistence forecasts except for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current area where there is little difference. AVHRR and subsurface hydrographic and ADCP current data from WOCE cruises were used for validation, and the model run with altimeter assimilation shows significantly better agreement with these independent data sets than the model simulation, for all areas away from the equator.

Smoking and drinking were measured both as binary and as continuous variables, and diet and exercise were each measured in two ways: 'good' (health promoting) and 'bad' (health damaging). 'Area effects' (unattributed variation by post code sector) were found for 'bad' diet only. 'Good' and 'bad' diet, 'bad' exercise patterns and current smoking were associated with postcode sector deprivation. For 'bad' diet this effect was found only for individuals in more affluent households, and for 'good' exercise and current smoking the association with area deprivation differed between adolescents and adults. We conclude that the influence of area on health related behaviours varies according to the behaviour and the way it is measured, and that the influence of area deprivation and/or of area can vary by age and household deprivation.

As applied to single channel currents, the algorithm has the inability to optimize the rate constants directly. We present here an alternative approach by considering the problem as a general optimization problem. The quasi-Newton method is used for searching the likelihood surface. The analytical derivatives of the likelihood function are derived, thereby maximizing the efficiency of the optimization. Because the rate constants are optimized directly, the approach has advantages such as the allowance for model constraints and the ability to simultaneously fit multiple data sets obtained at different experimental conditions. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm. Comparisons with Baum's reestimation suggest that the approach has a superior convergence speed when the likelihood surface is poorly defined due to, for example, a low signal-to-noise ratio or the aggregation of multiple states having identical conductances.",

        "Absrtact": "Significant areas of agricultural lands are subject to seasonal, relatively thin snow covers. This cover affects temperature and moisture in the soil beneath, watershed hydrology, and energy budgets. The depth of snow impacts soil freezing with implications for soil hydraulic properties and over-winter survival of certain crops. The objective of this study was to incorporate a sophisticated snow cover routine into the atmosphere-land exchange (ALEX) model to simulate snow depths and dynamics of the relatively thin snowpacks of the US Upper Midwest. The ALEX model is used in several agricultural modeling projects, and as the land-surface parameterization in a mesoscale forecast model, but with only crude snow cover treatment. We combined parameterizations and empiricisms from the literature with the ALEX structure. Only three parameters were adjusted to find a set that worked well for 48 station years from three sites in Wisconsin. These were a correction for gauge catch deficiency, the air temperature that differentiates rain from snow, and a parameter related to drainage of liquid water from a melting snowpack. A further independent test included 13 years from one site in Minnesota. The air temperature differentiating rain from snow was also determined by analysis of weather observations, independently of the snow model. Both this analysis and the model revealed 0\u00b0C to be the best choice for this temperature in our region. Results showed that with a minimum of calibration the model gives good predictions of continuous snow depth, capturing critical processes of accumulation, ablation and melt in a wide variety of situations. Discrepancies between model and measurements generally originated from a single event and were mainly attributed to processes of blowing snow, misclassification of precipitation type, and anomalous new snow densities. Our results demonstrated the robustness of existing parameterizations and empiricisms for translating environmental observations into snow depth in dynamic simulation models.

Both years combined, 3364 adult and 653 yearling hinds were diagnosed pregnant in June by ultrasound scanning and monitored for reproductive success up to weaning. At weaning, pre-rut at approximately 100 days after calving, udders were palpated or observed by the farmer and hinds were categorised as lactating (wet) indicating survival of calf, or not lactating (dry). Farm management practices during calving and early lactation were recorded. Analysis of risk factors associated with progeny survival was done using path analysis (separately for adult and yearling hinds). Adult hinds >3 years old at calving, conceiving before 1 May and having a body-condition score >2 in September had 2.8, 2.4 and 2.9 times significantly higher odds of rearing a calf to weaning than other hinds, respectively. Adult hinds had about 5 times lower odds of rearing a calf to weaning when they were mixed with mature stags during calving. When farmers visited calving paddocks and checked for calving problems, adult hinds had 1.7 times higher odds of rearing a calf to weaning. When the farmer entered calving paddocks at least every second time they observed the hinds, yearling hinds had a twice higher odds of rearing a calf up to weaning. Sunny weather and high maximum temperatures were positively and negatively associated, respectively, with the probability of an adult hind being in lactation at weaning.

        "Absrtact": "Toxocara canis is a widely distributed nematode parasite which reaches maturity in dogs. However, eggs voided by canid animals are infective to a very wide range of paratenic hosts including humans. In noncanid hosts, infective larvae emerge from the eggs and invade the soft tissues, often entering the brain and musculature. Such larvae may remain for many months or years in these tissues without further growth or differentiation, and yet appear to evade inflammatory reactions or other modes of immune attack. To understand the ability of T. canis larvae to survive in the immunocompetent host, we have undertaken a molecular analysis of the major genes expressed at this stage. By a combination of protein sequencing, gene identification, and expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis we have characterised a range of potentially important gene products from this parasite. Some of these are homologues of prominent mammalian proteins such as C-type lectins (represented by the secreted products TES-32 and TES-70), and mucins (TES-120), and additional products show strong similarities to known cysteine proteases, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins and other ligands. A number of these proteins include a conspicuous 36-amino acid motif containing six cysteines. This domain (termed NC6 or SXC) appears to be an evolutionarily mobile module, which in T. canis is combined with a spectrum of diverse functional domains in different genes. In addition, we have identified a set of novel gene sequences that show no resemblance to any genes encoded by the free-living nematode C. elegans. Four of these are designated abundant novel transcripts, and collectively these account for nearly 20% of the cDNA isolated from the arrested infective stage. Such parasite-specific genes expressed at a high level by a stage that shows remarkable endurance may represent critical products necessary for the success of the parasitic mode of life.

        "Absrtact": "Habitat restoration encompasses a broad range of activities, emphasizing very different issues, goals, and approaches depending on the operational definition of 'restoration'. This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish 'restoration' efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic - pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived from oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be our focus here. In this review, we examine some of the restoration efforts made in the name of fisheries enhancement, address their effectiveness, and discuss some of the issues associated with realizing the broader goal of ecological restoration. We note the importance of linking success criteria to specific goals and make the case for a greater need in clarifying the ecological functions of shellfish and shellfish habitats. We recognize the limitations of existing datasets and summarize ongoing attempts to address oyster habitat restoration throughout the broad geographic distribution of the American oyster. Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over 'attraction versus production' associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves. The necessity of ecosystem (adaptive) management strategies emerges from this discussion. Finally, this overview supports our contention that shellfish habitat should be included in discussions of essential fish habitats' (or EFH). (C) Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The living skeleton can be labeled for life by the administration of radiologically trivial amounts of 41Ca tracer. After initial elimination of tracer from the readily exchangeable calcium pools subsequent skeletal calcium turnover maintains and modulates the urine 41Ca content. Uniquely, bone calcium metabolism may then be studied with tracer in near equilibrium with the body's calcium and resorbing calcium directly measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of excreta. Our experiments with 25 41Ca labeled subjects demonstrate excellent diurnal stability and remarkable response to intervention of the urine signal. Thus the tracer method may prove a competitive means of measuring the effects of antiresorptive osteoporosis treatments, for therapy development or even clinical monitoring. Novel studies of long-term skeletal evolution are also possible. We realize that routinely administered short-lived calcium radiotracers contain 41Ca impurities and that thousands of experimental participants have been historically inadvertently 41Ca labeled. The 41Ca urine index might now rapidly further be characterized by contemporary measurements of these one-time subjects, and with their by now thoroughly skeleton-equilibrated tracer they might be ideal participants in other new experiments. We are also investigating 45Ca AMS. It may prove preferable to label the skeleton with this radiotracer already familiar to bioscientists, but new to AMS. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The term 'loess' is an acronym for 'local regression' and the entire procedure is a fairly direct generalization of traditional least-squares methods for data analysis. Loess is nonparametric in the sense that the fitting technique does not require an a priori specification of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Although it is used most frequently as a scatterplot smoother, loess can be generalized very easily to multivariate data; there are also inferential procedures for confidence intervals and other statistical tests. For all of these reasons, loess is a useful tool for data exploration and analysis in the social sciences. And, loess should be particularly helpful in the field of elections and voting behavior because theories often lead to expectations of nonlinear empirical relationships even though prior substantive considerations provide very little guidance about precise functional forms.

        "Absrtact": "To investigate the relative importance of size and polarizability in ligand binding within proteins, we have determined the crystal structures of pseudo wild-type and cavity-containing mutant phage T4 lysozymes in the presence of argon, krypton, and xenon. These proteins provide a representative sample of predominantly apolar cavities of varying size and shape. Even though the volumes of these cavities range up to the equivalent of five xenon atoms, the noble gases bind preferentially at highly localized sites that appear to be defined by constrictions in the walls of the cavities, coupled with the relatively large radii of the noble gases. The cavities within pseudo wild-type and L121A lysozymes each bind only a single atom of noble gas, while the cavities within mutants L133A and F153A have two independent binding sites, and the L99A cavity has three interacting sites. The binding of noble gases within two double mutants was studied to characterize the additivity of binding at such sites. In general, when a cavity in a protein is created by a 'large-to-small' substitution, the surrounding residues relax somewhat to reduce the volume of the cavity. The binding of xenon and, to a lesser degree, krypton and argon, tend to expand the volume of the cavity and to return it closer to what it would have been had no relaxation occurred. In nearly all cases, the extent of binding of the noble gases follows the trend xenon > krypton > argon. Pressure titrations of the L99A mutant have confirmed that the crystallographic occupancies accurately reflect fractional saturation of the binding sites. The trend in noble gas affinity can be understood in terms of the effects of size and polarizability on the intermolecular potential. The plasticity of the protein matrix permits repulsion due to increased ligand size to be more than compensated for by attraction due to increased ligand polarizability. These results have implications for the mechanism of general anesthesia, the migration of small ligands within proteins, the detection of water molecules within apolar cavities and the determination of crystallographic phases.

In addition to the stretched sigma coordinate, novel features of the model include the utilization of a weakly dissipative, third-order scheme for tracer advection, and a conservative and constancy-preserving time-stepping algorithm. The objectives of the study are to assess the quality of the new terrain-following model in the limit of realistic basin-scale simulations, and to compare the results obtained with it against those of other North Atlantic models used in recent multi-model comparison studies. The new model is able to reproduce many features of both the wind-driven and thermohaline circulation, and to do so within error bounds comparable with prior model simulations (e.g., CME and DYNAMO). Quantitative comparison with comparable results obtained with the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Model (MICOM) show our terrain-following solutions are of similar overall quality when viewed against known measures of merit including meridional overturning and heat flux, Florida Straits and Gulf Stream transport, seasonal cycling of temperature and salinity, and upper ocean currents and tracer fields in the eastern North Atlantic Basin. Sensitivity studies confirm that the nonlinear vertical coordinate contributes significantly to model fidelity, and that the global inventories and spatial structure of the tracer fields are affected in important ways by the choice of lateral advection scheme.

Assuming that v is independent of temperature gives a \u03b4K/\u03b4T value of -19.3 \u00b1 0.64 MPa K-1 at 0.5 GPa. We used the experimental data, in combination with published data, to calculate bounds on the elastic moduli of a peridotite hydrated with talc just above cold subducting lithosphere. We find that an assemblage hydrated by only 0.9 wt% H2O has elastic wave volocities (calculated from the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average) lower than the anhydrous rock by an average of 7.6% for Vp, and 9.7% for shear waves (V5) at 700\u00b0C. These results are consistent with observations of converted phase behavior in the vicinity of the surface of a coid subducting slab, and may place the low-velocity layer observed in the lowermost mantle wedge, not the uppermost slab as has previously been suggested. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

These data were obtained in the context of a clinical practice and not in a clinical trial. We looked into the correlations between patient characteristics and time of death and/or disease-free interval. Patients and methods: We first analyzed the characteristics of a population of patients that had died from breast cancer (n = 295), then of a population including patients still alive 7 years after surgery (n = 344). We used correspondence analysis (CA) which is based on \u03c72-metrics, does not assume linear relationships, and provides graphic overviews. Results: The CA mapped variables (clinical stage, histoprognostic grade, node status, receptor positivity) in a way that fits in well with available knowledge on their importance as prognostic factors. We observed, however, that death occurred during three main periods (1-3, 4-7, \u22648 years after surgery) defined by different mixes of variables as if the disease progressed by stage rather than continuously. The CA distinguished long-term survivors (>7 years) from patients who died 8-10 years after surgery. Long-term survivors tended to be node-negative; those who died at 8-10 years tended to be the youngest patients (under 40). Conclusions: Because correspondence analysis combines the advantages of multidimensional and non-linear methods, it is a valuable exploratory tool for describing multiple correlations within a population before attempting to establish statistical significance of selected variables by more classic methods. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

One recording of visual evoked potentials, and recordings of auditory evoked potentials from four subjects corresponding to different age groups are analyzed. We find higher variability in older individuals. Moreover, since the EPs are identified at the single stimulus level (without need of ensemble averaging), this will allow the calculation of better resolved averages.

It provides a way to an efficient implementation of the algorithm for geocoding the pixels of an interferogram. The method is preferably applicable to spaceborne dual-pass interferometry, and independent of the orbit configuration. An accuracy analysis of object point positioning is conducted and results of geocoding an ERS tandem interferogram are shown.",

        "Absrtact": "The major-element composition of a grain of peridotitic Cr-pyrope garnet, coupled with a temperature estimate (T(Ni)) derived from its Ni content, can be used to calculate the forsterite (Fo) content (100Mg/(Mg+Fe)) of the coexisting olivine, using an inversion of the olivine-garnet Mg-Fe exchange geothermometer. This calculation reproduces Fo(oliv) in garnet peridotite xenoliths within \u00b10.5%. Because the T(Ni) of garnet xenocrysts in volcanic rocks can be projected to a paleogeotherm to derive a depth estimate, the application of the technique applied to suites of such xenocrysts provides a means of mapping the average Fo(oliv) of the mantle as a function of depth. Application of the technique to garnet concentrates from kimberlites and other volcanic rocks from Siberia, Australia, Canada and South Africa shows a decrease in mean Fo(oliv) with depth in most cratonic lithospheric sections. Near the base of most sections, Fo(oliv) approaches the value (Fo89-90) expected for asthenospheric mantle. The increase in Fo(oliv) toward the top of the sections is consistent with the higher degrees of partial melting at shallow depth predicted by models of melting during adiabatic decompression. However, trace-element data on the garnets suggest that these trends probably reflect more extensive melt-related metasomatism toward the base of the lithosphere. Lithospheric sections from some localities known to host lower-mantle diamonds (Slave Craton, South Australia) show that the lithospheric mantle consists of at least two distinct layers, which may reflect diapiric addition to the lower lithosphere. In the upper parts of these sections, the mean Fo(oliv) of the lithospheric mantle decreases from Archean (Fo93-94) through Proterozoic to Phanerozoic (Fo90-91.5), reflecting a secular decrease in the average degree of melt extraction from newly created lithospheric mantle. These variations in Fo(oliv) significantly affect lithosphere density and should be considered in modelling gravity and seismic data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Background. Mutations of PKD1 are thought to account for approximately 85% of all mutations in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The search for PKD1 mutations has been hindered by both its large size and complicated genomic structure. To date, few mutations that affect the replicated segment of PKD1 have been described, and virtually all have been reported in Caucasian patients. Methods. In the present study, we have used a long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy previously developed by our laboratory to analyze exons in the replicated region of PKD1 in a population of 41 unrelated Thai and 6 unrelated Korean families with ADPKD. We have amplified approximately 3.5 and approximately 5 kb PKD1 gene-specific fragments (5'MR and 5'LR) containing exons 13 to 15 and 15 to 21 and performed single-stand conformation analysis (SSCA) on nested PCR products. Results. Nine novel pathogenic mutations were detected, including six nonsense and three frameshift mutations. One of the deletions was shown to be a de novo mutation. Four potentially pathogenic variants, including one 3 bp insertion and three missense mutations, were also discovered. Two of the nonconservative amino acid substitutions were predicted to disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the PKD repeats. In addition, six polymorphisms, including two missense and four silent nucleotide substitutions, were identified. Approximately 25% of both the pathogenic and normal variants were found to be present in at least one of the homologous loci. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mutation analysis of the replicated region of PKD1 in a non-Caucasian population. The methods used in this study are widely applicable and can be used to characterize PKD1 in a number of ethnic groups using DNA samples prepared using standard techniques. Our data suggest that gene conversion may play a significant role in producing variability of the PKD1 sequence in this population. The identification of additional mutations will help guide the study of polycystin-1 and better help us to understand the pathophysiology of this common disease.",

In this paper, we describe the temporal variability of TEAP conditions in shallow groundwater contaminated with both waste fuel and chlorinated solvents. TEAP parameters (including methane, dissolved iron, and dissolved hydrogen) were measured to characterize the contaminant plume over a 3-year period. We observed that concentrations of TEAP parameters changed on different time scales and appear to be related, in part, to recharge events. Changes in all TEAP parameters were observed on short time scales (months), and over a longer 3-year period. The results indicate that (1) interpretations of TEAP conditions in aquifers contaminated with a variety of organic chemicals, such as those with petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents, must consider additional hydrogen-consuming reactions (e.g., dehalogenation); (2) interpretations must consider the roles of both in situ (at the sampling point) biogeochemical and solute transport processes; and (3) determinations of microbial communities are often necessary to confirm the interpretations made from geochemical and hydrogeological measurements on these processes.

The theoretical basis for the proposed Gas-based cylindricity evaluation algorithms is first presented. The performance of the method under various combinations of parameters and the precision improvement on the evaluation of cylindricity are carefully analyzed. One numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and to compare the Gas-based modeling results with those obtained by the least-squares method. Numerical results indicate that the proposed GAs method does provide better accuracy on cylindricity evaluation. The method can also be extended for solving difficult form error minimization and profile evaluation problems of various geometric parts in engineering metrology.",

        "Absrtact": "The extent and mechanisms of adsorption of marine pore water organic matter to montmorillonite were studied in a series of batch and sequential adsorption experiments. Pore water natural organic matter (pNOM) and easily extracted natural organic matter (eNOM) were collected from Liberty Bay (Puget Sound, WA, USA) sediments. The pNOM and eNOM were each divided into two size fractions using a 1000 D ultrafilter. Batch adsorption isotherms were approximately linear, and the > 1000 D fractions of both pNOM and eNOM had larger partition coefficients (K(d)) than the < 1000 D fractions. A two-component fit of the sequential adsorption data indicated that pNOM and eNOM contained a similar amount of NOM (30%) that was not surface reactive toward montmorillonite. After correcting the batch adsorption K(d)s for the non-reactive components, the K(d)s estimated by batch and sequential adsorption were identical (~ 2.7 1/kg for > 1000 D pNOM and eNOM, and ~ 1.6 1/kg for < 1000 D pNOM and eNOM). Mechanisms of adsorption were investigated by systematically changing conditions (pH, temperature and ionic composition) of > 1000 D fractions during batch isotherm experiments. Adsorption of NOM was found to decrease with increased temperature, suggesting that hydrophobic effects were not the dominant adsorption mechanisms in this system. Ion exchange was also not an important adsorption mechanism because adsorption increased with ionic strength. The observed enhancement in adsorption with ionic strength indicated that van der Waals interactions were important in the adsorption of NOM. Ligand exchange was found to be a significant mechanism since the presence of SO4/2- in solution reduced the amount of NOM adsorbed. Ca2+ enhanced adsorption slightly more than Na+, suggesting that cation bridging was involved. The relative contributions of van der Waals interactions, ligand exchange and cation bridging were estimated to be approximately 60%, 35% and 5%, respectively, for adsorption of NOM in a CaCl2 solution.

Here we summarize what is known, and suspected, about the couplings between the marine atmospheric sulfur cycle, other atmospheric chemical cycles, and the dynamics and microphysics of the marine atmospheric boundary layer.

The data confirm that in the remote marine atmosphere, DMS is a central player in a variety of important atmospheric processes, reinforcing the need to understand quantitatively the factors that regulate DMS emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere.

However, no analytical procedures have been published to determine bromine stable isotope composition in natural samples, probably due to expected analytical difficulties and the expected similarity with chlorine isotopic compositions, or even because no (significant) isotopic fractionation was expected at all. We describe a method for measuring the stable bromine isotope composition in natural samples with a precision of better than 0.18\u2030. A sample containing 2-5 mg bromide is mixed with K2Cr2O7 and H2SO4. This mixture is boiled and during this process Br- is oxidised to Br2 and distilled, while Cl- is not. Thus chlorine and bromine are separated. The Br2 is reduced back to Br- and precipitated as AgBr. This is reacted with CH3I and CH3Br is formed. The gas mixture is separated by gas chromatography, and the pure CH3Br is measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. The technique has been tested on a set of natural samples (oil field formation waters) with a known chlorine isotope range between 0\u2030 and -5\u2030(SMOC). The bromine isotope range in these sample was found to be between 0\u2030 and +1.8\u2030(SMOB), indicating that processes fractionating bromine isotopes are different from those fractionating chlorine isotopes.

By studying the conditions that are observed when the global irradiance on a 2-axis-tracked surface is 1000 W/m2, our analysis provides an objective, quantitative basis for the choice of the 'peak-watt' rating conditions for both types of collectors. These observed conditions are consistent with commonly used values of 850 W/m2 for direct-normal irradiance and 20\u00b0C for ambient temperature.

The induction arrows clearly show the effects of induction in the surrounding oceans. Comparison with the responses of an analogue model of the effect of the oceans on induction in the New Zealand region indicates that the induction arrows also contain information on anomalous on-land conductivity structure. The use of difference induction arrows to remove the effect of induction in the oceans from the observed responses is validated using both two- and three-dimensional numerical models pertinent to the New Zealand situation. Difference induction arrows calculated by subtracting the analogue model results from the observed data show a clear reversal, in both real and quadrature arrows, across the South Island. Two-dimensional numerical modeling of the projections of the difference arrows on to the transect shows that the response is consistent with the existence beneath the Southern Alps of an anomalously conducting region previously identified by magnetotelluric (MT) sounding. Use of the difference arrow technique is seen to be valid over a large period band because of the reduction in the coast effect response range as a result of the island situation.

The uppermost (above 40 mbsf) section of three separate holes (Holes 1037 B, 1038 I and 1038 G) was sampled; previous sedimentological and geochemical studies indicated that these holes represent a transect from unaltered to strongly hydrothermally influenced sediments. Analysis of NRM, ARM, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), hysteresis parameters and low-temperature magnetic properties suggest increasing alteration of the magnetic minerals with increasing circulation of hydrothermal circulation of fluids. Fuzzy c-means clustering combined with non-linear mapping yields a more elaborate picture because similar alteration groupings at different holes can be compared. At Hole 1037 B, a sedimentary reference site drilled away from the area of high heat flow, the rock-magnetic signal is a sensitive record of changes in detrital inputs. Magnetite and some monoclinic pyrrhotite are detected. The detrital magnetic signal is still apparent at intermediate Hole 1038 I, but cluster analysis detects an increasing hydrothermal influence on the magnetomineralogy in the lower part of the hole. Strong hydrothermal alteration at Hole 1038 G results in a complete loss of the detrital/diagenetic magnetic signal, which is replaced by a much weaker 'hydrothermal' signal composed of monoclinic pyrrhotite and pyrite. The alteration of the magnetic signal is not restricted to the uppermost few meters of the sediment column and the magnetic properties of the sediment can be used to trace even minor alterations of marine sediments related to the lateral and vertical advection of hydrothermal fluids which may easily be overlooked by more traditional methods.

        "Absrtact": "Most models for fault growth and scaling are based on analysis of faults which display dip-slip (i.e. reverse, normal) and strike-slip kinematics; by contrast, little information is derived from faults displaying oblique-slip kinematics. Observations on mesoscopic transpressional faults from the Salinian Block of California and transtensional faults from the Southern Apennines of Italy reveal a complex kinematic history of fault propagation. Faults initially nucleate as isolate segments, which are later kinematically and mechanically linked via development of diffuse deformation zones and/or localised oblique connecting splays. The geometry of observed mesoscopic faults is similar to that of the host, larger structures, thus suggesting that the produced fault patterns are scale independent. Moreover, the overprinting relationships among minor fault-related fabrics permit to define a relative chronology within fault arrays, thus enabling a general sequence of structural stages to be correctly established. Based on minor fabrics and their overprinting relationships, a kinematic deformation model of fault growth by segment linkage is presented, which may have a wide applicability in the field of seismic hazard evaluation.",

The benthic foraminifera prove to be excellent indicators of variations in the oxygen contents of the bottom waters, even more so than the stable isotopes. Our data indicate a step-wise restriction of the Mediterranean-Atlantic water exchange resulting in increasing sluggishness of deep-water circulation. The first indication of restricted circulation is seen at 8.5 Ma, which may correspond to a severe restriction of the external zone of the Betic Strait. A second event, which had a very serious influence on the fauna in the deeper Mediterranean, occurred at 7.16 Ma. This event was presumably linked to the partial closure of the Rifian Corridor. The restricted Mediterranean-Atlantic connection also seems to have led to a gradual salinity increase and possibly to the formation of a brine in the deepest basins, thus marking the first development towards the Messinian Salinity Crisis.

        "Absrtact": "Mysids are used routinely by regulatory authorities for conducting 96 h LC50 toxicity tests to evaluate the potential hazards of pollutants to aquatic ecosystems. Data from these acute tests suggest that the European estuarine mysid Neomysis integer (Peracarida: Mysidacea) is comparatively sensitive to trace metals and organophosphate pesticides, and may be a suitable alternative to the frequently-used sub-tropical American mysid Americamysis (\u2261Mysidopsis) bahia for testing the toxicity of chemical contaminants to European estuarine biota. There is, however, growing demand for the development of toxicity tests which are more representative of the effects of toxic contaminants on natural populations, and which provide results that are more readily extrapolated to natural ecosystems, than acute tests. Behavioural disruption, particularly of swimming ability, is used increasingly in laboratory toxicity studies as a sensitive endpoint for assessing the effects of contaminants on aquatic biota. This paper describes a sensitive laboratory technique, using an annular flume, to determine the effects of an organophosphate pesticide on the swimming behaviour of N. integer. Following 7-day exposure to 0.038 \u03bcg chlorpyrifos l-1, mysids became hyperactive and more swam forward into a slow current (3 cm s-1) than control mysids. Despite this hyperactivity, pesticide-exposed mysids were unable to swim faster than 15 cm s-1, whereas control mysids were able to swim faster than 18 cm s-1. Other changes in swimming behaviour following pesticide exposure included fewer mysids maintaining position, and more mysids swimming with the current at high current velocities (18 cm s-1), than control individuals. These responses of chlorpyrifos-exposed N. integer are predicted to cause reduced ability of N. integer to maintain position in the natural estuarine habitat. Furthermore, the swimming behaviour of N. integer was affected at pesticide concentrations below the 7 day LC50 (0.084 \u03bcg chlorpyrifos l-1), highlighting the importance of using sub-lethal toxicity studies for predicting environmental consequences of pollutant discharge.

        "Absrtact": "Ammonia fluxes were measured semi-continuously over oilseed rape (Brassica napus) as part of the EXAMINE North Berwick experiment during ripening of the growing plants and following cutting prior to harvest. The first period was investigated intensively, including flux measurements by continuous wet denuders at six heights, as well as by filter packs and passive flux samplers. The aerodynamic gradient method and eddy covariance were applied to estimate friction velocity (u*), sensible heat fluxes (H) and latent heat fluxes (\u03bbE), with best estimates provided by inter-comparisons for each. The measurements represent a major exercise in data acquisition and processing, and provide approximately 30 days of semi-continuous fluxes. The largest errors in estimating the NH3 fluxes arise from the concentration profile measurements. Fluxes from the ripening canopy were bi-directional, varying in the range - 150 to 180 ng m-2 s-1 with the largest emission fluxes during the day, and both emission and deposition occurring at night. Larger net emissions were measured following cutting of the rape (up to 620ng m-2 s-1), with an overall mean of 57 ng m-2 s-1 compared with 16 ng m-2 s-1 prior to cutting. The patterns may be explained in relation to the expected major driving forces controlling exchange (cuticular fluxes, foliar compensation point, leaf litter emissions), the link to temperature/wetness, and the potential for overlying leaves to recapture emissions from leaf litter. The comparison with the passive estimates indicates that continuous measurements of several months duration are required to make a reliable assessment of the passive approach.

The denatured relative molecular mass values were estimated to be 40 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isolated enzyme from Aplysia gave a K(m) value of 0.6 mM for arginine and a V(max) value of 13 \u03bcmole Pi min-1 mg protein-1 for the forward reaction. These values are comparable to other molluscan AKs. The cDNAs encoding Cellana and Aplysia AKs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the nucleotide sequences of 1608 and 1239 bp, respectively, were determined. The open reading frame for Cellana AK is 1044 nucleotides in length and encodes a protein with 347 amino acid residues, and that for A. kurodai is 1077 nucleotides and 354 residues. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequences were validated by chemical sequencing of internal lysyl endopeptidase peptides. The amino acid sequences of Cellana and Aplysia AKs showed the highest percent identity (66-73%) with those of the abalone Nordotis and turbanshell Battilus belonging to the same class Gastropoda. These AK sequences still have a strong homology (63-71%) with that of the chiton Liolophura (class Polyplacophora), which is believed to be one of the most primitive molluscs. On the other hand, these AK sequences are less homologous (55-57%) with that of the clam Pseudocardium (class Bivalvia), suggesting that the biological position of the class Polyplacophora should be reconsidered.

Moreover, despite the existence of an important electoral pool on the Extreme Right, which possesses both Left-wing economic and Right-wing ethnocentric attitudinal bases to its Eurosceptic position, the nature of the economic issues on which these voters hold a Left-wing position reveals a perspective in many ways more compatible with the Extreme Right than with any Left-wing conceptualisation of economic policy. Electorally, this divergence in mass ideological demand would seem to rule out any future long-term partisan realignment around the European issue. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our approach combines pseudo-maximum-likelihood fitting of GARCH models to estimate the current volatility and extreme value theory (EVT) for estimating the tail of the innovation distribution of the GARCH model. We use our method to estimate conditional quantiles (VaR) and conditional expected shortfalls (the expected size of a return exceeding VaR), this being an alternative measure of tail risk with better theoretical properties than the quantile. Using backtesting of historical daily return series we show that our procedure gives better 1-day estimates than methods which ignore the heavy tails of the innovations or the stochastic nature of the volatility. With the help of our fitted models we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to estimating the conditional quantiles of returns over multiple-day horizons and find that this outperforms the simple square-root-of-time scaling method. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The spatial variability of basic aquifer parameters, hydraulic conductivity, and sorption parameters of the aquifer material was investigated in detail. Local Darcian velocities were measured using NH4Br82 as a radioactive tracer in 33 observation wells. Vertical and horizontal correlation lengths of hydraulic properties were determined using variogram analysis. The magnitude of the local Darcian velocities was found to be lognormally distributed. In addition, the groundwater flow direction showed a clear trend in the vertical direction. The horizontal correlation length of the magnitude of Darcian velocity agreed with the correlation length of K estimated from grain size data. Batch experiments on aquifer sediments showed that sorption of uranin and lithium could be described by a Freundlich isotherm. The Freundlich n parameter of uranin sorption showed little variation with depth. The time evolution of the bromide plume was quantified in terms of spatial moments. The longitudinal effective dispersivity estimated from spatial moment analysis was within the range of calculated effective dispersivities, taking into account the uncertainty of estimates of the lnK statistics. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The combination of rational and combinatorial methods opens up new vistas in the design of stable and efficient enzymes.",

        "Absrtact": "High-precision garnet chronometry using the Sm-Nd, U-Pb, Rb-Sr or Lu-Hf isotope systems is gaining widespread application for constraining the prograde and high-temperature history of metamorphic belts. However, due to the low concentrations of the chronometrically important elements, garnet analyses are often susceptible to incorporation of small quantities of accessory phases such as zircon, monazite and allanite. Here we assess the extent to which such inclusions affect garnet analyses by comparing in situ analyses of Sm and Nd concentrations in the crystal lattice, obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with those obtained by isotope dilution (ID) on separates of the same garnets. The results show that the garnets studied here are largely free from inclusions. In general, however, the low concentrations of Sm and Nd in the garnet lattice mean that the incorporation of even very small quantities of accessory phases will result in a significant change in the measured garnet Sm and Nd concentration. Simple modelling of the effect of such inclusions on age information shows that garnet inclusion disequilibrium and the extent to which inclusions decrease the apparent parent-daughter ratio are critical. Such modelling demonstrates that the incorporation of old LREE-enriched minerals such as monazite will yield an apparently lower age than the true garnet age. However, this study indicates that erroneous age information can be identified if duplicate garnet analyses are performed. In addition, LA-ICP-MS is shown to be a useful technique in verifying the purity of samples for isotope analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Calcareous dinoflagellate cysts appear to be widely distributed throughout the studied area. In the surface sediments, concentrations (cyst per gram dry sediment) of the vegetative stage Thoracosphaera heimii are generally higher than that of the (presumably) calcareous resting cysts. Distribution patterns in surface sediments of Orthopithonella granifera (Futterer) Keupp and Versteegh, Rhabdothorax spp. Kamptner., Sphaerodinella albatrosiana (Kamptner) Keupp and Versteegh S. albatrosiana praratabulated, Sphaerodinella tuberosa var. 1 (Kamptner) Keupp and Versteegh and S. tuberosa var. 2 and the ratios between these species have been compared with temperature, salinity, density and stratification gradients in the upper water column. Rhabdothorax spp. is characteristically present in sediments of more temperate regions characterized by high seasonality. Dinoflagellates producing these cysts are able to tolerate high nutrient concentrations, and mixing of the water column. S. albatrosiana is abundant in regions characterized by high sea surface temperatures and oligotrophic surface water conditions. In contrast, the distribution of S. tuberosa var. 2 is negatively related to temperature. The other cyst species did not show a characteristic pattern in relation to the studied environmental gradients. The ratio of Sphaerodinella tuberosa var. 2 to Orthopithonella granifera can be used for reconstructing the presence of stratification in the upper 50 m of the water column, whereas the ratios of S. tuberosa var. 2 to Sphaerodinella albatrosiana and of O. granifera to Rhabdothorax spp. might be used for palaeotemperature reconstructions. Calcareous dinoflagellate cysts are abundant in oligotrophic areas and may be useful for the reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Whilst the interplay between tectonics, glaciation and oceanography is reasonably well understood on some high-latitude margins, relatively little is known about the nature of Quaternary processes affecting the continental margin north of the Faeroe Islands. We therefore present side-scan sonar (GLORIA and TOBI) and 3.5 kHz data in combination with a new regional bathymetry in order to characterise and analyse the margin's physiography and the sedimentary processes that have occurred in the area during the Late Quaternary. Seven acoustic facies are identified and interpreted, in combination with published core records. The margin is subject to differing sedimentation regimes over glacial/interglacial cycles, relating to the changing importance of contouritic, hemipelagic, glacimarine and mass-movement processes. Mass movement is much more extensive than previously thought, with a total sediment volume of >2000 km3, similar to that of the Storegga Slide (5500 km3) and may occur primarily at glacial terminations. The downslope limit of instabilities is associated with a series of channels, focusing the deposition of distal, turbiditic sediments into the regional deep beyond. Together with glacigenic debris flows from the western margin of the North Sea Fan, mass-movement processes are identified to have affected 52-70% of the North Faeroes margin area. In contrast, distal glacimarine sedimentation, alternating with hemipelagic and contouritic development, is found on the remaining 30-48% of the margin during glacials, and hemipelagic and contouritic Sedimentation are active across 90% of the margin in interglacial conditions. Despite a lack of any local, direct glacial influence, these observations on the relative importance of sedimentation processes are comparable with other glacially influenced passive margins.

Starbursts seem to be normal in their hot star IMF but short lived due to strong negative feedback. Mid-infrared emission lines and continuum features provide new diagnostics to discriminate between starburst and AGN activity in obscured galaxies. Using these tools, we find that most ultraluminous infrared galaxies are predominantly starburst powered. \u00a9 Elsevier Science B.V.",

To examine these relationships during routine clinical treatment, we studied patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder undergoing hospital treatment for acute psychotic exacerbations with doctor's choice medications. There were 34 subjects observed for at least 2 weeks. They were assessed at baseline and weekly by one rater with the Anchored Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and by another rater with the Barnes Rating Scale for akathisia, with the two raters blind to each other's ratings. Serum ferritin and transferrin levels were obtained at baseline. Seventeen subjects developed akathisia. Subjects with and without akathisia did not differ in change in thinking disturbance or anxiety-depression scores over 2 weeks, or in serum ferritin or transferrin levels. We conclude that mild akathisia by itself is not strongly associated with initial response to low to moderate doses of antipsychotics in the acute clinical setting. Limitations of the study are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

In this paper we look at the kinds of relationships observed at the company level in the emerging area of telemedicine. The linkages here are expected to be vertical between companies as well as horizontal. The data are derived from Japanese databases on both publications and patents, using keywords to identify imaging and communications related technological fields. Using multidimensional scaling techniques, we find marked distinctions at the company level between image and communications fields, and hence little evident fusion within companies. Using principal component analyses, we find specializations in imaging fields but greater clustering across communications fields. The latter are seen as providing the technological infrastructure for the former to develop within. At the industry level, NTT publishes a higher proportion of papers than it takes out patents, and this provides scientific infrastructure for the overall system. Specialist companies then undertake product development. Fusion thus takes place more at the industry level than the company level in telemedicine.",

Detailed knowledge of the effects of those parameters is essential for crystallization. The concept of the so-called 'ionic strength reducers' provides insight into the changes of solubility induced by organic solvents and hydrophilic polymers in aqueous electrolytic solutions. A simple and efficient procedure is presented which exploits the properties of ionic strength reducers in the crystallization of proteins. Using this procedure in the crystallization of the E. coli polyamine-induced protein, superior crystals compared to conventional techniques have been obtained. The procedure combines microseeding with dialysis techniques and is applicable to other proteins, particularly in cases where conditions favoring both for nucleation and growth cannot be found, or in cases where excessive nucleation leads to the growth of a large number of very small crystals.",

        "Absrtact": "Time series of suspended-silt concentration (measured by an optical backscatter sensor) and suspended-sand concentration (measured by an acoustic backscatter sensor) in a deep channel (14 m MSL) of a large New Zealand estuary (Manukau Harbour) are analysed. Suspended-sand concentration varied in phase with the current speed and bed shear stress on a ~ 6.2-h cycle, but suspended-silt concentration varied on a semidiurnal (~ 12.4-h) cycle such that the channel was clear of silt at high tide and maximum silt concentration occurred at low tide. Threshold for initiation of sand motion was found to be related to local skin friction, sand concentration profiles were consistent with settling flux balanced by gradient diffusion with a two-layer sediment diffusivity dependent on local friction velocity, suspended-sand reference concentration was explainable in terms of local skin friction, and changes in the channel-bed sediment were correlated with the suspended-sand load. Therefore, sand suspension in the channel is a 'local' process and the channel bed is the source of the suspended-sand load. Suspended-sand flux was found to be a highly nonlinear function of the tidal current speed in the channel. In that case, tidal-current velocity asymmetry is the principal determinant of direction of net sand transport and the ebb/flood-dominance concept is valid. The relative phase of the M2 and M4 constituents of the tidal-current velocity, which quantifies tidal-current asymmetry, was calculated from a tide model of the estuary and results were mapped. The harbour was found to be broadly ebb dominant and therefore self-flushing of sand. Silt suspension in the channel was not related to the local boundary-layer dynamics, but was explainable in terms of the movement up and down the channel of a horizontal gradient in silt concentration, which implies the existence of a turbid water mass that is perched on the surrounding intertidal flats at high tide and that drains into the channel during ebb tide. Silt concentration in the channel increased during a short storm, which corresponded to the passage through the measurement site of a 'turbid fringe' that was formed on the surrounding intertidal flats during the previous high tide under the action of breaking waves. Wave activity on the surrounding intertidal flats is therefore the principal determinant of suspended-silt load in the channel and an approach that treats waves and sediment pathways between intertidal flats and channels is needed for modelling silt transport.

Cooling rate contour maps, from published apatite and zircon fission-tract ages and Rb/Sr biotite ages, highlight the differential exhumation of large fault-bounded blocks during this phase, whilst synkinematic hydrothermal veins and calc-alkaline dykes (29-32 Ma) help to constrain its age.

Stirring, shifting and relocation of streambed substrates by hand was used to define artificial physical disturbance within the randomly selected sites. The sites were exposed to differing interdisturbance intervals, i.e. short, intermediate and long inter-disturbance intervals. Mayfly species abundances were more similar within the disturbed subsites than between disturbed versus control sites. Individual experiments showed that maximal recolonization of the different sites was relatively short (<8 h) but highly variable. When the three experiments were systematically combined, densities of mayflies recolonizing the disturbed sites were highest on day 19, followed thereafter by a sharp density decline. Mayfly densities on the control sites were highest on days 20 and 40. The effects of short, intermediate and long inter-disturbance intervals on densities of mayflies recolonizing the disturbed sites was bifaceted, which included slight increases and strong declines in the densities.",

There is a growing need for automated, real-time, long-term measurements of CO2 in the ocean using a network of sensors, strategically placed on ships, moorings, free-drifting buoys and autonomous remotely operated vehicles. The ground-truthing of new sensor technologies is a vital component of present and future efforts to monitor changes in the ocean carbon cycle and air-sea exchange of CO2. A comparison of a moored Carbon Interface Ocean Atmosphere (CARIOCA) buoy and shipboard fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) measurements was conducted in the western North Atlantic during two extended periods (> 1 month) in 1997. The CARIOCA buoy was deployed on the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM), which is located 5 km north of the site of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). The high frequency of sampling revealed that temperature and fCO2 responded to physical forcing by the atmosphere on timescales from diurnal to 4-8 days. Concurrent with the deployments of the CARIOCA buoy, frequent measurements of surface fCO2 were made from the R/V Weatherbird II during opportunistic visits to the BTM and BATS sites, providing a direct calibration of the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data. Although, the in situ ground-truthing of the CARIOCA buoy was complicated by diurnal processes, sub-mesoscale and fine-scale variability, the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data was accurate within 3 \u00b1 6 \u03bcatm of shipboard fCO2 data for periods up to 50 days. Longer-term assessments were not possible due to the CARIOCA buoy breaking free of the BTM and drifting into waters with different fCO2-temperature properties. Strategies are put forward for future calibration of other in situ sensors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Five core groups are revealed by the quantitative analysis and interpreted as representing five marine biotic provinces. They are the Cathaysian (tropical), Western Tethyan (tropical), Himalayan (warm temperate), Austrazean (cold temperate) and Greenland - Svalbard Provinces (cold temperate). The Cathaysian Province is composed of many isolated or semi-isolated islands situated in the Palaeotethys, whereas the other four provinces occurred mainly on the continental shelves of Pangea: the Western Tethyan Province along the western coast of the Palaeotethys, the Himalayan Province on the northern margin of Gondwanaland, the Austrazean Province along the southeastern margin of Gondwanaland, and the Greenland - Svalbard Province on the northern margin of Pangea. In addition, nonmetric multidimensional scaling helped to identify key biogeographic determinants: latitude-related thermal gradient appears to have accounted for most of the variance in the data; geographic distance and ocean circulation may have also played a major, but subordinate, role in the delineation and/or enhancement of some of the provinces. Comparison with Early and Middle Permian global marine provincialism indicates that marine biotic provinces had significantly reduced during the Lopingian (Late Permian) in the lead up to the end-Permian mass extinction.

The area is still recovering from the effects of cultivation, logging, forest clearing and grazing during the 1800s and early 1900s, but the data indicated that most stands now contain sawtimber-sized trees after more than 50 years of secondary succession. Our analyses showed that forest types were not randomly associated with soil characteristics or topography. For example, the most heavily gullied lands were strongly associated with pine forests while hardwoods were more associated with upland soils and certain types of sideslopes. Mature hardwood stands, which were deemed to be of the greatest conservation value, were classified into eight ecological land types based on soil type, aspect, orientation and topographic setting for further study. When these land types were evaluated with respect to data on forest composition and environmental conditions collected in the field, we found that the variables used to derive the eight classes were important in influencing floristic patterns. It was, however, clear that the classes themselves imperfectly captured patterns of overstory community composition for a number of reasons. Thus, while land types provide a potentially valuable management tool, their utility and successful implementation are dependent upon a recognition of their inherent limitations.

This is especially prevalent in the mountainous regions of the western United States where the interaction of two seasonally distinct weather systems can result in locally abrupt climate boundaries. Here we establish oxygen isotope ratios of goethite from ferricrete chronosequences formed by natural acid rock drainage as a new source of spatially small-scale Holocene climate information. Systematic study of these deposits may prove useful in understanding regional variations in response to global Holocene climate change. Oxygen isotope ratios of goethites from the mountainous northeastern Yellowstone region show an increase of ~3\u2030 over the past 9000 years. We attribute this isotopic change to a local increase of isotopically heavier summer precipitation since the early Holocene, possibly augmented by seasonal temperature differences brought on by orbitally forced insolation changes over the past 9000 years. Our interpretation is compatible with palynology studies as well as Holocene climate simulations, which indicate a decrease in monsoon intensity from 9000 years B.P. to the present. Unlike the southwestern United States, this change may have resulted in wetter summers in our study area. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The segments show a range of volcanic and tectonic types, but in general the northernmost segments (i.e. those with greater influence from the Azorean hotspot) are shallower and more volcanically robust than those to the south, with hydrothermal activity in segment centres (for example, Menez Gwen and Lucky Strike). Nonetheless, this generalisation requires some modification due to temporal variations in the balance between magmatic supply and tectonic dismemberment. The NTOs are broad right-stepping discontinuities, locally up to 25 km wide, and accommodate offsets between 10 and 50 km. The discontinuities are mostly sediment-floored, and link the spreading segment tips with a range of structures. These include locally dense arrays of en echelon extensional normal faults, short lengths of linear strike-slip fault strands occasionally cutting basement blocks apparently stranded within the offsets. Basement blocks within the offsets are cross-cut by complexes of intersecting faults, suggesting that deformation is distributed across the zone. The pervasive faulting taking place at the NTOs favours fluid circulation and associated hydrothermal activity, as at the Rainbow Site at 36\u00b017'N. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The research reported here resulted in development of a procedure to integrate the satellite-derived surface biophysical parameters with a boundary layer climate model for simulating spatial surface energy exchange. The procedure was tested through spatial surface energy balance simulation of an urban/rural landscape in eastern Nebraska. The modeled surface temperature and net radiation were compared to those derived from the concurrent satellite data. The errors of the modeled surface temperature were small, and were mainly attributed to uncertainties in the estimation of surface moisture availability and satellite-derived surface radiant temperature. Modeled net radiation was also in agreement with the values calculated from satellite data. Modeled turbulent heat fluxes were in general agreement as compared to those reported in the literature, but the model tended to overestimate the latent heat flux for most rural land cover types. It was concluded that by incorporation of satellite-derived surface physical parameters into a boundary layer model, simulation of spatial land surface climate processes was much improved. The method and procedures developed from this study can be utilized in other boundary layer climate models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The characteristic Nb/Ta ratios of continental crust (ca. 12) and eclogitic oceanic crustal slabs (ca. 33) likely result from element fractionation during slab dehydration. This is because the most efficient mechanism of fractionating the chemical twins Nb and Ta is by chemical complexing in hydrous solutions. The near-chondritic present-day Nb/Ta ratio of the depleted mantle (ca. 17) suggests that similar proportions of Nb and Ta have been recycled from both the continents and oceanic slabs over geological time. Furthermore, the Nb and Ta contents of a worldwide suite of MORB samples are very well-correlated (r2 = 0.996), which shows that the depleted mantle is very well-mixed for high-field-strength elements. Long-term existence of chemically distinct oceanic crust or sediment reservoirs in the depleted mantle is therefore unlikely. This strongly suggests that high Nb/Ta slabs, which are required to balance the low Nb/Ta continental lithosphere, are hidden in the lower mantle. There is no evidence that these deeply subducted slabs are a significant source component of ocean-island basalts. Rather, the chondritic Nb/Ta ratio of the majority of ocean-island basalts suggests that these rocks are derived either from an undepleted portion of the lower mantle, and/or from the depleted mantle.

The surface heat budget was computed over the entire GSL for the 7 ice-free months (May-November incl.) by using SST maps in combination with atmospheric fields and satellite-derived monthly averaged cloud cover data. Monthly means of mixed-layer depth, upper-layer heat content and upper-layer stratification were obtained for 15 sub-regions of the GSL. Simple ID calculations (heat transfer, mixed-layer deepening rates, stratification change rates, heat storage rates) were used to study the seasonal evolution of the upper-layer thermohaline structure.

Measurements were performed at a high confining pressure on a total of 12 representative samples of the Alboran Domain (Internal Betics). P-wave mean velocities, referred to pressure conditions of 280\u00b110 MPa, range from 5.82 to 7.13 km s-1, the maximum values corresponding to high amphibolite facies metapelites (garnet gneiss). Under these pressure conditions, V(p) anisotropies range from 1.2 to 16.1%, with the lowest values being associated with granitic rocks and the highest values associated with metapelites from the upper structural units. P-wave velocities were calculated for prevailing P-T conditions at depths of 10, 20, 30 and 40 km. We discuss the significance of the analyzed rock-types in terms of metamorphic grade and derived V(p) at different crustal/levels. P-wave velocities and densities measured on low-to-middle and middle-to-high grade metamorphic rocks are compatible with values obtained from previous seismic and gravity studies for the upper and middle crust, respectively. At lower crustal levels, the integration of our measurements with other geophysical data suggests the presence of partial melting of high-grade metamorphic rocks. The estimation of the impedance contrast from the measured physical properties suggests that the reflective character of the mid-lower crust is associated with shear/mylonitic zones and/or fine-scale lithological layering enhanced by partial melting.

        "Absrtact": "The timescales of element transfer at volcanic arcs provide important insights into magma generation, movement and storage beneath destructive margin volcanoes. Here we present major, trace and Sr-, Nd- and U-series isotope data on <200 ka old samples from Santorini in the Aegean volcanic arc as a case study of a hazardous destructive margin volcano. Samples range from low-K calc-alkaline basalts to high-K rhyolites, are enriched in light rare earth elements and fluid mobile trace elements, and have negative Ta, Nb and Ti anomalies characteristic of arc magmatism. 87Sr/86Sr ratios range from 0.7035 to 0.7054 and are negatively correlated with 143Nd/144Nd ratios, ranging from 0.51285 to 0.51263. Lavas from the second eruptive cycle (~ 180 ka-~3.6 ka) are in U-Th radioactive equilibrium, and a whole-rock, plagioclase, magnetite U-Th mineral isochron from a 67\u00b19 ka dacite yields an age of 85 (+22/-19) ka (1\u03c3). Samples from the Kameni islands (46 AD-1950) show small but significant uranium excesses, with (238U/232Th) = 0.91-1.04 and (230Th/232Th) = 0.91-0.97, suggesting that the time since U-Th differentiation is \u2264 147 (+27/-21) ky (1\u03c3). A U-Th mineral isochron from the 1940 Kameni dacite yields an age indistinguishable from its eruption age. The Kameni samples show variable Ra depletion, with (226Ra/230Th) = 0.92-0.99. The range in Sr and Nd isotope data reflects progressive crustal assimilation. The combined trace element and isotope data are consistent with a three-component source model involving mantle wedge, sediment melts and slab-derived fluids. While initial 238U-excesses in the second eruptive cycle have decayed, implying slab-derived fluid addition > 180 ky prior to eruption, for the Kameni lavas fluid addition to the wedge is \u2264 150 ky. U-Th mineral isochrons indicate that crystal residence times in the subvolcanic plumbing system are short. Fractional crystallisation less than ~ 1 ky prior to eruption of the Kameni dacites is suggested by (226Ra/230Th) < 1. The combined data imply that timescales of magmatic differentiation in crustal reservoirs are short, that transfer time of the slab-fluid signature through the mantle wedge varies through time.",

        "Absrtact": "High-resolution, three-dimensional, compressional and shear wave velocity models, derived from microearthquake traveltimes, are used to map the distribution of Poisson's ratio and porosity at Coso Geothermal Area, Inyo County, California. Spatial resolution of the three-dimensional Poisson's ratio and porosity distributions is estimated to be 0.5 km horizontally and 0.8 km vertically. Model uncertainties, \u00b11% in the interior and \u00b12.3% around the edge of the model, are estimated by a jackknife method. We use perturbations of r = V(p)/V(s) ratio and \u03a8 = V(p) \u00b7 V(s) product to derive distributions of Poisson's ratio, \u03c3, and porosity, which are then used to constrain and delineate possible zones of intense heat, fracture accumulation and fluid saturation. Poisson's ratio at Coso ranges from 0.15 to 0.35 with an average of 0.224, lower than the crustal average of 0.25. High Poisson's ratios are more extensive in shallower depths (<1.5 km) while lower Poisson's ratios are found in the deeper section (1.5-3.0 km) of the target area. Two major features with low Poisson's ratio are identified at geothermal production depth (1-3 km) around stations S2-S6 and S1-S3-S4. The two low-\u03c3 features are separated by a northwest-southeast-trending high-\u03c3 belt with variable width of 1-3 km. A high-\u03a8 body is found around S2 and S6, and extends down in depth. A circular, low-\u03a8 belt corresponding to the high-\u03c3 belt, is located around S2-S6 and is linked to a previously reported structure in V(s) tomography. This low-\u03a8 (highly porous) belt is probably a horizontal conduit/reservoir of geothermal fluid. A vertical, low-\u03c3 and high-\u03a8 channel beneath triangle S1-S3-S4 corresponds to a high-attenuation, dome-like feature. We propose an upwell-and-spread magma intrusion model for the last major magmatism in the Coso region. The magmatic upwelling is centered in the S1-S3-S4 area. The model predicts potential geothermal resources to the south and west of triangle S1-S3-S4 based on local faulting patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "Global epicentre maps show that the majority of earthquakes are inter-plate, although moderate to large earthquakes do occur intra-plate, i.e. within the plates. The seismicity of the Australian continent is typical of intra-plate environments and a magnitude ML 6 earthquake has an average return period of about 5 years. Recordings of Australian intra-plate earthquakes are investigated here to characterise their frequency content, peak acceleration and duration. Due to lack of quality strong motion records of large intra-plate earthquakes at short distances, synthetic seismograms are commonly used for testing structural behaviour. An empirical Green's Function method (Geophys. Res. Lett. 5 (1978), 1-4: Proceedings of the Third International Microzonation Conference, Seattle, USA. vol. 1. (1982). pp. 447-458.) is chosen to simulate a large earthquake by summation in time of a number of smaller earthquakes or sub-events, each given a slightly different origin time to represent more realistically the propagation of a rupture along an assumed fault plane. In the first instance, recordings on rock of the magnitude ML 2.3 aftershock of the 29 December 1989 Newcastle earthquake were used as sub-events to simulate the main shock of magnitude ML 5.6. Validation studies for events recorded elsewhere in Australia are also considered. The response spectra of such synthetic events will be compared with the recommended spectra developed empirically from a statistical analysis of strong motion data for magnitude 5.4-6.5 intra-plate earthquakes recorded in other parts of the world and normalised to a peak ground velocity of 50 mm/s which is typical for a return period of 500 years in Australia (Australasian Structural Engineering Conference, Auckland. New Zealand. (1998). pp. 439-444.). Preliminary results from this comparison with the response spectra recommended for the Building Code of Australia show that the synthetic waveforms produced by this method are realistic and can be used to represent ground motion during typical Australian intra-plate earthquakes. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This situation arises partly from the fact that soils constitute a continuum, which unlike easily identifiable plants and animals, needs to be placed into classes by convention. In order to remedy this the International Union of Soil Science has been working for the last 20 years with a working group RB, to develop a common language for naming the soils of the world: the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), which was endorsed by the IUSS World Congress at Montpellier in 1998. This paper reflects on the WRB, its objectives, its principles, goals as well as its implementation. Last but not least, projections are made on implications of WRB for soil inventories and small-scale land surveys. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Crystal shape correlates directly with the relative growth rates of the various faces. By studying cases of known structures in which crystal shape varies systematically with some solution parameter (pH, ionic strength, concentration of a specific solute, etc.), it is sometimes possible to correlate that parameter with its effect on a particular crystal contact. Such correlations provide the basis for models of how solution parameters affect protein-protein interactions. We have applied this technique in a model system involving a subtilisin BPN' variant. Crystal shape varies systematically with pH and ionic strength, an effect that has been traced to a specific interaction in one crystal contact. Mutation of an Asp sidechain in this contact (to Asn) eliminates the morphology variation effect, confirming the key role of this residue in the observed shape effect, and enabling the mechanism to be placed in a mathematical framework.",

        "Absrtact": "Atmospheric and oceanic pCO2 were measured continuously along an Atlantic Meridional transect (50\u00b0N-50\u00b0S) in September-October 1995 and 1996 (U.K. to the Falklands Islands) and in April-May 1996 (Falklands Islands to the UK). The Atlantic ocean was a net sink for atmospheric CO2 for all 3 transects. The largest sinks were located at high latitudes, in regions of high wind speed, where strong CO2 undersaturations, associated with high biological activity, were observed. In these regions the partial pressure difference between the ocean and the atmosphere reached -110 \u03bcatm. A CO2 source occurred in the equatorial region between 0\u00b0and 10\u00b0S, where \u0394pCO2 of up to 40 \u03bcatm was found. Another source was in the northern subtropical gyre where its extension varied according to the season. Along the whole transect the October cruises exhibited similar pCO2 distributions suggesting a dominance of the seasonal variability and small year to year changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

We recently reported on the development and preliminary validation of the IBS-QOL, a specific quality-of-life measure for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this study was to determine the longitudinal construct validity (responsiveness) of the IBS-QOL. METHODS: Female patients enrolled in a multicenter treatment trial for functional bowel disorders were studied pre- and posttreatment with the IBS-QOL and other health status measures. Based on the response to treatment for several variables (pain/14- day score, daily function, and days in bed/3 months), patients were stratified into Responders, Partial Responders, and Nonresponders. Change scores in the IBS-QOL were then statistically compared with changes in the other variables to determine their correlation and whether Responders were significantly different from non- and Partial Responders on the IBS-QOL. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between change scores on the IBS-QOL and the other measures of treatment effect (Pain/14 days, r = 0.25, p < 0.002; Sickness Impact Profile [SIP] Total Score, r = 0.28, p < 0.0004). In addition, the IBS-QOL scores significantly differentiated Responders from Nonresponders for most of the variables tested (regression trend test for Pain/14 days, p < 0.04; SIP Total, p < 0.0001; SIP Physical, p < 0.0001; SIP Psychosocial, p < 0.002, and SIP Eating, p < 0.04). CONCLUSION: The IBS-QOL is responsive to treatment in a referral-based clinical population of patients with functional bowel disorders. (C) 2000 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.",

Our first objective was to compare the growth (and body condition) of previously-runt white sturgeon after they recovered from the run state and sturgeon that had never been runts. On 12 occasions, recovered runts and age- and size-matched controls that had never been runts were tagged and put in a tank that already contained fish of similar age and size. Tagged groups were followed for 119-134 days. Median relative growth rates (RGRs) of the recovered runts were significantly (p \u2264 0.05) higher than those of the controls in three tanks. Multiple linear regression was used to model final weight as a function of initial weight and status (recovered runt or control). Status was not significantly related (p = 0.71) to final weight, after adjusting for initial weight, 'tank' and time of follow-up. Our second objective was to determine factors that influenced the loss of tags by white sturgeon during the follow-up period. Logistic regression analysis indicated that higher initial weight and being a control fish might have been associated with losing both tags. We concluded that once white sturgeon runts recovered and started growing, they grew at least as well as fish that had never been runts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A predominance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (subclass pattern B) has been associated with a 2- to threefold increase in coronary heart disease risk. Recently, it has been reported that LDL subclass pattern B is associated with hyperfibrinogenemia, which is also a coronary heart disease risk factor. The present study examined the relation between hyperfibrinogenemia and LDL subclass pattern in 258 postmenopausal women. A significant univariate correlation was observed between the concentration of cholesterol carried in small, dense LDL particles and plasma fibrinogen concentration (r = 0.17, p = 0.01). The prevalence of LDL subclass pattern B was 41.9% in the highest fibrinogen tertile, compared with 27.9% and 24.4% in the first and second tertiles, respectively (global chi-square 6.8, p = 0.03). The crude odds ratio (OR) for LDL subclass pattern B among women in the highest fibrinogen tertile, compared with the lower tertiles, was 2.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 3.51, p = 0.01). After adjustment for age and plasma lipids (log(e) triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and high- density lipoprotein cholesterol), the OR was 2.14 (95% CI 1.17 to 3.96, p = 0.01). Further adjustment for hematocrit, indicators of carbohydrate homeostasis, body mass index, waist circumference, and several variables related to lifestyle did not attenuate this association (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.27 to 5.27, p = 0.01). These data suggest that hyperfibrinogenemia and LDL subclass pattern B may be 2 components of a common syndrome and suggest that hyperfibrinogenemia may contribute to the increased coronary heart disease risk associated with LDL subclass pattern B.

These parameters are of medical significance as they represent metabolic processes (functioning) occurring within each voxel within an imaged region within the body. Each distribution of activity by time is modelled as a mixture of specified (basis) components. The component distributions are those in a large (spectral) class of specified densities, for instance, exponential decay distributions with specified half-life. We describe the integration of maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction from indirect data with mixture modelling of the original time activity, and assess our ability to determine the distribution of this activity, varying in space and time.",

The conventional shift-share analysis is used to measure the impact of shifts in both labour and capital inputs. The results do not support the structural-bonus hypothesis, which states that during industrial development, factor inputs shift to more productive branches. This finding is robust, even when the conventional shift-share analysis is modified to take into account increasing returns to scale as described in Verdoom's law. It is argued that improvements in productivity levels were widespread and depended negatively on the distance from the global technology frontier, confirming the Gerschenkronian notion of catch-up. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Time-varying hedge ratios are generated by a bivariate error correction model with a GARCH error structure. We also introduce an augmented GARCH (GARCH-X) model where the error correction term enters in the specification of the conditional covariance matrix. This specification links the concept of disequilibrium (as proxied by the magnitude of the error correction term) with that of uncertainty (as reflected in the time varying second moments of spot and futures prices). In- and out-of-sample tests reveal that the GARCH-X specification provides greater risk reduction than a simple GARCH and a constant hedge ratio. However, it fails to eliminate the riskiness of the spot position to the extent evidenced in other markets in the literature. This is thought to be the result of the heterogeneous composition of the underlying index. It seems that restructuring the composition of the Baltic Freight Index (BFI) so as to reflect homogeneous shipping routes may increase the hedging effectiveness of the futures contract. This by itself indicates that the imminent introduction of the Baltic Panamax Index (BPI) as the underlying asset of the Baltic International Financial Futures Exchange (BIFFEX) contract is likely to have a beneficial impact on the market.

Currents and densities in the top 1000 m generally improve by over 50 - 70% after 5 months of sea level assimilation every 15 days. Below 1000 m, an error reduction of up to 50% is achieved. The errors remain low during a further 60-day run without assimilation. Diagnostics for the North Atlantic, the Tropical Pacific and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are shown alongside the global averages. The main problems encountered were in weakly stratified regions of the Antarctic and Arctic seas. A scale selective filter is developed to avoid assimilating scales much larger than the local deformation radius, and this avoids the adverse assimilation effects in the southern oceans. A companion paper uses this scheme to assimilate TOPEX and ERS-1 altimeter maps. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Fluxes of carbonate and non-carbonate (terrigenous + biogenic siliceous) sediment, back to a maximum of marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, were determined for 54 cores from off eastern New Zealand. Mass accumulation rates (MARs) were derived using dry bulk densities measured directly from fresh cores or, in the case of dry archived samples, on estimates from a density/carbonate relationship. MARs exhibit wide spatial and temporal variability in response to (i) the location of cores relative to the terrigenous source of New Zealand, current pathways and local oceanographic features, and (ii) palaeoclimatic change. For MIS 1-2, non-carbonate accumulated at a high rate between 27 and 18 ka (calendar years), due to an influx of waterborne and aeolian terrigenous detritus together with localised production of biogenic silica under a northward intrusion of subantarctic waters, and an increase in wind-induced upwelling. By 18-12 ka, non-carbonate MARs reduced as winds ameliorated and sea level rose to confine some of the terrigenous load to the continental shelf. The Holocene transgression was accompanied by warmer sea surface temperatures, the formation of coastal and lacustrine sediment traps, and more widespread terrestrial vegetation. These conditions further reduced the deep oceanic non-carbonate flux to levels about half those of glacial periods. In contrast, carbonate MARs were lower in cold periods, reflecting lower productivity, increased dissolution and, in the case of the generally productive waters of Chatham Rise, to redistribution by bottom currents. However, off central New Zealand, carbonate production was higher on the continental margin, possibly because of enhanced upwelling under the strong wind regime of MIS 2. Such localised effects produced glacial carbonate MARs higher than interglacial MIS 1 values. For the rest of the region, carbonate fluxes increased to an early to middle MIS 1 maximum before generally declining in recent times. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The equitable distribution of resources is paramount to this and measures of disadvantage are implemented to assess differential levels of need as a basis for calculating deprivation payments according to general practitioner workload. Despite research that highlights the benefits of measures of social disadvantage, indices have not been used to fundamentally shape resource allocation for health authorities. This paper uses the results from a patient survey into utilization behaviour to define and model the determinants of the need for health care based on components of relative need and accessibility. Proxy indicators are derived from routine sources of data to create an Index of Relative Disadvantage (IRD). A sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the index and shows that-although the index employs a wider range of variables than most previous deprivation indices-there is no gross data redundancy. Simplified versions of the index are also explored and evaluated. The IRD developed here is closely correlated with other indices of disadvantage, but its greater breadth and more logical construction mean that it may be more likely to be a more widely applicable instrument for health care planning of resource allocation.

Multiple regression analyses indicated that children with the highest \"risks\" (low-quality daycare, chronic otitis media, late entry into daycare) for social or behavioral problems were the most shy and withdrawn with their friends at 7 years of age. Verbal behavior and ability were predicted by quality of care and experience with otitis media. Higher quality daycare was related to higher verbal ability, and chronic otitis media was related to lower verbal ability.

The sapropels are characterized by very high organic carbon contents (up to 30%) which are reported to be the result of both increased productivity and improved preservation. Although the organic matter in the sapropels is mainly of marine origin, the \u03b4 13 C(org) values and C/N ratios appear 'terrestrial'. This is the result of anaerobic organic matter degradation which preferentially removed nitrogen- and 13 C-rich organic components. A comparison with Ti/Al profiles, which mimic the precession index, and a calculation of organic carbon accumulation rates indicate that sedimentation rates were at most 30% lower or at most 50% higher during sapropel formation. Thus, sapropel formation lasted from between 2000 and 10,000 years at Site 964 to between 4500 and 12,000 years at Site 967. A synthesis of new data and a comparison with existing models indicates that productivity, which increased due to extra nutrients supplied as a result of winter mixing and as a result of enhanced input by the Nile, was the driving mechanism behind sapropel formation. The resulting sapropel formation was simultaneous at different depths, but lasted longer in the part of the basin closest to the Nile. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "A comparison of high-MgO magmas from both oceanic and continental settings reveals that they exhibit wide variations in their bulk-rock contents of FeO* (9-16 wt% at 15 wt% MgO). The high-FeO* picrites (ferropicrites) range from Archean to recent in age but are relatively rare at the Earth's surface, typically forming thin isolated flows near the base of thick lava piles in large igneous provinces. They are characterised by high contents of compatible trace elements (e.g. Cr = 400-1650 parts per million (ppm) and Ni = 250-1050 ppm) and unaltered samples (Parana-Etendeka and Madagascar) have relatively smooth, normalised multi-element patterns that lack significant relative enrichments in strongly incompatible elements (e.g. [Ba/La](n) = 0.5-1.0) and [La/Nb](n) = 1.2-1.4). The ferropicrites are distinguished from other picritic rocks (e.g. Deccan, Hawaii, West Greenland) by their relatively low abundances of Al2O3 (~ 10 wt%) and heavy rare-earth elements (HREEs, e.g. Lu = < 10Xchondrite). They have 87Sr/86Sr(i) ratios of ~ 0.7048 and \u03b5(Nd) values of ~ +4 that are comparable to those of ocean-island basalts. Modelling calculations of combined Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios indicate that some of the ferropicrites may have assimilated upper or lower crust but this appears to have had little effect on major element abundances. The high-FeO* contents of world-wide ferropicrites, relative to 'normal' picrites, cannot simply be attributed to variations in degrees of partial melting and/or depth of melt segregation of an anhydrous lherzolite mantle source. Quantitative partition modelling suggests that the contributing parental melts of the ferropicrites were derived by adiabatic decompression melting of a mantle source that was similar in composition to experimentally studied Fe-rich peridotite PHN1611. The parental melts of the Parana-Etendeka ferropicrites appear to have been generated by ~ 10% partial melting, at high pressures (45-35 kbar) and high mantle potential temperatures (T(p) = 1550\u00b0C). The relatively low volume of world-wide ferropicrites and their association with igneous rocks of 'normal' FeO* contents in mantle plume-related igneous provinces suggest that the former may be derived from Fe-rich streaks in mantle plume starting-heads.",

A slightly landward dipping interface revealed at 13 km depth by a single previous line in the channel between Cephalonia and Zante has been suggested as the interplate subduction boundary. New marine multichannel reflection profiles and OBS refraction and wide-angle reflection data confirm the reflector as a regional feature. These data evidence its extension to the south, where large, low-angle thrust earthquakes occur offshore to Zante. The new profiles establish a coincidence between the focal depths of these large subduction events and the imaged bright reflective level, confirming its tentative interpretation as the interplate boundary, which generally appears with a positive reflection polarity. In this context, the Ionian Islands outcrop corresponds to a shallowing of the interplate boundary from south to north. In the south, offshore Zante, the interplate boundary comprises a stratified zone that may be considered as the sedimentary cover of the Ionian Basin oceanic-like crust, which forms the lower plate here. The shallower position and single-cycle reflection character of the interplate further north suggest that the lower plate could there be the Apulian paleomargin to that basin. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two were erupted along the Juan de Fuca ridge at around 46\u00b0N and one along the East Pacific Rise South at around 18\u00b0S. The within-sample dispersion of paleointensity results from the 'Animal Farm' flow (EPR south) is very low and leads to a well-defined mean value of 35.6\u00b1 1 \u03bcT (95\u2030 error on the mean) based on 11 glass chips from four independent samples. Today's geomagnetic field intensity in the area is 31.2 \u03bcT. Comparing Animal Farm results with published field model reference curves developed for the past 400 yr suggests an eruptive date estimated between 1880 A.D. and 1950 A.D. (taking into account different sources of errors). This is consistent with qualitative evidence for the age of this flow and constitutes the first precise demonstration of using paleointensity as a dating tool for very recent mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). However in the Juan de Fuca area results show a more erratic pattern with samples varying by up to 30\u2030 higher and lower from the expected value of about 55\u03bcT. The dispersion is attributed to the large local crustal magnetic anomalies in this area that can lead to inconsistent intensity values over the same unit. Local magnetic anomalies should thus always be checked when doing paleointensity on MORB samples which should also be distributed as widely as possible in a flow unit. When no significant magnetic anomalies are detected the paleointensity dating tool is anticipated to be especially efficient to investigate the volcanic cyclicity along the EPR axis during the last several hundred years. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "Detailed knowledge of the petroleum systems of mature petroleum provinces is often lacking. This has often resulted from the early discovery of most of these provinces' reserves. The South Caspian basin represents one such province. The \"modern\" era of petroleum exploration in the South Caspian began more than 100 years ago. Even with this long history several aspects of the petroleum system have remained largely speculation. Among the key questions are: \u2022 What is the primary hydrocarbon source for the region? \u2022 Where and when has hydrocarbon generation taken place? \u2022 Can exploration be extended beyond known stratigraphic and areal limits? Recent integrated geologic and geochemical studies have attempted to answer these and other questions for the petroleum system of the South Caspian basin. These studies attempted to overcome prior problems associated with limited sample availability, severity of surface weathering, data quality and completeness. This study confirmed the Maykop Suite as the primary oil source, but restricted its stratigraphic distribution. Organic carbon content within the Maykop ranged upward to 14.28 wt.%, with hydrocarbon generation potentials (S2) approaching 75 mg HC/g rock. Source rock deposition was cyclic and included both oil- and gas-prone episodes. Geochemically, the region's oils are highly variable as a result of their complex and variable migration and alteration histories rather than their derivation from multiple source rock units. The oils display similar molecular and isotopic compositions to the extracted Maykop samples confirming their genetic relationship. The range in carbon isotope values reflects secular changes within the Maykop Suite source. Unlike some earlier studies, this study showed that all of the oils were generated within the conventional \"oil-window\" (R0 = 0.9-1.0%). This places the source system at depths in excess of 5 km and emphasizes the role that vertical migration played in the development of the basin's hydrocarbon accumulations. There is evidence that migration was episodic, possibly related to punctuated generation or the opening of conduits through the activity of mud diapirs. Model results also suggest that the rapid Plio-Pleistocene subsidence and sedimentation were the primary controls on hydrocarbon generation.",

        "Absrtact": "Can the slowdown in total factor productivity (TFP) that we have experienced since the mid-seventies be ascribed to the increasing importance of services, or do we instead observe an improvement of productivity in the service sectors by way of learning-by-doing or specialization? We feel that such questions are best answered within a general equilibrium analysis of the whole economy, i.e. a structural view of the whole economy. We maximize the level of domestic consumption subject to commodity balances and endowment constraints. The Lagrange multipliers associated with the endowment constraints measure the marginal productivities of labor and capital. We declare these shadow prices to the factor productivities. The main empirical contribution of this paper is a reexamination of the services paradox. In Canada, the sluggish productivity in services is limited to finance, insurance and real estate, and to business and personal services. Any attempt to resolve the services paradox may focus on these two sectors. Transportation, trade, and to a lesser extent communication are progressive sectors. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "A GIS algorithm has been applied to analyse the maximum potential extent that lava flows can reach in order to delimit the areas topographically protected against flow invasion. The algorithm selected makes use of a special kind of spatial analysis functions called neighbourhood operators, in which the outcome depends on the values that one or more specified variables adopt in the surroundings of the element where analysis takes place. Assuming the maximum magnitude hypothesis, potential lava flow invasion areas can be calculated with spatial analysis functions in the context of two propagation regimes: persistent flow lengthening, and a combination of persistent flow lengthening and widening. To define the algorithm behaviour for each regime, a series of simple stochastic rules have been set to establish the way in which lava flow propagation can proceed. The algorithm has been applied on three source areas located in Tenerife Island characterised by their high probability of occurrence of basic effusive events. For each area, maximum potential flow extent has been calculated following both propagation regimes, with the aim of delimiting the areas that would potentially remain out of lava reach. No distance limits have been taken into account to carry out the calculation, as lava has on many occasions reached the coastline either in historic or geologic times. An additional hazard exposure level analysis has been possible in those areas where results indicated that flows could potentially arrive from more than one source. Algorithm performance assessment has been carried out in terms of accuracy by generating a series of 3D views and comparing the algorithm application results with those obtained from stochastic physical model simulation. Although the GIS algorithm applied does not distinguish the probability level of an area being invaded by lava, it has clearly identified on Tenerife the areas which are potentially safe from the flows that could originate at any point located inside or on the margins of each of the source areas considered. This capability can be advantageously used to develop medium-to long-term risk prevention and management measures. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "To study the diving activity of harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) from nursing to independent feeding, we VHF radio tagged and tracked seven pups. The pups gradually developed the diving skills necessary to obtain enough food after weaning and to avoid natural and man-made dangers. The maximum dive duration remained unchanged with pup age, indicating that pups have considerable breath-holding capacity already from an early age. However, mean dive duration increased with age, from 0.92 min in pups \u226425 days old to 2.55 min in 1-2 month olds, and 3.09 min in 2-3 month olds. The increase continued for weeks after the assumed weaning, and indicates that the capacity to perform long-lasting dives steadily increases as the pups grow older. Mean and maximum surface duration remained unchanged with pup age. Mean surface duration was 0.32 min with a maximum value of 6.10 min. An increase in mean surface duration with mean dive duration was found when the pups were \u226425 days old, but not when they were older. This may indicate that young pups need to rest more after diving than older ones. No relationship was found between dive duration and the subsequent surface interval. The proportion of time spent submerged increased with age, from 71% when the pups were \u226425 days old to 86% when they were older. The pups hauled-out less frequently as they grew older. The pups were never recorded outside the study area (defined by the 30-km station range). Time of day, tidal height and weather conditions seemed not to influence the diving behaviour of the pups. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Mineral isochron dating is a frequently used geochronological tool. One of its assumptions is that the minerals grow over a time period that is small compared to the half-life of the radiogenic isotope system used. In recent years, increasing analytical precision has promoted the use of the short-lived U-series isotope system in order to date young crystallisation events. Three whole-rock zircon U-Th isochrons from the 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, yield pre-eruptive model ages of 5.5 \u00b1 0.8 ka, 9.7 \u00b1 1.7 ka and 12.3 \u00b1 0.8 ka for the sub-63 \u03bcm. 63-125 \u03bcm and 125-250 \u03bcm zircon size fractions, respectively. This suggests that in this case the assumption of instantaneous crystal growth breaks down. Instead, the U-Th data may be explained by continuous zircon growth over a period of e190 ka. However, cathodoluminescence shows that crystals are typically composed of an euhedral core surrounded by a sector-zoned euhedral rim, and the U-Th data can also be modelled by mixing an older (\u039f27 ka model age) population of zircon crystals with a young zircon rim that formed shortly prior to eruption of the Oruanui rhyolite. This indicates that detailed petrographic studies are critical for deciphering the histories of prolonged crystallisation in the magmatic environment. It is concluded that conventional U-series mineral isochrons may underestimate the age of the onset of crystallisation by more than an order of magnitude. In future, microanalytical techniques will lead to significant advances in the understanding of crystallisation processes and timescales. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

BACKGROUND: Staged revision of the native heart and transplantation as treatments for HLHS have been compared in treatment-received analyses, which can bias results. METHODS: Data on 231 infants with HLHS, born between 1989 and 1994 and intended for surgery, were collected from four pediatric cardiac surgical centers. Status at last contact for survival analysis and mortality at one year for risk factor analysis were the outcome measures. RESULTS: Survival curves showed improved survival for patients intended for transplantation over patients intended for staged surgery. One-year survival was 61% for transplantation and 42% for staged surgery (p < 0.01); five-year survival was 55% and 38%, respectively (p < 0.01). Survival curves adjusted for preoperative differences were also significantly different (p < 0.001). Waiting-list mortality accounted for 63% of first-year deaths in the transplantation group. Mortality with stage 1 surgery accounted for 86% of that strategy's first-year mortality. Birth weight <3 kg (odds ratio [OR] 2.4), highest creatinine \u22652 mg/dL (OR 4.7), restrictive atrial septal defect (OR 2.7) and, in staged surgery, atresia of one (OR 4.2) or both (OR 11.0) left-sided valves produced a higher risk for one-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation produced significantly higher survival at all ages up to seven years. Patients with atresia of one or both valves do poorly in staged surgery and have significantly higher survival with transplantation. This information may be useful in directing patients to the better strategy for them. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.",

The peak of SPICE (+ 5%0) coincided with a time of maximum regression in Laurentia. SPICE is similar in this regard to excursions that coincide with glacio-eustatic falls, such as in the Late Ordovician. A plausible scenario involves the transformation of ocean circulation between two states, which led to enhanced coastal upwelling and benthic extinctions. The lack of evidence for glaciation indicates that the coeval sea level fall (Sauk II-Sauk III event) resulted from tectonic or hydrologic changes that remain poorly understood at this time.

Precipitation in Korean waters showed a decadal scale climatic jump, especially of Ullungdo Island, reflecting the regime shift that occurred in the North Pacific. The variation was also detected in East Asian atmospheric systems. The Aleutian Low and North Pacific High Pressure Systems showed substantial changes in 1976 and around 1987-89. 1976 was an unusually warm year for Korea; mean sea surface temperature (SST) was higher than 'normal' and was accompanied by a northward shift in the thermal front. Post 1976, the volume transport of the Kuroshio Current increased and higher seawater and air temperatures persisted until 1988. Other shifts occurred after 1976 such as an increase in mixed layer depth (MLD) and biological changes in the ecosystem of Korean waters including decreases in spring primary production and an increase in autumn primary production. Primary production increased again after 1988, and was followed by a significant increase in zooplankton biomass after 1991. The 1976 regime shift was manifested by a decreased biomass and production of saury, but an increase in biomass and production of sardine and filefish in Korean waters. After 1988, recruitment, biomass, and production of sardine collapsed while those of mackerel substantially increased. Based on these observations, hypotheses on the relationship between the climate-driven oceanic changes and changes in fisheries resources were developed and are discussed. \u00a9 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "Groundwater table (GWT) class maps have been mapped for the whole of The Netherlands at a scale of 1:50,000, and provide useful information for a variety of purposes. Due to strong human impact on the Dutch landscape, water tables have changed and the maps now need updating. Six updating methods have been defined, varying in data requirements and in the smallest spatial unit that can be updated. The performance and cost of each of the methods were measured in a 9228-ha test area. The costs were also extrapolated to larger areas of 46,994 and 75,684 ha using measures of sampling error as criteria. The major cost factor is largely determined by the sample size, which is method dependent. A method that updates GWT maps by evaluating an objective function in locations obtained through stratified random sampling showed the best performance in the test area and a reasonable cost development at larger areas. Validation in the 75,684 ha area supported this conclusion. A kriging-based method performed well, but was expensive. In the near future, elevation data will be available at the national scale. Using these data as ancillary information will decrease cost and increase the accuracy of GWT map updates. This will allow for drawing new map polygons instead of re-labeling existing ones.

Individual-drug resistance was examined using isolates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus spp. as Gram-negative and Gram-positive indicator organisms, respectively. The annual prevalence of resistance was calculated for each organism to each of nine (for E. coli) and 11 (for Staphylococcus spp.) selected antimicrobials. The annual prevalence of multiple-drug resistance (MDR) was calculated for E. coli, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., staphylococci and streptococci. Using a chi-square test for trend, significant rising trends were identified in individual resistance of E. coli to clavulanate-amoxycillin and streptomycin, and in MDR of E. coli, Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Declining trends were identified in individual resistance of Staphylococcus spp. to ampicillin and penicillin. Comparison with previously reported results from a contemporaneous investigation of companion-animal hospital patients indicated that selection pressures acting on the two populations overlapped but were not identical.

        "Absrtact": "In contrast to the situation for genotoxic carcinogens, few in vitro tests exist that can detect early markers of the events thought to be associated with non-genotoxic carcinogenesis. Also, comparatively little is known about the quantitative structure-activity relationships (Q)SARs of these agents. This review discusses published SAR studies conducted on non-genotoxic carcinogens, in relation to the use of several markers of in vitro cell toxicity (inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communication, inhibition of tubulin polymerization, modulation of apoptosis and induction of cell proliferation), which are used as endpoints for screening this class of carcinogen. Much of the work has involved the identification of new biophores (substructural features of molecules associated with toxicity), as well as other structural features, which are thought to predispose the chemicals to ligand binding with specific target molecules acting as possible receptors (e.g. protein kinase C, the oestrogen, peroxisome-proliferator and tubulin protein receptors), implicated in the mechanism of toxicity involved. It is concluded that (a) there is an urgent need for more information on (Q)SARs for non-genotoxic carcinogens; (b) this information should be acquired by using several different approaches in a variety of laboratories; and (c) such research should proceed together with more studies on the mechanisms of cell toxicity caused by these chemicals, including the identification and characterisation of further specific receptors involved in mediating the various types of cell toxicity associated with this type of carcinogenesis.

        "Absrtact": "A grazing experiment with young cattle was conducted over two consecutive (1997, 1998) grazing seasons on semi-natural pasturelands in central-eastern Sweden. Comparisons were made between groups of animals that were either untreated and set-stocked, ivermectin bolus treated and set-stocked or untreated but moved in mid-summer (mid-July) to ungrazed pasture. The whole experimental area had remained virtually free of cattle during the previous two seasons and the cattle had been raised indoors since birth. To introduce low-levels of parasite infection into the experimental system, each animal received a 'priming dose' of approximately 10,000 infective trichostrongylid larvae at the time of turnout for both years. Results of the first year study showed that the level of parasitism was so low that it failed to induce any productivity losses in both groups of untreated cattle, which grew as well as those given boluses at turnout. In contrast, in 1998 both groups of untreated cattle suffered varying degrees of sub-clinical and clinical parasitism to result in an average of 30kg liveweight depression, compared with the bolus treated cattle, at the end of the season. The only major departure between the two years was that in the latter, the cattle in the untreated groups were exposed to infective larval pickup, which had overwintered on pasture. Cattle in the move treatment grazed in the same sequence on pastures used by similar classes of animals during the previous year. That is, their pastures at turnout had not been grazed since mid-summer of the previous year. Clearly this early season (1997) grazing by young cattle resulted in sufficient overwintered larvae at the start of the following year (1998) to cause productivity losses of the same magnitude as those recorded for young cattle grazing on pastures contaminated for the entire grazing season of the previous year. This was confirmed by tracer tests that were carried out on all treatments, at the time of turnout and the mid-summer move in 1999. These results have major significance to organic cattle producers in Sweden who have a much higher tendency to practice a variety of grazing management techniques aimed at controlling nematode parasite infections in young cattle, than their conventional farming colleagues. It has been identified that one of these strategies is to simply use summer/autumn saved pastures for young stock at turnout, which if grazed by young stock prior to this, could prove to be counter-productive.

        "Absrtact": "Purpose: Currently, optimally precise delivery of intracranial radiotherapy is possible with stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. We report on an optimally precise optically guided system for three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy using multiple noncoplanar fixed fields.Methods and Materials: The optically guided system detects infrared light emitting diodes (IRLEDs) attached to a custom bite plate linked to the patient's maxillary dentition. The IRLEDs are monitored by a commercially available stereo camera system, which is interfaced to a personal computer. An IRLED reference is established with the patient at the selected stereotactic isocenter, and the computer reports the patient's current position based on the location of the IRLEDs relative to this reference position. Using this readout from the computer, the patient may be dialed directly to the desired position in stereotactic space. The patient is localized on the first day and a reference file is established for 5 different couch positions. The patient's image data are then imported into a commercial convolution-based 3D radiotherapy planning system. The previously established isocenter and couch positions are then used as a template upon which to design a conformal 3D plan with maximum beam separation.Results: The use of the optically guided system in conjunction with noncoplanar radiotherapy treatment planning using fixed fields allows the generation of highly conformal treatment plans that exhibit a high degree of dose homogeneity and a steep dose gradient. To date, this approach has been used to treat 28 patients.Conclusion: Because IRLED technology improves the accuracy of patient localization relative to the linac isocenter and allows real-time monitoring of patient position, one can choose treatment-field margins that only account for beam penumbra and image resolution without adding margin to account for larger and poorly defined setup uncertainty. This approach enhances the normal tissue sparing, high degree of conformality, and homogeneity characteristics possible with 3D conformal radiotherapy. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

Background. In hemiplegia, an equinovarus positioning of the foot might be caused by an increased stiffness of the m. triceps surae. Methods. In eight hemiplegic patients the net joint torque of passive muscle stretch was measured as a function of ankle-angle by a dynamometer, at both sides. Ankle-stiffness was characterised and also a biomechanical model of the passive muscle was fitted. Results. In the vast majority of measurements it was possible to obtain measurements that were not distorted by involuntary muscle contraction. These measurements showed for the angle at which a passive plantar moment of 10 N m was reached a standard error of measurement of less than 2.7\u00b0. The muscle model showed the increased stiffness as a shortening of the muscle-fibre-length. Conclusion. The feasibility of this method to measure muscle stiffness was fair to good in hemiplegic patients. Provided the abandoning of involuntary muscle activity, the reproducibility warrants application in clinical practice at an individual level. The use of the model relates this changes to a shortened m. soleus and/or m. gastrocnemius. Relevance: Effective clinical decisions for treatment of equinovarus positioning of the foot in the hemiplegic individual, should consider excessive involuntary contractions of the m. triceps surae complex (i.e., spasticity), as well as shortened muscle tissue resulting in high stiffness. Despite the importance of increased stiffness there have been no validated methods of measurement.

Materials and Methods: A prospective, population based survey was conducted on 3,690 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between October 1, 1994 and October 31, 1995. Cases were identified by the rapid case ascertainment systems used in 6 geographic regions participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Based on information captured in primary medical record reviews we estimated the positive yield of bone scans, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The positive yield of bone scan and CT was less than 5% and 12%, respectively, for all men with prostate specific antigen (PSA) 4 to 20 ng./ml., and less than 2% and 9%, respectively, for those who also had a Gleason score of 6 or less. Only men with PSA greater than 50 ng./ml. and those with Gleason scores 8 to 10 and PSA greater than 20 ng./ml. had positive yields greater than 10% and 20% for bone scan and CT, respectively. Conclusions: Imaging studies designed to identify metastases and/or extracapsular extension in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer frequently have a low positive yield. Wide variations exist in the use of imaging studies and are associated with tumor factors, such as Gleason score and serum PSA, and nontumor factors, such as state of residence. More extensive cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to define appropriate guidelines for ordering imaging studies to optimize the positive yield among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.",

Gaining knowledge about the genome of these parasites is of importance for the understanding of their biology, mechanisms of drug resistance and antigenic variation that determine escape from the host's immune system. This review will provide an update on the Schistosoma Gene Discovery Program, which is part of the Schistosoma Genome Project created in 1992. One of the main objectives of this program is the discovery and characterisation of new genes of Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum in an attempt to search for new targets for drugs and vaccine development. The success of the Schistosoma Gene Discovery Program is demonstrated by the number of catalogued genes, that now reaches 15 to 20% of the full gene complement of its genome.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1995 (DSHEA) expanded the definition of dietary supplements beyond essential nutrients while distinguishing them from drugs or food additives. In order to give practical advice to consumers and policymakers, dietetics professionals need to understand the implications resulting from this less-restrictive regulatory environment for supplements. Dietetics professionals must also become familiar with claims made by manufacturers, retailers, and others regarding popular nonvitamin, nonmineral (NVNM) supplements, as well as usage prevalence and trends. However, NVNM supplements currently are classified inconsistently, and information on the prevalence of use is limited. Sales data suggest that total intake is increasing, and garlic and ginseng are consistently among the most popular supplements. Reported use of NVNM supplements in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was highest for garlic and lecithin. The data suggest associations of NVNM supplement use with age and more healthful lifestyles; however, there is also a reported link with higher alcohol consumption and obesity. Associations with education, income, region, and urbanization are not evident from the sales data. Standardized survey procedures regarding question phraseology, referent time period, and supplement categorization - along with use of representative samples - will improve our ability to assess supplement use, prevalence, and trends.",

        "Absrtact": "Alterations in VO2 or VCO2 are amongst the more polemical physiological adaptations ascribed to insects. Generally, metabolic rate is thought to be lowered in response to arid conditions, and elevated in species from cold environments compared to their more temperate relatives. However, most studies have rarely addressed the influence of both environmental factors in unison. To this end, standard metabolic rate and its temperature dependence were measured (at 4\u00b0C intervals from 16 to 32\u00b0C) in six Scarabaeus dung beetle species (three flightless, three volant) from a variety of habitats (warm, arid to cool, mesic) in southern Africa using flow-through respirometry. Mass specific VCO2 varied from 0.0158 ml g-1 h-1 at 16\u00b0C to 0.1839 ml g-1 h-1 at 32\u00b0C. The slopes of the rate temperature curves were similar for all species (Q10S of 2.14-2.84), although the intercepts differed significantly in the direction (warm arid to cool mesic): S. gariepinus<S. hippocrates<S. striatum<S. galenus<S. rusticus<S. westwoodi. General linear models were fitted to the VCO2 data with treatment, wing status, mean annual rainfall and mean annual temperature as the independent variables. For all six species, the best fit model included treatment temperature and wing status only. Flightless species had significantly lower VCO2S than did winged ones. Amongst the flightless species, S. gariepinus, from the driest area, had the lowest VCO2. Among the winged species it was impossible to determine whether environmental temperature or water availability were most important in influencing VCO2; both were significant. We conclude that investigations of metabolic rate modulation, and especially metabolic cold adaptation, in insects must take both temperature and water availability into account.

        "Absrtact": "Data for uranium concentrations in 29 rivers and eight estuaries are presented. The fiver data expands the existing database on riverine uranium transport to include more smaller watersheds which collectively account for a large portion of material transport from the continent to the oceans. Riverine concentrations for these smaller watershed range from less than 50 to 660 pM. The results for these systems, when combined with previously published data on mostly larger rivers, do not change significantly the calculated global riverine flux and thus earlier estimates by Palmer and Edmond [Palmer, M.R., Edmond, J.M., 1993. Uranium in river water. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 57, pp. 4947-4955] are substantiated. Uranium transport through eight diverse estuaries was studied to assess the importance of estuarine removal in the global marine uranium budget. Results indicate that uranium is conservatively transported in most systems studied. Results reported here for the Savannah estuary, however, indicate significant uranium removal. Our results suggest that uranium is removed in salt marsh estuaries at a rate of ca. 70 \u03bcmol/m2. This compares to a rate of 15 \u03bcmol/m2 for Delaware salt marshes [Church, T.M., Sarin, M.M., Fleisher, M.Q., Ferchlman, T.G., 1996. Salt marshes: an important sink for dissolved uranium. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 60, pp. 3879-3887]. We suggest that uranium removal to salt marsh sediments is due to anaerobic microbially mediated processes. We use these results to estimate the global significance of the salt marsh sink in the oceanic budget of uranium. We estimate that 2.7 x 107 mol of uranium are removed to salt marshes annually as compared to an annual global riverine input of 3-6 x 107 mol estimated by Palmer and Edmond [Palmer, M.R., Edmond, J.M., 1993.

Viable counts were obtained for lactococci, lactobacilli, leuconostoc, enterococci, yeasts, Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci; analyses of volatiles were performed by chromatography after solid-phase micro-extraction. Treatment of all analytical data produced by principal component analysis revealed correlations between the major microbial groups present in cheese and patterns of volatiles generated. End products resulting from the degradation of sugars, free amino acids and glycerides constituted the predominant volatiles of Serra da Estrela cheeses. Among volatile, short-chain carboxylic acids detected were acetic, propionic, iso-butyric and iso-valeric acids; these compounds are known to be breakdown products of Gly, Ala and Ser, of Thr, of Val, and of Ile, respectively, following oxidative deamination. Semi-volatile fatty acids and their corresponding ethyl esters appeared in the cheese, probably as a result of the activity of lipases produced by yeasts and Enterobacteriaceae. These ethyl esters, which are responsible for fruity flavours, were especially pronounced in cheeses manufactured from refrigerated milk. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "In combinatorial synthesis, molecules are assembled by linking chemically similar fragments. Because the number of available chemical fragments often greatly exceeds the number that can be used in one synthetic experiment, one needs a rational method for choosing a subset of desirable fragments. If a combinatorial library is to be targeted against a particular biological activity, virtual screening methods can be used to predict which molecules in a virtual library are most likely to be active. When the number of possible molecules in a virtual library is very large, genetic algorithms (GAs) or simulated annealing can be used to quickly find high-scoring molecules by sampling a small subset of the total combinatorial space. We previously demonstrated how a GA can be used to select a subset of fragments for a combinatorial library, and we used topology-based methods of scoring, Here we extend that earlier work in three ways. (I) We demonstrate use of the GA with 3D scoring methods developed in our laboratory. (2) We show that the approach of assembling libraries from fragments in high-scoring molecules is a reasonable one. (3) We compare results from a library-based GA to those from a molecule-based GA. \u00a9 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.",

BeppoSAX offers broad-band spectroscopy in the 0.1-100 keV band with in addition imaging spectroscopy (arcminute resolution) in the 0.1-10 keV band. The high sensitivity and well-behaved point-spread function at high energies allows a study of the spatial distribution of both the iron K\u03b1 (6.7keV) and K\u03b2 (8keV) complex. In the Perseus cluster the observed K\u03b2/K\u03b1 ratio is significantly higher than that predicted by standard thermal emission codes. This ratio decreases significantly outwards, providing evidence for resonance scattering of the iron K\u03b1 line. Taking this into account the iron abundance in the core of the Perseus cluster is nearly twice as large as previously thought. In A 2199 there is evidence for a hard non-thermal tail in the spectrum. Spatially resolved spectroscopy with the MECS instrument shows spectral hardening in the outer parts of the cluster. Moreover the simultaneously taken PDS spectrum of this cluster shows a tail extending up to at least 50 keV. Apart from the high-energy spectral component, the LECS data also show evidence for excess emission at large radii. The soft excess was also detected by the DS instrument of EUVE. This together is very suggestive for the presence of inverse Compton emission in A 2199. Recent EUVE and BeppoSAX observations of the Coma cluster also support the presence of strong non-thermal emission, in addition to the thermal component. We shorthly discuss a few consequences of these new results for the dynamics of clusters. \u00a9 2000 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

        "Absrtact": "The distribution of surficial sediments and sediment dispersion patterns on the steep continental slope off Nice (SE France) have been studied using side-scan sonar, 3.5 kHz profiles, short piston cores and bottom photographs. The input of terrigenous material to the Baie des Anges, a submarine embayment bounded by two prominent ridges, is dominated by fluvial input from the Var River, the Paillon River being only a minor source. The Var River provides very coarse bedload material (gravel and cobble) directly to the head of the Var Canyon. Gravel and cobble deposits are found along the Var Canyon and the Upper Fan Valley of the Var submarine fan and have been shaped into gravel waves. The fine particles (suspension load) are separated from the coarse bedload upon entering the sea and form up to 60-m thick deposits on the uppermost continental slope of the Baie des Anges. These deposits are formed by settling out of sediment plumes. The presence of silt and fine sand laminae that decrease in thickness and frequency away from the Var River mouth indicate the influence of meso- and hyperpycnal flows on these plume deposits. Areas outside the Baie des Anges are not connected to major fluvial input and receive only hemipelagic sediments. These primary deposits are highly unstable and sediment failure due to seismic loading, sedimentary loading or undercutting is frequent. Sediment failure produces secondary sediment gravity flows that export most of the material to the basin, but also produce turbidity-current over-spill deposits on ridges bounding the slope canyons and on terraces within the Var Canyon. Slump and debris-flow deposits are also observed. At least some of these secondary flows erode the continental slope as cross-cutting chutes on the upper continental slope and erosional scours in the Upper Fan Valley demonstrate. Modem sediment dispersal patterns on the continental slope off Nice are proposed as a modem analogue to lowstand conditions on continental margins. In fact, the absence of a continental shelf together with a steep slope strongly reduces the influence of sealevel on the physiography of the margin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

It is generally accepted that both the location and the magmatic products of the volcano are genetically linked to Ross Sea rifting and uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) rift shoulder. Studies on pyroclastic falls suggest that an eruption likely occurred in the last few centuries. Presently the volcano has a low level of activity which has been highlighted and monitored by means of integrated geophysical networks. After a review of previous geophysical and geological findings at both regional and at a more local scale, in our study we display and interpret newly compiled magnetic and gravity images over the Mount Melbourne area to better constrain the tectonic framework of the region. We propose that the structural setting is dominated by major NWSE right-lateral strike-slip faults generating uplifted crustal blocks, namely the Deep Freeze Range block and more subsided N-S graben-like structures such as the one in which Mount Melbourne volcano itself appears to be located. Local seismic events could well be associated with the N-S faults within this graben. Gravity data is consistent with crustal thickening beneath the TAM and offshore it highlights together with heat flow data and seismic constraints a NNE trending pull-apart basin with extended crust also linked to the strike-slip tectonics of the region. Local gravity anomalies are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Data for 24 OECD countries on GDP, employment, and investment from the Penn World Tables over the period 1950 to 1990 was used. Five sources are used for educational data. The descriptive statistics suggest that the convergence in labor productivity levels among these nations appears to correspond to their convergence in schooling levels. However, econometric results showing a positive and significant effect of formal education on productivity growth among OECD countries are spotty at best. With only one or two exceptions, educational levels, the growth in educational attainment, and interaction effects between schooling and R&D were not found to be significant determinants of country labor productivity growth. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Absrtact": "An integrated field experiment was organized as part of the EC EXAMINE project to quantify surface-atmosphere fluxes of ammonia (NH3). Fluxes of NH3, NH4+ aerosol, HNO3 and HCl were measured using the gradient method with several continuous and batch sampling systems. Within-canopy NH3 was determined to quantify the contribution of leaf cuticles, sub-stomatal apoplastic (intercellular) fluids and other sources and sinks to net fluxes. The campaign included the first field measurements of apoplastic pH and [NH4+], providing independent estimates of the stomatal compensation point (\u03c7(s)) for comparison with micrometeorological results. The latter also compared fluxes before and after cutting. Under the clean conditions of the experiment, [NH3][HNO3] and [NH3][HCl] were much less than values required for aerosol formation, while the NH4+ aerosol size distribution indicated that aerosol evaporation would be much slower than the time-scale of turbulent exchange. Nevertheless, the measurements suggest that aerosol production/growth as well as formation of HCl may have occurred within the canopy. Apoplastic [NH4+] and pH of leaves showed no diurnal patterns, with the main control on \u03c7(s) being the temperature dependence of the solubility equilibria. Fluxes of NH3 were bi-directional (-200 to 620 ng m-2 s-1), with deposition generally occurring when the canopy was wet and emission when it was dry, particularly during the day. Nocturnal emissions indicated a non-stomatal NH3 source, while daytime emissions were larger than indicated by the apoplastic estimates of \u03c7(s). The within-canopy data, together with an inverse Lagrangian source-sink analysis, showed decomposing litter to be a significant NH3 source, explaining nocturnal NH3 emissions and larger emissions following cutting. Daytime net fluxes were controlled by the top part of the canopy, due to \u03c7(s) for siliques apparently being larger than for leaves. The measurements have been used to develop multi-layer resistance models of NH3 exchange. A 3-layer 'foliage-littersilique model' provides a detailed mechanistic treatment of the component fluxes, while a 2-layer 'foliage-litter model' is better suited to generalization in atmospheric transport models. Application of the new models should help improve estimates of regional atmospheric ammonia budgets. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "Lowermost Silurian organic-rich ('hot') shales are the origin of 80-90% of Palaeozoic sourced hydrocarbons in North Africa and also played a major role in petroleum generation on the Arabian Peninsula. In most cases, the shales were deposited directly above upper Ordovician (peri-) glacial sandstones during the initial early Silurian transgression that was a result of the melting of the late Ordovician icecap. Deposition of the main organic-rich shale unit in the North African/Arabian region was restricted to the earliest Silurian Rhuddanian stage (acuminatus, atavus and probably early cyphus graptolite biozones). During this short period (1-2 m.y.), a favourable combination of factors existed which led to the development of exceptionally strong oxygen-deficiency in the area. In most countries of the study area, the post-Rhuddanian Silurian shales are organically lean and have not contributed to petroleum generation. The distribution and thickness of the basal Silurian 'hot' shales have been mapped in detail for the whole North African region, using logs from some 300 exploration wells in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. In addition, all relevant, accessible published and unpublished surface and subsurface data of the lower Silurian shales in North Africa and Arabia have been reviewed, including sedimentological, biostratigraphic and organic geochemical data. The lowermost Silurian hot shales of northern Gondwana are laterally discontinuous and their distribution and thickness were controlled by the early Silurian palaeorelief which was shaped mainly by glacial processes of the late Ordovician ice age and by Pan-African and Infracambrian compressional and extensional tectonism. The thickest and areally most extensive basal Silurian organic-rich shales in North Africa occur in Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya, while on the Arabian Peninsula they are most prolific in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Iraq. The hot shales were not deposited in Egypt, which was a large palaeohigh at that time. The depositional model presented may help in better understanding the source potential of the basal Silurian shales in less-explored regions of North Africa and Arabia including Morocco, northern Niger and the Kufra Basin in southeast Libya.

        "Absrtact": "The Paleozoic-Mesozoic Jameson Land Basin (East Greenland) is intruded by a sill complex and by a swarm of ESE trending dykes. Together with dykes of the inner Scoresby Sund fjord, they form a regional Early Tertiary intrusive complex located ~ 200-400 km inland of the East Greenland rifted continental margin. Most of the intrusive rocks in the Jameson Land Basin are geochemically coherent and consist of evolved plagioclase-augite-olivine saturated, uncontaminated high-Ti basalt with 48.5-50.2 wt.% SiO2, 2.2-3.2 wt.% TiO2, 5.1-7.4 wt.% MgO, 9-17 ppm Nb and La/Yb(N) = 2.8-3.6. Minor tholeiitic rock types are: (a) low-Ti basalt (~ 49.7 wt.% SiO2, ~ 1.7 wt.% TiO2, ~ 6.8 wt.% MgO, ~ 2.6 ppm Nb and La/Yb(N) = ~ 0.5) akin to oceanic basalts; (b) very-high-Ti basalt (~48.6 wt.% SiO2, ~ 4.1 wt.% TiO2, ~ 5.1 wt.% MgO and ~ 21 ppm Nb); and (c) plagioclase ultraphyric basalt. The tholeiitic dolerites are cut by alkali basalt (43.7-47.3 wt.% SiO2, 4.1-5.1 wt.% TiO2, 4.9-6.2 wt.% MgO, 29-46 ppm Nb and La/Yb(N) = 16-17) sills and dykes. Modelling of high-field-strength and rare-earth elements indicate that the high-Ti basalts formed from ~ 6-10% melting of approximately equal proportions of garnet- and spinel-bearing mantle of slightly depleted composition beneath thick continental lithosphere. Conversely, dolerite intrusions and flood basalts of similar compositional kindred from adjacent but more rift-proximal occurrences in Northeast Greenland formed from shallower melting of dominantly spinel-bearing mantle beneath extended and thinned continental lithosphere. These variations in lithospheric thickness suggest the continent-ocean transition of the East Greenland rifted volcanic margin is sharp and narrow. 40Ar-39Ar dating and paleomagnetism show that the high-Ti dolerites were emplaced at ~ 53-52 Ma (most likely during C23r) and hence surprisingly postdate the main flood volcanism by ~ 2-5 Ma and the inception of seafloor spreading between Greenland and Europe by ~ 1-2 Ma. The formation of tholeiitic and alkaline magmas emplaced into the Jameson Land Basin corroborates to the importance of post-breakup magmatism along the East Greenland volcanic rifted margin. Upwelling of the ancestral Iceland mantle plume under central Greenland at 53-52 Ma (rather than under the active rift), perhaps accompanied by a failed attempt to shift the rift zone westward towards the plume axis, may have triggered post-breakup continental magmatism of the Jameson Land Basin and the inner Scoresby Sund region, along preexisting structural lineaments.

Pb isotope ratios are calculated relative to 206Pb and are normalised in a run to an arbitrary 208Pb/206Pb ratio to permit good estimates of error propagation through the fractionation correction. While 204Pb/206Pb normalised to 208Pb/206Pb appears free from interferences and obeys power- or exponential-law mass fractionation within analytical error. 207Pb/206Pb shows systematic decreases with increase in 208Pb/206Pb at > 1250\u00b0C that are extremely difficult to explain by isobaric interference and may indicate abnormal mass fractionation behaviour. However, this behaviour is absent from plasma-source mass spectrometers. Correction for the effect improves external reproducibility of SRM981 from 96 to 82 ppm (1 sd. 33 analyses over 1 year) for 206Pb/204Pb, and from 64 to 43 ppm for 207Pb/206Pb. For 206Pb/204Pb, this external reproducibility is only about twice the typical internal error on a single analysis after error propagation through the fractionation correction. Relative to the fractionation-corrected isotope ratios, measured ratios for unknown samples analysed are significantly more enriched in the lighter isotopes than are runs of SRM981, indicating that corrections based on average SRM981 mass fractionation are likely to be in error. Acid-leached rock chips and acid-leached powders generally give identical Pb ratios within analytical error. However, re-analysis of samples previously published by several laboratories shows large differences, up to 30 X the supposed reproducibility of conventional Pb isotope determinations, probably related both to inadequate fractionation corrections and to environmental contamination of rock powder.",

        "Absrtact": "The Lamongan volcanic field (LVF) in East Java, Indonesia, consists of up to 61 basaltic cinder or spatter cones, a minimum of 29 prehistoric maars, and a central compound complex comprising three main vents including the historically active Lamongan volcano. The field lies on the Sunda volcanic arc and abuts onto the currently active Tengger caldera-Semeru complex to the west. Between 1799 and 1898, Lamongan was persistently active and discharged up to 15 lava flows of basaltic to basaltic andesite composition, which is probably more than what was erupted by any other Indonesian volcano in that period. Several seismic crises have been recorded in the LVF since Lamongan's last eruption. There are no existing records of cinder cone or maar-forming eruptions in the area. Despite the possible hazards posed by future activity in the LVF, the history and structure of the field have been subject to little scrutiny. This contribution presents the results of a detailed morphometric and volumetric investigation of prehistoric vents and historic lava flows in the LVF, using field data, historic records, satellite imagery and modelling of erupted volumes. A typical LVF maar is characterised as a crater with a diameter of 450 m; generated by an eruption with a model ejecta volume of 0.016 km3 dense rock equivalent (DRE) and a model juvenile component volume of 0.0096 km3 DRE. Diameter/depth ratios of some maars display a morphological freshness comparable to recently formed phreatomagmatic eruption craters elsewhere. The median LVF cinder/spatter cone has a basal diameter of 600 m, a height of 75 m, a volume of 0.009 km3 and a model total erupted volume of 0.014 km3. Variation in cone basal diameter to height ratios indicates that the age of some prehistoric cones may not exceed a few centuries, and morphological classification identifies the youngest prehistoric vents on the northern flanks of the central edifice. Historic activity from vents on the western flanks of Lamongan produced at least ~0.05 km3 of basaltic to basaltic andesite lava. Resurfacing rates at Lamongan in the 19th Century imply an age of ~ 900-2100 years for the surface of the volcano. The steady-state eruptive rate from 1843-1898 is evaluated as 0.025 m3 s-1, which is low in comparison to estimates from many presently active systems. Using eruptive rate and volume data, the age of the LVF is estimated as between 13 and 40 ka, placing it among the youngest dated Indonesian volcanoes. Complex regional tectonics in conjunction with magmatic pressure have probably been the major influences on the distribution of volcanism in the LVF. The occurrence of maar-forming eruptions may have been controlled by a porous substrate, possibly a deposit from the Holocene Iyang-Argapura complex to the east. Volcanic hazards from future eruptions in the LVF include base surges, ash flows, ashfall and ejected blocks associated with phreatomagmatic activity, and ashfall and ejecta from magmatic eruptions.

        "Absrtact": "Purpose: Alcohol use is commonly present in sexual assault incidents, but the nature of its role in these offenses remains unclear. Researchers have argued that the propensity to abuse alcohol generally and the use of alcohol prior to assault by offenders and victims may be associated with increased severity of sexual abuse and physical injury to sexual assault victims. In particular, there is speculation that offender drinking may facilitate offenders' use of greater physical aggression against victims in their attacks, resulting in more serious injuries to victims. Methods: The role of alcohol in sexual assault incidents (n=163) identified from a national sample of women was studied. Results: In the present sample, offender pre-assault drinking and offender aggression used in the offense were each strong predictors of victim physical injury. Victim heavy episodic drinking did not predict victim injury controlling for other assault characteristics, victim and offender drinking prior to assault, and victim demographic characteristics. Drinking by offenders and victims was more common in assaults where victims were less well acquainted with their assailants prior to attack. Higher levels of offender aggression and victim injury were also associated with stranger attacks. Implications: Implications of the results for the study of alcohol and sexual assault are discussed.",

The results proved that the above mentioned parameters varied significantly within the investigated length of the plume (approximately 2 km). It is shown how the small single primary particles aggregate and change the in situ particle size spectra into a slightly better sorted and coarser size distribution, and at the same time how the mean density of particles/aggregates decreases significantly. This shift in the state in which the particles exist in the water effectively changes the optical response of the mass of particles suspended in the water. It is shown that adequate correlations between mass concentrations and beam attenuation coefficients can only be obtained if parameters describing the in situ quality and state of the mass of particles, e.g. standard deviation of the size spectra and volume concentration, is included in the regression. From the spatial variation in mean density and in situ particle size, it was possible to calculate the spatial difference in settling velocity. It was found that the difference in settling velocity was only about a factor of 1.7, because increasing in situ particle size was counter-balanced by decreasing mean density.

        "Absrtact": "In burial environments, carbonate sediments undergo mineralogical stabilization and increasing lithification with depth. As yet, however, little knowledge exists with respect to the corresponding effects on fossil preservation and taphonomic modification of the original sediment composition. Countings of particles (>63 \u03bcm) in Miocene to Recent periplatform sediments (ODP Leg 133, NE Australia) exhibit a clear trend of reduction of skeletal aragonite downcore. Low- and high-Mg-calcite grains occur in a continuous order of magnitude over the studied interval (<600 m sub-bottom depth). Original microtextures are retained in high-Mg-calcite biota, although converted to low-Mg-calcite. Thus, the conversion to low-Mg-calcite appears to occur without introducing a significant quantitative bias. Aragonite skeletons (pelagic gastropods), however, exhibit a successive exposure of deeper crystal layers and a chalky preservation with burial depth, which we interpret to result from dissolution. Hints for the originally more numerous existence of aragonite biota exist in soft sediments and chalks by the presence of internal moulds, shells replaced by microspar, and mouldic porosity in early cemented hardgrounds. In deep sections barren of aragonite, the number of casts and replaced shells remains unchanged and is insignificant as compared to aragonitic biota probably originally present within the sediment (<2% in ooze/chalk vs. 30-50% of grains in modern periplatform sediments). Therefore, palaeontological information must be significantly biased through selective removal of aragonite. Rates of preservation and destruction depend on external factors during sediment accretion (sedimentation rates, clay content, total organic carbon content) and rates of fluid flow within the sediment. These observations are relevant with respect to the diagenetic potential and patterns of fossil preservation in little cemented calcitic cool-water carbonates, because they may originally have contained more aragonite biota as important constituents of an ecosystem than is commonly suspected, and calcite/aragonite ratios in ancient carbonate sediments may not necessarily reflect original input signals (climate or sea level).

Full depth Total CO2 (TCO2) sections are presented for austral autumn and winter (1992) cruises. Pronounced fCO2 gradients were observed at the Southern Ocean fronts. In the Weddell Gyre, fCO2 regimes appeared to coincide with surface and subsurface hydrographic regimes. The southern ACC was supersaturated with respect to CO2, as was part of the northern Weddell Gyre. The southern Weddell Gyre was markedly undersaturated. The great potential of autumn cooling for generating undersaturation and CO2 uptake from the atmosphere was demonstrated. In the northeastern Weddell Gyre, upwelling of CO2- and salt-rich deep water was shown to play a role as the horizontal fCO2 distribution closely resembled that of the surface salinity. The total uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the Weddell Gyre in autumn (45 days) was calculated to be 7 \u00b7 1012 g C. The deep TCO2 distribution noticeably reflected the different water masses in the region. A new deep TCO2 maximum was detected in the ACC, which apparently characterizes the boundary between the equatorward flowing Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). East of the Weddell Gyre, the AABW stratum is much thicker (>2000 m) than more to the west, on the prime meridian (<300 m). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The main objective was to interpret recent, natural and human-induced influences upon the accumulation-erosion balance and the sedimentary environment from Holocene sediment units. The five main units are: consolidated glaciomarine clay (Facies gC) lowermost, consolidated estuarine clay (Facies dC), soft sub-recent sediment (Facies omC and Facies C) uppermost and dumped sediment (Facies D) in some parts of the study area. The sediment facies are divided by two major hiatuses: (a) the early Holocene hiatus between Facies gC and dC involves a time gap of at least 7000 years, ending at ca. 4000 BP and (b) the late Holocene hiatus between the consolidated clays (Facies gC and dC) and Facies omC spans 1000 years and ends ca. 50 BP (i.e. 100 years ago). Both hiatuses probably relate to the effects of isostatic land uplift. Surface sediments consist mainly of an organic-matter-rich clay facies, suggesting changes in the trophic state of the estuary during the last 100 years. Together with human-induced increased river erosion and loss of accommodation space in the estuary, this caused the onset of sedimentation in the estuary. The recent sediments are contaminated with heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Hg), with highest concentrations in the lower part of Facies omC. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The quasi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, for example, can be integrated with the fully distributed groundwater model MODFLOW, to achieve much smaller input data requirements with readily available data. Watershed hetererogeneities can be handled statistically by using the hydrologic response unit concept. Flexibility in handling stream-aquifer interactions, distributed well withdrawals, and multiple land uses becomes much greater.

        "Absrtact": "North Pacific Tropical Water (NPTW) is characterized as a subsurface salinity maximum flowing in the North Equatorial Current and is the main source of salt for the North Pacific. We briefly describe the climatological features of its formation and circulation, and then examine temporal changes in its properties associated with the climate regime shift in the 1970s. We use a variety of data, which include the repeat hydrographic sections along 130\u00b0E, 137\u00b0E, 144\u00b0E and 155\u00b0E meridians, the hydrographic data from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series, the World Ocean Atlas 1994, and available gridded data of wind stress and evaporation. The classical idea that NPTW originates from the zone of the highest sea surface salinity at 20\u00b0-30\u00b0N centered around the international date line and spreads along the isopycnal geostrophic flow patterns is confirmed. Further, it is shown that the meridional extent of NPTW along 137\u00b0E is from 10\u00b0N to 23\u00b0N on average and the highest salinity core lies at about 15\u00b0N and 24.0\u03c3(\u03b8), and that the portion of NPTW north (south) of about 15\u00b0N originates from the formation region west (east) of the date line. NPTW in the 137\u00b0E section changed remarkably associated with the mid-1970s regime shift. North of 15\u00b0N NPTW increased both in its salinity and thickness while to the south of 15\u00b0N only its salinity increased and its thickness remained unchanged. The westward geostrophic velocity is increased significantly in both the southern and northern parts of NPTW. The northern thickening and speedup and the southern speedup increased NPTW transport across 137\u00b0E. The changes in the thermohaline forcing such as evaporation and Ekman salt convergence in the NPTW formation region possibly contributed to the increases in salinity in the southern part of NPTW, but not to that of the northern part, On the other hand, the increased Ekman pumping accounts for the increase of the NPTW inventory and transport at 137\u00b0E. The increased salinity of NPTW at 137\u00b0E, especially its northern portion, was presumably caused by an increase in its formation rate rather than changes in the sea surface salinity in its formation region; the thicker the NPTW layer is, the saltier is the core that tends to survive the mixing processes.

We show that viral escape is due to a 50 to 100-fold reduction in the level of affinity between the P14 TCR and the binary complexes of the MHC molecule with the different peptides. Structurally, one of the mutations alters a TCR contact residue, while the effect of the other on the binding of the TCR must be indirect through structural rearrangements. The former is a null ligand, while the latter still leads to some central tolerance. This work defines the structural and energetic threshold for viral escape. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Previous reports demonstrated that data from air- and spaceborne sensors are appropriate for delineation of soil patterns. Also, many attempts have been made to use digital elevation model (DEM) for deriving soil information. However, little is known about the potential use of low spatial resolution satellite and digital elevation data in small-scale soil mapping. A case study was conducted to assess the use of integrated terrain and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) databases for small-scale soil pattern delineation. The main objective was to test the effect of the addition of terrain descriptor data to the AVHRR data set on the classification results. Two database were used for the study. The first one was purely AVHRR data and contained the five basic AVHRR channels and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of five different dates, while in the second database the AVHRR data was complemented with a DEM, a curvature, a slope, an aspect and the potential drainage density layers. The performance of these two databases when employed to derive soil information was compared. These databases were then further processed using the Discriminant Analysis Feature Extraction (DAFE) function (which is based on a canonical analysis procedure), and were then classified using the Fisher linear discriminant, and the ECHO spectral-spatial classifiers. Based on the results, it was concluded that the two reflective bands, the middle infrared, the two thermal bands and the NDVI provided a relatively wide range of detectable soil information. The use of single images or small dimensional AVHRR data sets (less then 10 layers) does not result in acceptable performances, while the use of multispectral and multitemporal databases improved the classification performance very significantly. However, the purely AVHRR-based model could not always delineate soil variations related to terrain differences, and resulted in an overall classification performance of 49.1%. Digital elevation and terrain descriptor data were essential in the model for achieving acceptable results. In the second part of the study an integrated AVHRR-terrain database was used, where five terrain layers were added to the 30 AVHRR channels. Two different spatial resolutions were compared, 500 m and 1 km, respectively. The use of elevation, slope, aspect and curvature as differentiating criteria often lead to a satisfactory result in terrain characterization, particularly in large-scale mapping. However, with those variables extracted from DEM of physiographically complex areas, e.g., - where plain areas and mountainous/hilly regions occur together in the same study - often lose their ability to delineate soil variations of the level lands. Beyond these terrain descriptors we implemented a new function, called potential drainage density (PDD) to improve the performance of the model on the plain areas. The classification accuracy of the integrated AVHRR-terrain database was improved significantly over the case when only AVHRR data was in the model. The classification performances of the three different resolution images were 87.3% for the 500-m resolution image and 70.1% for the 1-km resolution image. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The estimation algorithms were first tested independently, and then combined, resulting in a combined algorithm for estimating both radiation and humidity that relies only on temperature and precipitation inputs. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for joint radiation and humidity estimates were 2.52 MJ m-2 per day and 85.6 Pa, respectively, close to values reported for the algorithm development studies. Biases were low: +0.02 MJ m-2 per day and +28.2 Pa for radiation and humidity, respectively. Initial results showed biases in estimated radiation related to horizon obstruction and snowpack. We amended the original algorithm, successfully eliminating these effects. Annual prediction MAE was weakly correlated with elevation, and annual bias was not correlated with elevation. Analysis of seasonal patterns in error-elevation relationships showed several periods with significant trends. Radiation MAE was slightly higher in mid-summer for higher elevations, and radiation biases were in general closer to zero throughout the spring and summer at higher elevations. Humidity estimates showed an increased MAE and positive bias at higher elevations in winter. We concluded that the effect of different temperature lapse rates for daily maximum and minimum temperature on the relationship between diurnal temperature range and atmospheric transmittance does not seriously impair predictions over steep elevation gradients in complex terrain.

        "Absrtact": "Seismic velocity discontinuities are commonly found within the upper 100 km of the mantle lithosphere, with great variability in their depth, lateral extent, and the polarity of velocity jump. Among the more commonly observed is the '80 km' or Hales discontinuity, identified in a variety of tectonic environments, and sometimes associated with seismic anisotropy. Teleseismic receiver functions for Global Seismographic Network station RAYN on the eastern edge of the Arabian Shield contain a strong converted-phase P(H)s that we believe arises from the Hales discontinuity at the depth of 70 km. On the basis of the polarization, azimuthal behavior and frequency dependence of P(H)s, we characterize the Hales discontinuity as marking an upper boundary of a zone of depth-dependent anisotropy within the upper mantle. The RAYN receiver functions indicate a similar zone at the crust-mantle transition at 40 km. Forward modeling in simple one-dimensional anisotropic models indicates that the receiver functions require, assuming hexagonal anisotropy, an inclined symmetry-axis with N-S strike. In our preferred model there are two anisotropic zones bounded, respectively, by the sharp Moho and the Hales discontinuities on the top. Smooth gradients of anisotropic properties extend beneath the discontinuities. Within both zones the anisotropic symmetry axes, indicative of systematic fabric in the olivine-dominated upper mantle material, are oriented along the N-S direction (\u00b110\u00b0), and are tilted from the vertical 50\u00b0toward the south. We propose that these regions of coherent fabric within the upper mantle represent shear zones developed during late Proterozoic continent-continent collision, when the Ar-Rayn tectonic block underwent northward 'escape' along the northern flank of the Najd fault system.

        "Absrtact": "Deamination of cytosine to uracil is one of the major pro-mutagenic events in DNA, causing G:C \u2192 A:T transition mutations if not repaired before replication. Repair of uracil-DNA is achieved in a base-excision pathway initiated by a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) enzyme of which four families have so far been identified. Family-1 enzymes are active against uracil in ssDNA and dsDNA, and recognise uracil explicitly in an extrahelical conformation via a combination of protein and bound-water interactions. Extrahelical recognition requires an efficient process of substrate location by 'base-sampling' probably by hopping or gliding along the DNA. Family-2 enzymes are mismatch specific and explicitly recognise the widowed guanine on the complementary strand rather than the extrahelical scissile pyrimidine. This allows a broader specificity so that some Family-2 enzymes can excise uracil and 3,N4-ethenocytosine from mismatches with guanine. Although structures are not yet available for Family-3 (SMUG) and Family-4 enzymes, sequence analysis suggests similar overall folds, and identifies common active site motifs but with a surprising lack of conservation of catalytic residues between members of the super-family.

        "Absrtact": "In order to better constrain the extent to which common sulfide minerals will retain their osmium isotopic composition subsequent to crystallization, we have conducted experiments to quantify the diffusion behavior of osmium in pyrite and pyrrhotite. Experiments consisted of either (1) isothermal soaking of diffusion couples consisting of natural pyrite or pyrrhotite crystals packed against powdered Os-bearing Fe-sulfide or (2) 'relaxation' of initially high near-surface osmium concentrations produced in the latter experiments (pyrite only). Osmium penetration into samples was characterized by depth profiling using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) (pyrite) or electron microprobe analyses across sectioned run products (pyrrhotite). Results of the first type of diffusion experiment involving pyrite show only limited osmium penetration into sample surfaces, with the extent of penetration uncorrelated with run duration. Images of pyrite samples using atomic force microscopy show roughening of initially smooth surfaces as a consequence of step formation and suggest that osmium incorporation into the near-surface occurred by solute uptake during step growth and not by volume diffusion. Prolonged (1000+ h) 'relaxation' experiments revealed no additional osmium penetration into pyrite surfaces and based on the depth resolution for RBS, a maximum diffusion coefficient of 2.5X10-23 m2/s at 500\u00b0C was calculated. Experiments involving pyrrhotite over the temperature range of 950-1100\u00b0C showed extensive osmium uptake and osmium concentration gradients that conform with Fickian diffusion behavior. We found that pyrrhotite Fe/S could be varied by changes in the composition of the starting material and osmium source and over the range of Fe/S produced in experiments (molar Fe/S = 0.83-0.90), we observed no systematic variation in the osmium diffusion coefficient. Diffusion coefficients measured parallel to the a crystallographic axis were on average ~ 1.4X higher than values measured parallel to c and regression of the c-axis data yielded the Arrhenius relation: The application of these diffusion data to simple models of diffusive exchange during static or polythermal time-temperature histories is used to assess the conditions under which radiogenic osmium will be retained. During isothermal annealing, calculations indicate that the cores of millimeter-sized spherical pyrrhotite crystals undergoing diffusive exchange with an external osmium reservoir will have their initial compositions perturbed in \u2264 0.5 Ma at temperatures exceeding 400\u00b0C. Pyrite undergoing the same process at 500\u00b0C requires in excess of 10 Ma before crystal cores are affected. The relatively short 'core retention' time-scales for pyrrhotite indicates that this mineral may be prone to isotopic resetting following relatively brief crustal thermal events, thus possibly accounting for the scatter that commonly occurs in Re-Os isochrons generated from massive sulfide samples. Calculated closure temperatures (T(c)) for osmium exchange in pyrrhotite yielded values of 300-400\u00b0C for grain sizes ranging from 10 to 1000 \u03bcm. These values of T(c) are similar to those calculated for Ar retention in biotite, and considerably lower than for Sr in apatite and plagioclase, for example. Such low closure temperatures for pyrrhotite suggest this mineral will date the final stage in the cooling of a magmatic system and possibly be susceptible to open system osmium exchange in the presence of late-stage hydrothermal fluids. This latter result infers that caution be applied when interpreting elevated initial osmium isotopic ratios as a product of crustal assimilation at the magmatic stage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Relevant factors describing possible changes in the soil include: soil mass, nutrients, weeds and weed seeds, pathogens, nutrients, salts, pH, organic matter, and soil texture and structure. Many of the factors can be included by modelling the effects of infrequent activities benefitting the crop(s) under analysis.

        "Absrtact": "In this study, we examine the relationship between owner and business characteristics and business survival. Our findings are based upon analyses of the Census Bureau's 1982 and 1987 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) survey data on a sample of white male and female sole proprietors. Two aspects of this study distinguish it from any related studies to date. First, we separately examine issues affecting the survival prospects of female-owned businesses, whereas previous studies have focussed solely on businesses owned by men. Second, we use data on cohorts of businesses started or acquired in two different time periods, namely 1980-1982 and 1985-1987. Overall, the mean survival rates of male-owned businesses in these two cohorts are 4- to 6% higher, respectively, that those of businesses owned by women. We hypothesize that wage employment provides opportunities for men and women to acquire the financial and human capital necessary for success in business ownership. In fact, most male and female business owners had some prior spell of employment in the wage sector. But there are gender differences in the status of wage workers that, we further hypothesize, could differentially impact the survival prospects of men's and women's new business ventures. First, women's lower average wage earnings may imply more binding financial constraints on the initial scale of women's businesses relative to men's. Second, we find that female owners in both cohorts are less likely than their male counterparts to have had any prior managerial experience or to have 10 or more years of general, prior paid employment experience, which may imply that female entrepreneurs are more constrained in the amount and quality of human capital that they acquire during wage employment. Female entrepreneurs' access to debt and equity capital has not been overlooked by policy makers. What has been largely overlooked are possible gender differences in the amount and quality of human capital of new entrepreneurs. Women's fewer years of general work experience and lesser exposure to managerial occupations may indicate a role for remedial education or mentoring of would-be female entrepreneurs. Women in both cohorts tended to use less financial capital to start or acquire their businesses than men did, and for the 1982 cohort, business survival is found to be positively related to the amount of start-up capital, other factors held constant. The survival prospects of both male- and female-owned businesses are greater for owners with 10 or more years of prior work experience and/or 4 or more years of college. So at least in terms of education and quantity of work experience, female entrepreneurs are at something of a disadvantage relative to their male counterparts. We find that prior managerial experience has no systematic positive or negative effects on the survival prospects of either men's or women's new business ventures, however. Finally, our research indicates that issues concerning business formation and survival must be considered within the context of prevailing macroeconomic conditions. For example, we find that the survival rates of both male- and female-owned businesses started in the 1985-1987 time period were considerably higher than those of businesses started in 1980-1982. Moreover, we uncover systematic differences in owner and business characteristics between our 1982 and 1987 cohorts, as well as differences in how these characteristics influence business survival. Specifically, both male and female owners in our 1982 cohort were better educated, were more likely to have had prior, paid managerial experience, and had more years of prior, paid employment experience, in general. Researchers interested in assessing the survival prospects of businesses over a given time period must consider changes in both product and labor markets over that period. Strength of demand in product markets will have an obvious, direct effect on business viability. The tightening and loosening of labor markets imply changes in potential wage earnings (an opportunity cost of being self-employed) and in this way can affect business dissolution.",

The X-ray structure was solved at 2.6 \u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement. Aside from differences in some loops, the folding of the enzyme is very similar to the large subunit of the quinoprotein methanol dehydro-genases from Methylobacterium extorquens or Methylophilus W3A1. Eight W-shaped [3-sheet motifs are arranged circularly in a propeller-like fashion forming a disk-shaped superbarrel. No electron density for a small subunit like that in methanol dehydrogenase could be found. The prosthetic group is located in the centre of the superbarrel and is coordinated to a calcium ion. Most amino acid residues found in close contact with the prosthetic group pyrroloquinoline quinone and the Ca2+ are conserved between the quinoprotein ethanol dehydrogenase structure and that of the methanol dehydrogenases. The main differences in the active-site region are a bulky tryptophan residue in the activeCsite cavity of methanol dehydrogenase, which is replaced by a phenylalanine and a leucine side-chain in the ethanol dehydrogenase structure and a leucine residue right above the pyrrolquinoline quinone group in methanol dehydrogenase which is replaced by a tryptophan side-chain. Both amino acid exchanges appear to have an important influence, causing different substrate specificities of these otherwise very similar enzymes. In addition to the Ca2+ in the active-site cavity found also in methanol dehydrogenase, ethanol dehydrogenase contains a second Ca2+-binding site at the N terminus, which contributes to the stability of the native enzyme.

        "Absrtact": "Major and trace element and radiogenic isotope ratios (Sr, Nd and Pb) are presented for a suite of Neogene to Recent basalts (MgO > 4 wt%) from the axial regions of the Kenya Rift. Samples have compositions ranging from hypersthenenormative basalt through alkali basalt to basanite and are a subset of a larger database in which compositions extend to nephelinite. A broadly negative correlation between Zr/Nb (<2-7) and Ce/Y (1-8) indicates derivation from a garnet-bearing mantle source region as a result of <3% melting. Isotope ratios in basalts from the axial regions of the Kenya Rift have 143Nd/144Nd=0.51300 to 0.51255, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7030 to 0.7055 and 206Pb/204Pb <18 to >20, broadly similar to values from OIB. The Kenya Rift cuts through basement of different ages and aspects of the composition of mafic magmas reflect the anisotropy of the underlying lithosphere. Specifically, those basalts from that part of the rift underlain by the Tanzanian craton (TC) have higher Ce/Y and lower Zr/Nb ratios than those erupted through the Panafrican Mozambique belt (MB) implying an origin either at greater depth or from a more trace element-enriched source region. Samples erupted through the zone of reactivated craton margin (RCM) share the characteristics of mafic lavas from both the craton and the mobile belt. MB samples have 143Nd/144Nd = 0.5130-0.5127, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7030-0.7035 and 206Pb/204Pb = 18.3-19.8, defining a steep negative trend on the Nd-Sr diagram and plotting close to the NHRL on conventional Pb isotope diagrams. By contrast TC and RCM samples have 143Nd/144Nd = 0.5124-0.51275, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7035-0.7056 and 206Pb/204Pb = 17.6-21.2, defining flat-lying arrays on Nd-Sr plots and a much greater scatter and spread on Pb isotope diagrams, with many analyses plotting above the NHRL. Both groups of analyses trend towards a common end member on a plot of 143Nd/144Nd against 87Sr/86Sr, at 143Nd/144Nd ~ 0.51275 and 87Sr/86Sr ~ 0.7035. These values are suggested to reflect the isotopic characteristics of the sub-lithospheric Kenyan mantle, inferred to be the Kenya mantle plume. Comparison with data from Afar suggest that the Kenya plume is distinct from the Afar plume, implying that the east African Rift is underlain by at least two distinct mantle plumes. Eocene and Oligocene basalts from southern Ethiopia bear a closer resemblance to the Kenyan basalts than to those from Afar and the Ethiopian plateau, suggesting that the Kenya plume has been active for at least 45 Ma. Migration of magmatism from southern Ethiopia southwards is consistent with the northeastward migration of the African plate over the Kenya plume over the past 50 My. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sequence search techniques are used to infer functional and structural information from similarities to experimentally characterized genes or proteins. The persistent goal is to refine these techniques and to develop alternative and complementary methods to increase the range of reliable inference. Here, we focus on the structural and functional assignments that can be inferred from the known three-dimensional structures of proteins. The study uses all structures in the Protein Data Bank that were known by the end of 1997. The protein structures released in 1998 were then characterized in terms of functional and structural similarity to the previously known structures, yielding an estimate of the maximum amount of information on novel protein sequences that can be obtained from inference techniques. The 147 globular proteins corresponding to 196 domains released in 1998 have no clear sequence similarity to previously known structures. However, 75% of the domains have extensive structure similarity to previously known folds, and most importantly, in two out of three cases similarity in structure coincides with related function. In view of this analysis, full utilization of existing structure data bases would provide information for many new targets even if the relationship is not accessible from sequence information alone. Currently, the most sophisticated techniques detect of the order of one-third of these relationships. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

        "Absrtact": "Background: It has been suggested that a primary ultradian (80-120 minute) rhythm disturbance in EEG underlies sleep abnormalities in adults with depression. The present study evaluated ultradian rhythm disturbances in childhood and adolescent depression. Methods: Sleep macroarchitecture and temporal coherence in quantitative EEG rhythms were investigated in 50 medication-free outpatients with major depression (25 children and 25 adolescents) and 15 healthy normal controls (5 children and 10 adolescents). Results: Few of the macroarchitectural measures showed significant group effects. In fact, age and sex effects were stronger than disease-dependent components. Temporal coherence of EEG rhythms during sleep did differentiate those with MDD from controls. Both depressed children and adolescents had lower intrahemispheric coherence, whereas interhemispheric was only lower in depressed adolescents in comparison with controls. Gender differences were evident in adolescents, but not children, with MDD with lowest interhemispheric coherence in adolescent girls. Conclusions: These findings are in keeping with increased risk for depression in females beginning at adolescence and extending throughout adulthood. It was suggested that low temporal coherence in depression reflects a disruption in the fundamental basic rest-activity cycle of arousal and organization in the brain that is strongly influenced by gender.

As a result of a major excavation of the entrance channel to Pensacola Bay, over 7 million m3 of beach-quality sand were placed long the easternmost 7.5 km of Perdido Key, adjoining the entrance channel at Pensacola Pass. The project included the placement of 4.1 million m3 of sand directly upon the shoreline in 1989-1990, followed by the placement of an additional 3 million m3 as an underwater berm just offshore of the beach nourishment project in water depths of roughly 6 m. Monitoring of the performance of the beach nourishment project and the offshore berm has been conducted since 1989, beginning with a pre-construction survey of the project area. Monitoring surveys have been conducted on an annual or biennial basis since that time, with the most recent survey occurring in July/August, 1998. Over 8 years of monitoring data indicate that the beach nourishment project has retained approximately 56% of the original volume placed within the 7.5-km project length. In addition, according to the latest monitoring survey, the dry beach width of the project, initially constructed as 135 m on average, is still 53 m wider than pre-project conditions. Approximately 41% of the originally placed dry planform area remains as of July 1998. The most recent monitoring surveys in 1995, 1997, and 1998 encompass the effects of two major storm systems, Hurricanes Erin (August 1995) and Opal (October 1995). Monitoring of the offshore berm area indicates only a slight landward migration of the berm, accompanied by a minor decrease in volume, over the entire monitoring period. The performance of both the beach nourishment project and the offshore berm appear to be significantly related to the two storm events, particularly Hurricane Opal, and the proximity of the project to the tidal entrance at Pensacola Pass.

The reconstruction of the \u039b(1520) resonance relies strongly on the particle identification capabilities of the barrel Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector and on the ionisation loss measurement of the TPC. Inclusive production spectra are measured for both particles. The production rates are measured to be <N\u2211-/Nzhad> s 0.081 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b1 0.010, <N\u039b(1520)/Nzhad> = 0.029 \u00b1 0.005 \u00b1 0.005. The production rate of the \u039b(1520) suggests that a large fraction of the stable baryons descend from orbitally excited baryonic states.

This amphibole coexists with chlorite, epidote, muscovite, albite, quartz and hematite, and is composed of Al-rich core and Al-poor mantle. The core is fairly homogeneous and has a barroisitic composition. In the mantle part, ([B])Na increases with decreasing ([4])Al towards the margins, which have winchite-magnesioriebeckite compositions. The barroisite-winchite-magnesioriebeckite composite crystal is sometimes rimmed by actinolite and/or winchite with low ([4])Al and ([B])Na. The Al-rich core and Al-poor mantle are regarded as prograde and retrograde products, respectively. The retrograde mantle in the Saruta-gawa area: (1) is systematically richer in ([B])Na [0.40-1.73 per formula unit (pfu; for O = 23)] than that from the same grade zone in the Asemi-gawa area (0.19-0.78 pfu), about 8 km south of the studied area; (2) tends to be ([B])Na-poorer (less than 1.73 pfu) than prograde sodic amphibole (up to 1.93 ([B])Na pfu) produced in the peak temperature stage from the lower grade zone in the same and other areas; and (3) extends its compositional range towards higher ([B])Na and lower ([4])Al than prograde-formed amphibole from the same grade zone in the same area. These zonal characteristics imply that (1) the Saruta-gawa samples experienced retrograde metamorphism under higher P/T conditions than the Asemi-gawa samples, (2) the retrograde P-T path of the Saruta-gawa area passes on the lower pressure side of the metamorphic field gradient, and (3) the Saruta-gawa samples underwent retrograde metamorphism under higher P/T conditions than the prograde metamorphism. The higher P/T conditions of the retrograde metamorphism suggests an increasing dP/dT of the geotherm during exhumation. Retrograde P-T conditions during the formation of magnesioriebeckite can be roughly estimated at 7-8 kbar, 400-450\u00b0C based on semi-quantitative phase relations of actinolite-winchite-magnesioriebeckite-barroisite series associated with chlorite, epidote, muscovite, albite, quartz and hematite.

This paper focuses principally on the biological record and describes recent research that aims to reconstruct (i) past variability in effective moisture, and (ii) past variability in temperature. Changes in effective moisture are manifested especially by changes in lake water level. In closed lake basins water level change can cause significant changes in water salinity that is registered in sediments by changes in the composition of fossil assemblages, especially diatoms. In open (freshwater) lake basins changes in water level are best reconstructed from the aquatic macrofossil record and potentially from the ratio of open water to littoral species of Cladocera, ostracods and diatoms. The most promising biological method for reconstructing past temperature is chironomid analysis, and a range of new chironomid-temperature transfer functions are being developed. However, biological responses to changing temperature are usually indirect as a result of temperature effects on water-column stratification, nutrient cycling and alkalinity generation, and in most cases a correct interpretation of the climatic significance of changes in the fossil record requires an understanding of the processes that are operating in the water column. A multi-proxy, whole-lake approach is advocated as the best way forward, not only as a means of reconstructing past climate but also as a means of assessing the impact of climate change on lake systems.",

Spatial variability in species richness has been postulated to depend upon environmental factors such as climate and climatic variability, which in turn may affect net primary productivity. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been shown to be correlated with climatic variables including rainfall, actual evapotranspiration and net primary productivity. To determine factors favoring high species richness, we examined the relationship between interannual NDVI variables and species richness of birds at a quarter degree scale (55 \u00d7 55 km). Results revealed a strong positive correlation between species richness and maximum average NDVI. Conversely, species richness showed negative correlation with standard deviation of maximum NDVI and the coefficient of variation. Though these relationships are indirect, they apparently operate through the green vegetation cover. Understanding such relationships can help in mapping and monitoring biological diversity, as well as in estimating changes in species richness in response to global climatic change.",

Peak palaeotemperatures in each episode decrease through time to produce an overall long-term cooling trend since the late Carboniferous. Thermal history styles across the region are very similar, though the magnitude of peak palaeotemperatures in individual episodes shows some variation. Similar thermal histories are also identified in the surrounding offshore regions. The regional nature of all these palaeo-thermal episodes, and their correlation with regionally significant unconformities, suggests that heating was due primarily to greater depth of burial, with subsequent cooling representing the progressive unroofing of the present onshore region since late Carboniferous times. In Northern Ireland, explanations of early Cretaceous and early Tertiary palaeotemperatures in terms of greater depth of burial are more difficult to reconcile with geological evidence, and heating due to hot fluid movement appears more likely. This applies particularly to early Tertiary effects, for which the Tertiary Igneous Province provides a ready explanation. Over the entire onshore region, maximum maturity levels in Carboniferous and older units were reached at the end of the Carboniferous, and preservation of hydrocarbons to the present day, through several tectono-thermal episodes, appears unlikely.",

From an ecological point of view the area is highly sensitive and both food security and soil conservation are becoming serious problems for the rapidly growing population. The intensive land cover changes observed in this area during the last few decades beg accurate analysis. Land-cover change analysis over a long time-span was performed. Interpretation (API) of aerial photographs dated 1972 and classification of a 1994 Landsat TM image were used. Problems due to the heterogeneous nature of the data were overcome with a method for quantifying land cover on aerial photographs, thus producing data comparable to TM classification results. As land cover is linked, through land use, to social dynamics, in ground control use was made of the results of parallel socio-economic investigations. From the analysis, a general trend of increase in cultivated surfaces was noted. Unique strategies of land allocation according to physical settings were observed. A trend in the evolution of badlands was identified: rapid reactivation of previous erosion in newly cropped areas occurred; within a few decades this erosion reached quasi-equilibrium. The methods adopted showed some accuracy limitations, but allowed land-cover change analysis over a 22-year time-span, providing important insight into recent phenomena and present trends.",

        "Absrtact": "Ammonia (NH3) surface/atmosphere exchange is bi-directional and as such resistance models must include canopy concentrations. An existing single layer model that describes the exchange in terms of adsorption to leaf cuticles and bi-directional transport through leaf stomata, which is governed by a stomatal compensation point (\u03c7(s)), is applied here to NH3 exchange over oilseed rape and compared with measured fluxes. For the first time the model is tested using values of \u03c7(s) based on the apoplastic ratio [NH4+]/pH (\u0393(s)) measured directly in the field. Strong NH3 emission from decomposing leaf litter at the ground and the likelihood of high [NH4+] in the siliques complicate the exchange pattern with oilseed rape and limit the application of the original model. This is therefore extended by: (a) the inclusion of a litter layer (2-layer model), with an emission potential (\u03931), (b) additionally dividing the plant canopy into a foliage- and a silique-layer (3-layer model) and (c) considering the relative humidity (h) dependency of \u03931. The 2-layer model is able to predict night-time emission, but daytime emission is estimated to originate from the litter layer, which is in contradiction to the NH3 sources and sinks derived for this canopy. The 3-layer model using a constant value of \u03931 requires an emission potential for the siliques of about 1300, which is consistent with bioassay estimates. Together with a parameterization of \u03931 that increases with h this model indicates that during daytime emission originates from the siliques, in agreement with the source/sink analysis. It is concluded that the leaf stomata were an effective NH3 sink, whereas the leaf litter dominates night-time emissions and the silique-layer (probably) daytime emissions. Although the 2-layer model reproduces the net exchange, the 3-layer model appears to be the mechanistically more accurate description. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

In this study, I focus on the role of the annual cycles in mixing, sea-surface temperature and biological production. By integrating these cycles, it is shown that the annually integrated flux of CO2 can be written as F = \u03b1(C(T)/(W) - C(Eq)), where F is the mean annual air-sea flux of CO2, \u03b1 is an equilibrium rate constant (m/year), C(T)/(W) is the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in the winter mixed layers and C(Eq) is the dynamic equilibrium concentration for C(T)/(W). In the formula,\u03b1 and C(Eq) capture the influence of the annual cycles as well as the spatial variations in, for example, the alkalinity. I analyze data from the Ocean Weather Stations (OWS) in the North Atlantic and some results from the MIT biogeochemical ocean model to find adequate descriptions of \u03b1 and C(Eq). According to these model/data estimates, the influence of the annual cycles in sea-surface temperature and biological production on the dynamic equilibrium concentration is on the order of - 5 to - 20 and 0-30 \u03bcmol/kg, respectively. These numbers are not negligible showing that the annual cycles must be considered when analyzing the oceanic carbon cycle. The spatial distribution of the quantities C(T)/(W), \u03b1, and C(Eq) are estimated for the North Atlantic using data from the TTO/NAS expedition and a combination of model and data analyses. The air-sea flux is calculated according to the above formula, and the seawards flux is estimated to be 0.4 Gt C/year for the area north of 30\u00b0N. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Mean concentrations of HNO3 and HCl were small at 0.68 and 0.32 \u03bcg m-3, respectively. At relative humidities (h) < 85% measured gas concentration products (K(m)) were smaller than the predicted dissociation constants (K(e)), suggesting potential for aerosol evaporation, but at high h, K(e) of NH4Cl was exceeded at the mean canopy height. Above the canopy, small aerosol concentrations resulted in estimated chemical time-scales of >3 min. Thus, chemical reactions should not have affected NH3 flux measurements by aerodynamic gradient methods (AGM(s)), except for very low turbulence when AGM is not applicable. Within the canopy, however, the diffusive transport provided enough time for NH4Cl to be generated. This was substantiated by measurements of NH4 + emission and high Cl-aerosol concentrations within the canopy. Micrometeorological measurements above the canopy indicated that gaseous Cl compounds were emitted for most of the time, and this was supported by the source/sink distributions of gaseous and aerosol C1 compounds calculated from in-canopy profiles as well as high apoplastic Cl- concentrations. Although emission of CH3Cl has been reported for other Brassica species, an unrealistically large emission would be necessary to cause the observed above-canopy gradients. Emission of HCl liberated from unidentified water pools of high Cl- or leaf surface reactions is a more likely source of gaseous Cl compounds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "It is shown by classical simulation and experimentation that quantum artificial neural networks (QUANNs) are more efficient and in some cases more powerful than classical artificial neural networks (CLANNs) for a variety of experimental tasks. This effect is particularly noticeable with larger and more complex domains. The gain in efficiency is achieved with no generalization loss in most cases. QUANNs are also more powerful than CLANNs, again for some of the tasks examined, in terms of what the network can learn. What is more, it appears that not all components of a QUANN architecture need to be quantum for these advantages to surface. It is demonstrated that a fully quantum neural network has no advantage over a partly quantum network and may in fact produce worse results. Overall, this work provides a first insight into the expected behaviour of individual components of QUANNs, if and when quantum hardware is ever built, and raises questions about the interface between quantum and classical components of future QUANNs.",

        "Absrtact": "Nonmetropolitan areas in the western United States have experienced rapid growth rates measured in both economic and demographic terms. Macrolevel studies have found that a variety of forces are at work driving these regional patterns of growth including quality of life migrants, expansion of service industries, and nonearnings sources of income. While these macrolevel studies provide important insights into the processes of regional change, very little is known of the significance of these contemporary development forces at the micro, or community, level. This paper reports the results of four community case studies in rapidly growing rural communities within the western United States to provide a better understanding of economic and social change at the community level. Interviews with key players in each case study community provide the empirical evidence for this paper, and the data demonstrate community development processes to be complex. Resource-dependent industrial activities remain an important component for community economies. Furthermore, extractive activity is being supplemented (not supplanted) by various combinations of the factors reported in macrolevel studies including niche manufacturing, Lone Eagles, quality of life migrants, and retirees. The case studies also highlight a high degree of volatility in growing areas and potential problems with assimilation, fractioning, and planning associated with rapid growth in these small places.

This paper investigates the impact of research centers in the pharmaceutical industry upon this neglected form of knowledge creation-innovation productivity. We find that firms with separate research facilities are more innovative than firms without such facilities. The results diverge when locational distance of the laboratory is considered for patent versus drug innovations, and vary across diversification types. These findings suggest that managers and researchers need to consider the relationship between the research center and corporate headquarters - and the role of the corporate headquarters - when developing knowledge generation strategies.",

        "Absrtact": "A large number of lithological borehole descriptions, 14C dates, archaeological artefacts, and gradients of palaeochannels were used to reconstruct the Holocene development of the Rhine-Meuse delta. Data were stored in a Geographical Information System database that enables generation of palaeogeographical maps for any time during the Holocene. The time resolution of the palaeogeographic reconstruction is about 200 years. During the Holocene, avulsion was an important process, resulting in frequent shifts of areas of clastic sedimentation. Palaeogeographic evolution of the Rhine-Meuse delta is mainly governed by complex interactions among several factors. These are: (1) Location and shape of the Late Weichselian palaeovalley. (2) Sea-level rise, which resulted in back-filling of the palaeovalley. (3) Peat formation, which was most extensive in the western part of the back-barrier area especially between 4000 and 3000 14C yr BP. This more or less fixed the river pattern at that time and resulted in few avulsions. (4) Neotectonics. Differential tectonic movements of the Peel Horst and Roer Valley Graben seem to have influenced river behaviour (formation of an asymmetrical meander belt, location of avulsion nodes), especially from 4500 to 2800 14C yr BP when the rate of sea-level rise had decreased. After 2800 14C yr BP, the sea-level rise further decreased, and the tectonic influence still may have influenced avulsions, but from then on, other factors became dominant. (5) Increased discharge, sediment load and/or within-channel sedimentation. After 2800 14C yr BP, river meanders of Rhine distributaries as well as the single channel of the Meuse show remarkable increases in wavelength, interpreted as a result of increased bankfull discharge and sediment load. Increased discharge may initially have been caused by a higher precipitation. After 2000 14C yr BP, both discharge and sediment load seem to have increased as a result of human influence. Alternatively, decreasing gradients (as a result of sea-level rise) may have caused an increased within-channel sedimentation and channel widening, which would also lead to increased meander wavelengths. (6) Composition of the river banks. Meandering river channels tend to adhere to the sandy margins of the Late Weichselian palaeovalley, and a high channel sinuosity is found in areas where river banks consist of sand. (7) Marine ingressions, e.g., the AD 1421 St. Elizabeth's flood, caused large-scale erosion in the southwestern part of the fluvial deltaic plain. (8) Human influence. Since about AD 1100 human influence dominated the palaeogeographic evolution. Rivers were embanked and dredged, meanders were cut off, and for the Meuse, a new distributary canal (the Bergsche Maas) was dug in AD 1904. Discharge distribution over the various channels is strictly controlled nowadays. An unusual feature of the delta is the prolonged existence of the Oude Rijn channel belt.

        "Absrtact": "A primitive equation, hydrostatic, terrain-following coordinate ocean general circulation model (OGCM) is used to investigate the mean water mass pathways from the subtropics to the tropics in the Atlantic Ocean. The OGCM is used in a fully realistic configuration of the Atlantic, from 30\u00b0S to 65\u00b0N, with realistic bathymetry. Surface forcings are provided by the COADS climatology. A non-eddy-resolving numerical simulation is analyzed with 3/4\u00b0horizontal resolution and 20 terrain-following vertical levels. The primary objective of this study is to assess the theoretical framework extending the ventilated thermocline theory to the equator in the context of the numerical calculation, and to establish whether the predictions of a steady-state theory can be verified in a time-dependent simulation, in which rectified seasonal effects on the time mean yearly circulation may be important. The Bernoulli function is evaluated on isopycnal surfaces outcropping in the subtropics in both hemispheres and floats are injected at different northern and southern latitudes. In both hemispheres, the interior flow velocities are parallel to the Bernoulli streamlines that are significantly modified by inertia only very near the equator and on the Equatorial UnderCurrent (EUC). In the Northern Atlantic, pathways from the subtropics to the tropics exist for the isopycnal surfaces outcropping at 20-22\u00b0N. The injected floats reach the EUC following a zigzag pattern determined by the tropical current system. It is impossible to distinguish between the western boundary and the interior exchange windows as they are merged together forming a broad exchange pathway east of the northwestward flowing North Brazil Current (NBC). This exchange window disappears for the floats injected north of ~30\u00b0N, and corresponding outcropping isopycnals \u03c30 > 25.5 kg/m3, where only the recirculating window of the subtropical gyre remains. In the Southern Atlantic, all the floats injected between 6\u00b0and 15\u00b0S migrate to the western boundary where they are entrained in the NBC. There is no interior exchange window. At the equator, some are directly entrained into the EUC, some overshoot and retroflect at ~ 8\u00b0N, then join the EUC. As the numerical simulation is carried out under surface forcings that include the seasonal cycle, we can assess the impact of the seasonal cycle on the steady-state analysis. The most important effect is due to the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which in summer is strong, and produces an 'island' of Ekman upwelling between 10\u00b0and 20\u00b0N, which is reflected in the yearly mean properties. The ICTZ-induced upwelling and interior stratification support a corresponding 'island' of high potential vorticity that penetrates in depth to all the isopycnals outcropping between 20\u00b0and 25\u00b0N. This high potential vorticity island creates a barrier that constrains the floats injected at and north of 20\u00b0N to flow around it to reach the Equator and the EUC. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The detrital age spectrum of Lower Triassic samples differ from underlying units in lacking Archean and post-Mesoproterozoic detritus. The Archean Yilgarn craton has previously been envisaged as the main source of detritus in the Perth basin. The bulk of the detritus, however, is of Mesoproterozoic age, which together with the overall broad spectrum of age ranges within individual samples indicates that the detritus was derived from multiple sources. Potential source regions recognized include the Yilgarn craton, the Mesoproterozoic Albany Fraser Orogen, the Meso- to Neoproterozoic Leeuwin complex of the Pinjarra orogen, and probably also the late Mesoproterozoic Northampton complex of the Pinjarra orogen. In addition, source terranes possibly associated with Greater India and East Antarctica, which originally formed the western and southern margins of the basin, may have also contributed detritus accounting for the input of material whose age cannot be related to the known age ranges in currently exposed bounding source blocks. The multi-sourced nature of the detritus suggests the Perth basin was not a simple half-graben structure down stepping to the west but contained a variety of uplifted blocks with an overall longitudinal supply of detritus from the south. The distribution of exposed source blocks changed dramatically at the start of the Triassic with the cessation of input from Archean and Neoproterozoic source regions. The differing age spectra between Triassic and Permian strata and between Late Permian and older sequences suggest any reworked detritus is of extra-basinal origin and not related to intra-basin erosion of underlying rock units. Potential sources for this reworked multicycle detritus are the metasedimentary sequences within the bounding source terranes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

One known atmospheric source is the formation of N2O on three-way motor vehicle catalytic converters followed by emission with the exhaust. Previous estimates of the magnitude of this N2O source have varied widely. Two methods employing tunable infrared lasers to measure N2O/CO2 ratios from a large number of on-road motor vehicles have been developed. Both methods add support to lower estimates of N2O emissions from the US motor vehicle fleet, although significant uncertainty remains. Main Abstract: Two tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS) techniques have been used to measure the N2O emission levels of on-road motor vehicle exhausts. Cross road, open path laser measurements were used to assess N2O emissions from 1361 California catalyst equipped vehicles in November, 1996 yielding an emission ratio of (8.8 \u00b1 2.8) x 10-5 N2O/CO2. A van mounted TILDAS sampling system making on-road N2O measurements in mixed traffic in June, 1998 in Manchester, New Hampshire yielded a mean N2O/CO2 ratio of (12.8 \u00b1 0.3) x 10-5, based on correlated N2O and CO2 concentration peaks attributed to motor vehicle exhaust plumes. The correlation of N2O emissions with vehicle type, model year and NO emissions are presented for the California data set. It is found that the N2O emission distribution is highly skewed, with more than 50% of the emissions being contributed by 10% of the vehicles. Comparison of our results with those from four European tunnel studies reveals a wide range of derived N2O emission indices, with the most recent studies (including this study) finding lower values.

As wash load is a non-capacity load it often is modelled using empirical relations, such as the rating curve technique. Sediment rating curves in thee form of a power function are derived for several locations along the river Rhine and its main tributaries, using different fitting procedures. Inaccuracies in estimated sediment loads are analysed, and spatial differences in the shapes of the fitted rating curves are related to watershed characteristics. Rating curves obtained by least squares regression on logarithmic transformed data underestimate, long-term sediment transport rates by 10-50%. Better estimates are obtained when nonlinear least squares regression is applied. The steepness of the fitted rating curves decreases along the main channel of the Rhine in a downstream direction. Contrary to what is generally believed this is not related to changes in the sediment transport regime. A better indication of the sediment transport regime is obtained when the slope/intercept pairs of the fitted rating curves are plotted in a graph. All locations that plot on the same line have a common discharge-concentration value and appear to be characterised by a similar sediment transport regime. At locations of which the slope/intercept pairs plot on higher lines, a larger part of the annual sediment load is transported during high discharge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A Precambrian granulite facies event at T = 800-900\u00b0C, P < 10 kbar was followed by localized Caledonian eclogite facies (T = 650-700\u00b0C and P > 15 kbar) and localized amphibolite facies reworking. During the granulite-eclogite facies transition, anorthositic rocks were converted from garnet granulites to kyanite eclogites, while phlogopite-bearing spinel lherzolite reacted to garnet lherzolite. The eclogite and amphibolite facies reequilibration took place along shear zones and fluid pathways. In the unhydrated and undeformed parts, the minerals preserved their granulite facies composition with constant Fe/Mg ratios from core to rim, suggesting diffusional reequilibration. Rb/Sr age dating was carried out on relict granulite facies minerals from three lenses of ultramafites (Alvfjellet, Hundskjeften and Kvamsfjellet). Phlogopite from phlogopite lherzolite at Alvfjellet give 857 \u00b1 9 Ma, while clinopyroxene, amphibole, phlogopite and whole rock from a lherzolite at Hundskjeften yield an age of 842 \u00b1 12 Ma (MSWD = 1.9). Clinopyroxene, feldspar, orthopyroxene phlogopite and whole rock from websterite, Kvamsfjellet, yield an age of 835 \u00b1 7 Ma (MSWD < 1), while clinopyroxene, phlogopite and whole rock from a lherzolite from the same lens gives a result of 882 \u00b1 9 Ma. These results are interpreted as minimum ages for the granulite facies event and only slightly younger than, or overlap with previous U-Pb zircon ages (929 \u00b1 1 Ma) and Sm-Nd garnet-pyroxene ages (890-923 Ma) interpreted to date the end of the granulite facies event. By contrast, ages obtained for the eclogite and amphibolite facies range from 460 (U-Pb, sphene), 440 (Ar-Ar), 419 (U-Pb, zircon) to 410 Ma (Rb/Sr mineral ages). These results demonstrate that the reopening temperature for the Rb/Sr system in phlogopite-biotite under dry and static high-pressure conditions is, in the given mineral assemblages, at least 650\u00b0C, considerably higher than the 300-400\u00b0C assumed as the closure temperature of this system. We ascribe this elevated reopening temperature to fluid absent conditions that prevented element transport and rehomogenization. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

An 11 Myr sedimentary record at ODP Sites 885/886 at 44.7\u00b0N, 168.3\u00b0W allows the evaluation of how such dust and its sources have changed in response to late Cenozoic climate and tectonics. The extracted eolian fraction contains variable amounts (>70%) of clay minerals with subordinate quartz and plagioclase. Uniform Nd isotopic compositions (\u03b5(Nd) = -8.6 to -10.5) and Sm/Nd ratios (0.170-0.192) for most of the 11 Myr record demonstrate a well-mixed provenance in the basins north of the Tibetan Plateau and the Gobi Desert that was a source of dust long before the oldest preserved Asian loess formed. \u03b5(Nd) values of up to -6.5 for samples <2.9 Ma indicate \u226435 wt% admixture of a young, Kamchatka-like volcanic arc component. The coherence of Pb and Nd in the erosional cycle allows us to constrain the Pb isotopic composition of Asian loess devoid of anthropogenic contamination to 206Pb/204Pb = 18.97 \u00b1 0.06, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.67 \u00b1 0.02, 208Pb/204Pb = 39.19 \u00b1 0.11. 87Sr/86Sr (0.711-0.721) and Rb/Sr ratios (0.39-1.1) vary with dust mineralogy and provide an age indication of ~250 Ma. 40Ar/39Ar ages of six dust samples are uniform around 200 Ma and match the K-Ar ages of modern dust deposited on Hawaii. These data reflect the weighted age average of illite formation. Changes from illite\u2265smectite with significant kaolinite to illite- and chlorite-rich, kaolinite-free assemblages since the late Pliocene document changes in the intensity of chemical weathering in the source region. Such weathering evidently did not disturb the K-Ar systematics, and only induced scatter in the Rb-Sr data. We propose that when smectite forms at the expense of illite, K and Ar are quantitatively lost from what becomes smectite, but are quantitatively retained in adjacent illite layers. 40Ar/39Ar age data, therefore, are insensitive to smectite formation during chemical weathering but date the diagenetic growth of illite, the major K-bearing phase in the dust. Over the past 12 Myr, the dust flux to the north Pacific increased by more than an order of magnitude, documenting a substantial drying of central Asia. This climatic change, however, did not alter the ultimate source of the dust, and neoformational products of chemical weathering always remained subordinate to assemblages reworked by mechanical erosion in dust deposited in eastern Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

        "Absrtact": "Alkenone unsaturation ratios and planktonic \u03b418O records from sediment cores of the Alboran, Ionian and Levantine basins in the Mediterranean Sea show pronounced variations in paleo-temperatures and -salinities of surface waters over the last 16,000 years. Average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are low during the last glacial (averages prior to 13,000 years: 11-15 \u00b0C), vary rapidly at the beginning of the Holocene, and increase to 17-18 \u00b0C at all sites during S1 formation (dated between 9500 and 6600 calendar years). The modern temperature gradient (2-3 \u00b0C) between the Mediterranean sub-basins is maintained during formation of sapropel S1 in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. After S1, SSTs have remained uniform in the Alboran Sea at 18 \u00b0C and have fluctuated around 20 \u00b0C in the Ionian and Levantine Basin sites. The \u03b418O of planktonic foraminifer calcite decreases by 2\u2030 from the late glacial to S1 sediments in the Ionian Basin and by 2.8\u2030 in the Levantine Basin. In the Alboran Sea, the decrease is 1.7\u2030. Of the 2.8\u2030 decrease in the Levantine Basin, the effect of global ice Volume accounts for a maximum of 1.05\u2030 and the temperature increase explains only a maximum of 1.3\u2030. The remainder is attributed to salinity changes. We use the temperature and salinity estimates to calculate seawater density changes. They indicate that a reversal of water mass circulation is not a likely explanation for increased carbon burial during S1 time. Instead, it appears that intermediate and deep water formation may have shifted to the Ionian Sea approximately 2000 years before onset of S1 deposition, because surface waters were as cold, but saltier than surface water in the Levantine Basin during the Younger Dryas. Sapropel S1 began to form at the same time, when a significant density decrease also occurred in the Ionian Sea. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Absrtact": "The Jameson Land basin in East Greenland comprises a well exposed succession of Upper Paleozoic-Mesozoic sediments. During Middle Devonian-Early Permian rifting, ~ 13 km of continental clastics were deposited. In latest Paleozoic to Mesozoic times, ~ 4 km of sediments accumulated during regional subsidence. In the Early Paleocene, during North Atlantic break-up, the basin was covered by a thick volcanic pile. Subsequently, uplift and erosion took place over the whole region. The volcanic cover was completely removed from Jameson Land and erosion cut deeply into the underlying sediments. To assess the exploration potential of Jameson Land, a basin modelling study with 21 1D pseudo-wells was carried out based on all seismic and surface data available. In addition to the calculation of hydrocarbon generation in space and time, the basin modelling provided an opportunity to study the magnitude and timing of uplift and erosion. Basin modelling constrained by apatite fission track data has made it possible to determine a consistent uplift and erosion history of the area. Tectonic backstripping based on a simple Airy type isostatic model has been used to separate the tectonic uplift from the actual uplift. The combined basin modelling and backstripping study has led to the following conclusions: (1) the thickness of the Cretaceous succession varied from 1.3 km in the south to 0.3 km in the north; (2) the volcanic rocks formed a wedge with a thickness of > 2 km in the south thinning to < 0.1 km in the north; (3) the subsequent erosion of 2-3 km is in response to tectonic uplift with a magnitude of ~ 1 km, and the calculated tectonic uplift shows increasing values to the north. The erosion rate generally accelerated from Late Paleocene up to the present time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We show that the linear Taylor expansion of a nonlinear model output also gives a tool to detect the possible ill-conditioning of neural network candidates, and to estimate their performance. Finally, we show that the least squares and linear Taylor expansion based approach compares favorably with other analytic approaches, and that it is an efficient and economic alternative to the nonanalytic and computationally intensive bootstrap methods.",

The oxygen-penetration depth in these sediments is on the order of 10-15 mm, indicating that organic carbon is mineralized aerobically within this interval. Below this depth, organic matter degradation proceeds mostly through anoxic mineralization processes. The organic carbon content of these sediments decreases smoothly with depth. At all sites, the bottom water is supersaturated with respect to calcite. However, in most cores, immediately below the sediment-water interface, the acidity produced by the aerobic degradation of organic matter is sufficient to overcome the supersaturation of the overlying waters and induce CaCO3 dissolution. This is most strongly reflected by an increase in the porewater calcium concentration near the sediment-water interface. Deeper in the cores, the saturation state of the porewaters increases at depth as a result of alkalinity generation by sulfate reduction and CaCO3 of precipitates. Unlike organic carbon, the inorganic carbon content of the sediments therefore varies little or even increases with depth because what is lost through dissolution near the sediment-water interface is replaced at depth by precipitation. The carbon precipitated as CaCO3 in the sulfate-reduction zone originates in part from the organic carbon, resulting in the preservation of a fraction of the original organic carbon as inorganic carbon. The precipitation of CaCO3 in the anoxic zone creates an additional source of CO2 to the porewaters. The geochemical significance of this source is discussed.",

        "Absrtact": "The Hong'an region in the Qinling-Dabie collisional zone in eastern China hosts a series of metamorphic rocks exposing a south-to-north distribution from blueschist/blueschist-greenschist, amphibolite, eclogite (kyanite free) and kyanite-eclogite to coesite-eclogite facies rocks that represent progressively deeper levels of the Mesozoic subduction-collision complex. The Hong'an area is interesting for three reasons: (1) it escaped the thermal and structural overprint imparted on much of the Dabie Mountains during Early Cretaceous intrusion of voluminous granites and granodiorites; (2) the high-pressure (HP) Hong'an eclogites are widely distributed, often preserve prograde crystallization histories and can be directly linked in time and space to the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist rocks exposed to the south; (3) the blueschist/blueschist-greenschist facies rocks are generally better exposed than their equivalents in the southeastern Dabie Mountains and offer some opportunity for simultaneous structural and metamorphic analysis. The Hong'an area HP rocks offer perhaps the closest approximation to a preserved snapshot of Mesozoic pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions attending early subduction-exhumation in the region, and are thus essential to generating a coherent picture of the dynamics attending both metamorphism and exposure of the coeval ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks. The purpose of this contribution is twofold: (1) to document previously unpublished metamorphic and structural data characterizing these HP sequences and their relative continuity in Hong'an; (2) to incorporate these data with recent geochronologic, structural and paleomagnetic information in the context of protracted, late Paleozoic through Mesozoic subduction, collision and exhumation. Metamorphism and exhumation of some of the southern Hong'an HP sequences appear to have occurred concomitant with oceanic subduction immediately to the west, and thus may have preceded widespread continental subduction/collision. Moreover, all of the HP-UHP sequences in the region were exhumed before the end of collision between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons at ca. 160 Ma. Exhumation of HP-UHP rocks both before and during continental plate collision is neither novel for central China nor for other HP-UHP zones, but is important to take into account when reconstructing the evolution of such orogens.

        "Absrtact": "The coastal upwelling system of the Peru-Chile Current belongs to the most productive regions in the world oceans. In spite of this remarkable fact only very little is known about the sediment distribution in its southern part off the coast of Chile. To increase the knowledge about this region a multiparameter study of the surface sediment distribution along the Chilean continental slope between 27 and 42\u00b0S has been carried out. Detailed analyses of sedimentary data (TOC and carbonate contents, \u03b413C(org), \u03b415N), of the species composition of planktic foraminifera and of the stable isotope composition of the two planktic foraminifera species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (dex.) and Globigerina bulloides reveal a close relation to environmental conditions in the region. The pattern of a southward increase of surface water productivity known from satellite data is closely reflected in the organic carbon and \u03b415N data. Information about the water mass distribution, especially about varying influences of upwelling waters and warmer Subtropical Surface Waters, can be derived from the species composition of the planktic foraminifera, while the stable isotope data provide additional clues about water mass characteristics. High productivity along the Chilean margin north of 40\u00b0S is sustained by coastal upwelling, while further to the south advection of nutrients with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and a significant riverine input fuel the highest productivity found in the study area. This data set will provide the base for future paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic reconstructions of the Southeast Pacific region. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Secondary structural studies for this region of the HIV-1 genome have shown the existence of a stem-loop structure capped by a purine-rich tetraloop. Extensive mapping data presented here lead to the complete characterisation of the structure of the stem-loop, including a new purine-rich internal loop in the lower part of the structure and the previously established GGAG tetraloop at its tip. Biochemical analysis reveals that both internal loop and tetraloop are primary sites for interaction with Gag polyprotein, and that binding of Gag protein leads to a conformational change which alters the RNA structure. NMR spectroscopy has been used to determine the three-dimensional structure of this complete stem-loop structure. The structural analysis reveals a significant difference between the apical part of the stem-loop structure, which adopts a well-defined conformation, and the purine-rich internal loop, which is instead very flexible. In contrast to what is generally observed for internal loop structures in RNA, this region of the encapsidation signal adopts a structure lacking stable interstrand interactions capable of stabilising a unique conformation. We suggest that the stem-loop structure represents a nucleation site for Gag protein binding, and that the protein exploits the flexibility of the internal loop to initiate the unwinding of the structure with successive addition of Gag molecules interacting with the RNA and each other through conserved I (interaction) domains.

        "Absrtact": "Mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced from a wide variety of organisms, including an increasing number of parasites. They maintain some characteristics in common across the spectrum of life-a common core of genes related to mitochondrial respiration being most prominent-but have also developed a great diversity of gene content, organisation, and expression machineries. The characteristics of mitochondrial genomes vary widely among the different groups of protozoan parasites, from the minute genomes of the apicomplexans to amoebae with 20 times as many genes. Kinetoplastid protozoa have a similar number of genes to metazoans, but the details of gene organisation and expression in kinetoplastids require extraordinary mechanisms. Mitochondrial genes in nematodes and trematodes appear quite sedate in comparison, but a closer look shows a strong tendency to unusual tRNA structure and alternative initiation codons among these groups. Mitochondrial genes are increasingly coming into play as aids to phylogenetic and epidemiologic analyses, and mitochondrial functions are being recognised as potential drug targets. In addition, examination of mitochondrial genomes is producing further insights into the diversity of the wide-ranging group of organisms comprising the general category of parasites.

Despite such gross similarities they exhibit opposite trends in \u03b413C(TOC) versus wt% decarbonated total organic carbon (TOC; r= -0.76 for WMF, and 0.71 for KCF); the \u03b413C(TOC) versus TOC trend also varies geographically within both units. Only the KCF data exhibit a positive correlation between \u03b413C(TOC) and \u03b415N(org) (r=0.76) and the presence of aryl isoprenoids (probable indicators of photic zone anoxia). Maturity differences are insufficient to explain such contrasts. Bulk and compound-specific isotopic variations in the KCF are interpreted largely as a reflection of primary productivity during deposition, rather than a dominantly diagenetic signal due to incorporation of sulphurised carbohydrate. The contrasts between the formations, and the geographic variation in coeval shelf sediments, are explained by a model stressing the relative positions and stabilities of the chemocline, pycnocline, nutricline and euphotic zone, and the effect these have on productivity, CO2 recycling, and bacterial floras.

        "Absrtact": "The composite Guerrero Terrane of western Mexico records much of the magmatic evolution of southwestern North America during Late Mesozoic time. The Guerrero includes three distinctive subterranes characterized by unique stratigraphic records, structural evolutions, and geochemical and isotopic features that strongly suggest they evolved independently. The eastern Teloloapan Subterrane represents an evolved intra-oceanic island arc of Hauterivian to Cenomanian age, which includes a high-K calck-alkaline magmatic suite. The central Arcelia-Palmar Chico Subterrane represents a primitive island arc-marginal basin system of Albian to Cenomanian age, consisting of an oceanic suite and a tholeiitic arc suite. The western Zihuatanejo-Huetamo Subterrane comprises three components that represent an evolved island arc-marginal basin-subduction complex system of Late Jurassic (?) - Early Cretaceous age built on a previously deformed basement. The Zihuatanejo Sequence includes a thick high-K calc-alkaline magmatic suite. The Las Ollas Complex consists of tectonic slices containing exotic blocks of arc affinity affected by high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphism included in a sheared matrix. The Huetamo Sequence consists mainly of volcanic-arc derived sedimentary rocks, including large pebbles of tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, and shoshonitic lavas. These sequences are unconformably underlain by the Arteaga Complex, which represents the subvolcanic basement. On the basis of available geology, geochemistry, geochronology, and isotopic data, we suggest that Late Mesozoic volcanism along the western margin of southern North America developed in broadly contemporaneous but different intra-oceanic island arcs that constitute a complex fossil arc-trench system similar to the present-day western Pacific island arc system. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V..

However, research suggests potential conflicts between the conditions conducive to conceptual growth and those conducive to procedural. The study reported here with 9- to 12-year old pupils endorses this, but suggests that the problems can be overcome given tasks where pupils: (a) debate their conceptual knowledge and reach consensus; (b) subject their consensual positions to guided experimental appraisal and draw conclusions from what transpires. It is argued that the demonstrated role of consensus has consequences not just for educational practice but also for psychological theories of development and learning. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

By collecting historical data on interstate highway construction and economic activity in the United States at the county level we find that highways have a differential impact across industries: certain industries grow as a result of reduced transportation costs, whereas other shrink as economic activity relocates. Additionally, we find that highways affect the spatial allocation of economic activity. They raise the level of economic activity in the counties that they pass directly through, but draw activity away from adjacent counties. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Absrtact": "The Hell's Gate alluvial fan of northern Death Valley has an area of 49.5 km2, a radius of 11.8 km, and a smooth 5-3\u00b0sloping surface interrupted by shallow (<0.5 m), radially aligned gullies 1-4 m wide. Facies analysis of 1-14 m high exposures at 45 sites reveals that the fan is built almost entirely by water-flow processes. Two facies deposited by sheetflooding dominate the exposures from apex to toe. The main one (Facies A), comprising 80-95% of the cuts, consists of sandy, granular, fine to medium pebble gravel that alternates with cobbly, coarse to very coarse pebble gravel in planar-stratified couplets 5-20 cm thick that are aligned parallel to the fan surface. Facies B, comprising 0-10% of the exposures, consists of 10-40 cm thick wedge-planar beds of sandy pebble gravel in backsets dipping 5 to 24\u00b0. Both Facies A and B are produced by infrequent sediment-charged flash floods from the catchment, and accumulate on the fan from supercritical standing waves of an expanding sheetflood. Antidune backsets are deposited during the buildup stage of the standing-wave cycle, and the couplets during the washout stage. The autocyclic growth and destruction of standing waves during a single sheetflood produces 50-250 cm thick sequences of multiple couplets with backsets. Couplets prevail over antidunes due to the selective preservation of deposits of the standing wave washout phase. Three minor facies comprise 5-20% of the fan exposures. The most common one (Facies D) is pebbly cobble gravel in lenticular beds typically 5-25 cm thick that overlie erosional scours into sheetflood deposits. It comprises gravel concentrated in gullies by fine-fraction winnowing of sheetflood units during recessional flood or by secondary overland flows. Though common on the fan surface, this facies is stratigraphically limited. Facies C consists of medium- to very fine-grained eolian sandsheet deposits 5-30 cm thick present on the distal fan in association with gully-fill gravel. It forms by wind reworking of the fan surface, and by sand transport from the adjoining erg. Facies C and D gully-fill and eolian deposits together comprise bounding beds that divide successive sheetflood sequences. They record secondary processes active on the surface between infrequent sheetfloods that mainly aggrade the fan. The fifth fan facies (Facies E) consists of lakeshore gravel deposited along the distal fan when it was transgressed by Lake Manly during latest Pleistocene time. The medial 3.8 km part of the Hell's Gate fan is uplifted and backtilted 1 to 16\u00b0into a tectonic ridge formed during strike-slip motion along the North Death Valley fault. Progressive intrafan unconformities, each likely initiated during one large earthquake, are common in these deposits. Two to eight sheetflood units capped by gully-fill or eolian facies are exposed within unconformity-bounded intervals, indicating that fan-aggrading catastrophic sheetfloods on a given part of fan are 2 to \u22658 times more frequent than earthquakes that cause backtilting.

Textural relationships support the hypothesis of garnet formation by peritectic reactions involving high-jadeite clinopyroxene, while inclusions entrapped in garnet, mainly a wide range of amphibole compositions, seemingly crystallised from a fluid phase in disequilibrium with the garnet host. Thermobarometric estimates indicate UHP, HT peak conditions (2.8-3.2 GPa, 780-840\u00b0C) inconsistent with those of the associated rocks, followed by a complicated exhumation path. The P-T-array of the retrograde path suggests syn-subduction exhumation and tectonic inclusion in a melange with a matrix derived from the accretionary wedge. Partial melting of the subducting slab, which induces tectonic weakening, may be an effective mechanism in detaching and enclosing small eclogite pods in metamorphic terrains.

        "Absrtact": "The study of the kinetics of heterogeneous catalyzed reactions consists of three different aspects: kinetics studies for design purposes, kinetics studies of mechanistic details and kinetics as a consequence of a reaction mechanism. The latter aspect is clearly the least explored of the three and it will not become routine until the development and analysis of microkinetic models is automated. Based on a survey of existing microkinetic models of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, three classes of Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanisms are shown to be suitable for microkinetic modeling. The first model consists of an LH mechanism with the quasi-equilibrium approximation and a single, rate-limiting step. For this model detailed kinetic studies are possible and include the analytic determination of reaction rate, surface coverages, reaction orders and activation energy. The second model consists of an LH mechanism with the steady-state (SS) approximation. This model allows the treatment of some kinetic phenomena, which cannot be treated by Model 1. However, the treatment of Model 2 is much more difficult and the data which may be determined analytically from Model 2 are the reaction rate, the surface coverages and the degree of rate limitation. The third model is kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations which allow the modeling of even more mechanistic details, such as surface diffusion and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Analysis of this class of models are limited to numerical simulation. Two appendices present the implementation of a Runge-Kutta (RK) integration of the conversion through an isothermal plug-flow reactor and a KMC simulation of a reaction rate, respectively.",

        "Absrtact": "We report the first 39Ar-40Ar ages from the three early basic shield-like massifs of Tenerife, Canary islands, and couple these with detailed major and trace element chemistry to constrain the nature and timing of the mantle melting processes. The massifs have chemically different sources, and independent evolutionary histories. The Teno and Roque del Conde massifs appear chemically to represent the products of single mantle melting cycles, with progressive decrease in mean melt fraction and increase in mean melting depth in younger rocks. The Teno massif (NW) was erupted in a short time period around 6.0-6.4 Ma, while at least the lower half of the Roque del Conde massif (SW) is older than 11 Ma. In contrast, the Anaga massif (NE) is polygenetic, with 39Ar-40Ar ages ranging from 8.0-4.2 Ma, and no simple stratigraphic chemical progression. These ages run counter to published suggestions of progressive younging of Canary shield stages to the southwest. Basic rocks in all three massifs are the result of much deeper melting and smaller melt fractions than equivalent units in Gran Canaria, but nevertheless the melting column must have extended significantly into the spinel facies, requiring substantial disruption of the local lithosphere. The age and melting relationships broadly support the mantle blob model for Canary magmatism proposed by Hoernle and Schmincke (Hoernle, K., Schminke, H.-U., 1993. The role of partial melting in the 15-Ma geochemical evolution of Gran Canaria: a blob model for the Canary hotspot. J. Petrol. 34, 599-626). In all three massifs, extensive fractional crystallisation has taken place at crustal levels so that mean MgO contents are only some 6-7%. The fractionation sequence is olivine-clinopyroxene-magnetite in basaltic compositions, with the involvement of plagioclase, amphibole and apatite only to generate the infrequent more evolved hawaiites to benmoreites. Despite the abundance of basanitic magmas in the Tenerife older massifs, these follow a differentiation trend towards weakly undersaturated benmoreite rather than to phonolite. This probably reflects early crystallisation of magnetite, perhaps resulting from somewhat high oxygen fugacity. The chemical evidence for replenished magma chambers in Tenerife described by Neumann et al. (Neumann, E.R., Wulff-Oedersen, E., Simonsen, S.L., Pearson, N.J., Mart\u00ed, J., Mitjavila, J., 1999. Evidence for fractional crystallisation of periodically refilled magma chambers in Tenerife, Canary Islands. J. Petrol. 40, 1089-1123) is a consequence of treating as a single cogenetic suite the products of several magmatic systems that differ in parental melt fraction. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.
