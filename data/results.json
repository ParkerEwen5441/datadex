        "Abstract": "This paper describes BomJi, a supervised system for capturing discriminative attributes in word pairs (e.g. yellow as discriminative for banana over watermelon). The system relies on an XGB classifier trained on carefully engineered graph-, pattern- and word embedding based features. It participated in the SemEval- 2018 Task 10 on Capturing Discriminative Attributes, achieving an F1 score of 0:73 and ranking 2nd out of 26 participant systems.",
