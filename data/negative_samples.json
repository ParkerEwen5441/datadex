        "Abstract": "We present the discovery of substellar-mass companions to three giant stars by the ongoing Penn State-Toru\\'n Planet Search (PTPS) conducted with the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The most massive of the three stars, K2-giant HD 240237, has a 5.3 MJ minimum mass companion orbiting the star at a 746-day period. The K0-giant BD +48 738 is orbited by a > 0.91 MJ planet which has a period of 393 days and shows a non-linear, long-term radial velocity trend that indicates a presence of another, more distant companion, which may have a substellar mass or be a low-mass star. The K2-giant HD 96127, has a > 4.0 MJ mass companion in a 647-day orbit around the star. The two K2-giants exhibit a significant RV noise that complicates the detection of low-amplitude, periodic variations in the data. If the noise component of the observed RV variations is due to solar-type oscillations, we show, using all the published data for the substellar companions to giants, that its amplitude is anti-correlated with stellar metallicity."

        "Title": "A Chandra observation of the old open cluster M67",
        "Abstract": "We present the results of a 47-ks Chandra-ACIS observation of the old open cluster M67. We detected 25 proper-motion cluster members (including ten new sources) and 12 sources (all new) that we suspect to be members from their locations close to the main sequence (1 < B-V < 1.7). Of the detected members, 23 are binaries. Among the new sources that are members and probable members are four spectroscopic binaries with P_orb < 12 d, two contact binaries and two periodic photometric variables with P_ph < 8.4 d. Their X-rays are likely the result of coronal activity enhanced by tidally locked rapid rotation. The X-rays of the new source S997, a blue straggler in a wide eccentric orbit, are puzzling. Spectral fits show that the X-rays of the brightest sources S1063 (a binary with a sub-subgiant), S1082 (a triple blue straggler with a close binary) and S1040 (a circular binary of a giant and a cool white dwarf), are consistent with coronal emission. We detected a new bright source that must have brightened at least about ten times since the time of the ROSAT observations. It is not clear whether its faint blue optical counterpart belongs to M67. We discuss the possibility that this source is a low-mass X-ray binary in quiescence, which would be the first of its kind in an open cluster. In addition to cluster members, we detected about 100 background sources, many of which we identify with faint objects in the ESO Imaging Survey."

        "Title": "Extracting and Learning a Dependency-Enhanced Type Lexicon for Dutch",
        "Abstract": "This thesis is concerned with type-logical grammars and their practical applicability as tools of reasoning about sentence syntax and semantics. The focal point is narrowed to Dutch, a language exhibiting a large degree of word order variability. In order to overcome difficulties arising as a result of that variability, the thesis explores and expands upon a type grammar based on Multiplicative Intuitionistic Linear Logic, agnostic to word order but enriched with decorations that aim to reduce its proof-theoretic complexity. An algorithm for the conversion of dependency-annotated sentences into type sequences is then implemented, populating the type logic with concrete, data-driven lexical types. Two experiments are ran on the resulting grammar instantiation. The first pertains to the learnability of the type-assignment process by a neural architecture. A novel application of a self-attentive sequence transduction model is proposed; contrary to established practices, it constructs types inductively by internalizing the type-formation syntax, thus exhibiting generalizability beyond a pre-specified type vocabulary. The second revolves around a deductive parsing system that can resolve structural ambiguities by consulting both word and type information; preliminary results suggest both excellent computational efficiency and performance."

        "Abstract": "The sub-mm bump observed in the spectrum of Sgr A* appears to indicate the existence of a compact emitting component within several Schwarzschild radii, $r_S$, of the nucleus at the Galactic Center. This is interesting in view of the predicted circularized flow within $\\sim 5-10 r_S$, based on detailed multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of Bondi-Hoyle accretion onto this unusual object. In this paper, we examine the physics of magnetic field generation by a Keplerian dynamo subject to the conditions pertaining to Sgr A*, and show that the sub-mm bump can be produced by thermal synchrotron emission in this inner region. This spectral feature may therefore be taken as indirect evidence for the existence of this circularization. In addition, the self-Comptonization of the sub-mm bump appears to produce an X-ray flux exceeding that due to bremsstrahlung from this region, which may account for the X-ray counterpart to Sgr A* discovered recently by {\\it Chandra}. However, the required accretion rate in the Keplerian flow is orders of magnitude smaller than that predicted by the Bondi-Hoyle simulations. We speculate that rapid evaporation, in the form of a wind, may ensue from the heating associated with turbulent mixing of gas elements with large eccentricity as they settle down into a more or less circular (i.e., low eccentricity) trajectory. The spectrum of Sgr A* longward of $\\sim 1-2$ mm may be generated outside of the Keplerian flow, where the gas is making a transition from a quasi-spherical infall into a circularized pattern."

Given a 3D bust model as reference, our sketching system takes as input a user-drawn sketch (consisting of hair contour and a few strokes indicating the hair growing direction within a hair region), and automatically generates a 3D hair model, which matches the input sketch both globally and locally. The key enablers of our system are two carefully designed neural networks, namely, S2ONet, which converts an input sketch to a dense 2D hair orientation field; and O2VNet, which maps the 2D orientation field to a 3D vector field. Our system also supports hair editing with additional sketches in new views. This is enabled by another deep neural network, V2VNet, which updates the 3D vector field with respect to the new sketches. All the three networks are trained with synthetic data generated from a 3D hairstyle database. We demonstrate the effectiveness and expressiveness of our tool using a variety of hairstyles and also compare our method with prior art."

The proposed SRFD algorithm classifies the bang-bang phase detector(BBPD) outputs to estimate the current phase state, and detects the frequency mismatch between the input data and the sampling clock. The VCO-track path in a digital loop filter (DLF) enables online calibration of a drifted frequency of VCO caused by temperature or voltage variation after a frequency acquisition. The proposed algorithm can be implemented as a digitally-synthesized circuit, lowering design efforts for referenceless CDRs. A 10 Gbps transceiver IC with the proposed algorithm, fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process, demonstrates successful recovery of the input phase without any reference clock."

Furthermore, the test tag-set is not identical to any individual training tag-set. Yet, the relations between all tags are provided in a tag hierarchy, covering the test tags as a combination of training tags. This setting occurs when various datasets are created using different annotation schemes. This is also the case of extending a tag-set with a new tag by annotating only the new tag in a new dataset. We propose to use the given tag hierarchy to jointly learn a neural network that shares its tagging layer among all tag-sets. We compare this model to combining independent models and to a model based on the multitasking approach. Our experiments show the benefit of the tag-hierarchy model, especially when facing non-trivial consolidation of tag-sets."

We describe two methods that can improve upon a simple weighted sum, that are optimal in the sense that they maximizes a particular weighted cosine similarity measure.   We consider several weighting functions, including inverse document frequency (idf), smooth inverse frequency (SIF), and the sub-sampling function used in word2vec. We find that idf works best for our applications. We also use common component removal proposed by Arora et al. as a post-process and find it is helpful in most cases.   We compare these embeddings variations to the doc2vec embedding on a new evaluation task using TripAdvisor reviews, and also on the CQADupStack benchmark from the literature."

        "Abstract": "I study some aspects of common envelope evolution, where a compact star enters the envelope of a giant star. I show that in some binary systems under a narrow range of parameters, a substantial fraction of the giant stellar envelope is lost before the onset of the common envelope. The reduced envelope mass at the onset of the common envelope implies that the binary system emerges from the common envelope with a relatively large orbital separation. I therefore caution against a simple treatment, which omits this process, in the study of systems that evolved through a common envelope phase and ended with a relatively large orbital separation, e.g., PG1115+166. A fraction of the envelope that is lost while the companion is still outside the giant stellar envelope is accreted by the companion. The companion may form an accretion disk and blow two jets. I propose this scenario for the formation of the bipolar planetary nebula NGC 2346, which has a binary nucleus with an orbital period longer than that of any other known binary system in planetary nebulae. Because this scenario, of a late common envelope phase, occurs for a narrow range of parameters, I expect it to be applicable to a small, but non-negligible, number of systems."

        "Abstract": "A recent experiment with squeezed light has shown that two-photon absorption by an atom can occur with a linear intensity dependence. We point out that this result verifies a prediction made by us more than a decade ago from an analysis of a nonlocal model of QED. This model had earlier been proposed by us in an ad hoc manner to interpret certain features of multiphoton double ionization and above-threshold ionization in an atom placed in a strong laser field ; in this paper we show that the model can be obtained field- theoretically by demanding covariance of the field Lagrangian under a nonlocal U(1) gauge transformation. The model also makes direct contact with squeezed light, and thus allows us to describe these two completely different scenarios from a unified point of view.   We obtain a fundamentally new result from our nonlocal QED, namely that only the past, but not the future, can influence the present - thus establishing a non-thermodynamic arrow of time at the quantum level. We also show that correlations within a quantum system should necessarily be of the EPR-type, a result that agrees with Bell's theorem. These results follow from the simple requirement of energy conservation in matter-radiation interaction. Furthermore, we also predict new and experimentally verifiable results on the basis of our model QED."

Unlike previous efforts in the field, that fit only the parameters to the fixed functional forms, we instead use a novel algorithm to search the space of many possible functional forms. While a follow-on practical procedure will use experimental and {\\it ab inito} data to find an optimal functional form for a forcefield, we first validate the approach using a manufactured solution. This validation has the advantage of a well-defined metric of success. We manufactured a training set of atomic coordinate data with an associated set of global energies using the well-known Lennard-Jones inter-atomic potential. We performed an automatic functional form fitting procedure starting with a population of random functions, using a genetic programming functional formulation, and a parallel tempering Metropolis-based optimization algorithm. Our massively-parallel method independently discovered the Lennard-Jones function after searching for several hours on 100 processors and covering a miniscule portion of the configuration space. We find that the method is suitable for unsupervised discovery of functional forms for inter-atomic potentials/force-fields. We also find that our parallel tempering Metropolis-based approach significantly improves the optimization convergence time, and takes good advantage of the parallel cluster architecture."

        "Title": "Statistical Theory of Spin Relaxation and Diffusion in Solids",
        "Abstract": "A comprehensive theoretical description is given for the spin relaxation and diffusion in solids. The formulation is made in a general statistical-mechanical way. The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

The model used in our experiments is trained to project an image and its spoken description in a common representation space. We show that a recurrent model trained on spoken sentences implicitly segments its input into word-like units and reliably maps them to their correct visual referents. We introduce a methodology originating from linguistics to analyse the representation learned by neural networks -- the gating paradigm -- and show that the correct representation of a word is only activated if the network has access to first phoneme of the target word, suggesting that the network does not rely on a global acoustic pattern. Furthermore, we find out that not all speech frames (MFCC vectors in our case) play an equal role in the final encoded representation of a given word, but that some frames have a crucial effect on it. Finally, we suggest that word representation could be activated through a process of lexical competition."

        "Abstract": "We study the distribution of bright star-forming complexes in a homogeneous sample of 72 late-type (``irregular'') dwarf galaxies located within the 10 Mpc volume. Star-forming complexes are identified as bright lumps in B-band galaxy images and isolated by means of the unsharp-masking method. For the sample as a whole the radial number distribution of bright lumps largely traces the underlying exponential-disk light profiles, but peaks at a 10 percent smaller scale length. Moreover, the presence of a tail of star forming regions out to at least six optical scale lengths provides evidence against a systematic star formation truncation within that galaxy extension. Considering these findings, we apply a scale length-independent concentration index, taking into account the implied non-uniform random spread of star formation regions throughout the disk. The number profiles frequently manifest a second, minor peak at about two scale lengths. Relying on a two-dimensional stochastic self-propagating star formation model, we show these secondary peaks to be consistent with triggered star formation; for a few of the brighter galaxies a peculiar peak distribution is observed that is conceivably due to the onset of shear provided by differential rotation. On scales between 100 and 1000 pc, and by taking into account exponential-disk structure, bright lumps reveal cluster dimensions between 1.3 and 2, with a weak trend to higher dimensions for brighter galaxies. Interpreting cluster dimension in terms of porosity of a self-similar intragalactic medium, we derive a relation between current star formation rate, scale length, and porosity."

        "Abstract": "The development of valleytronics demands long-range electronic transport with preserved valley index, a degree of freedom similar to electron spin. A promising structure for this end is a topological one-dimensional (1D) channel formed in bilayer graphene (BLG) under special electrostatic conditions or specific stacking configuration, called domain wall (DW). In these 1D channels, the valley-index defines the propagation direction of the charge carriers and the chiral edge states (kink states) are robust over many kinds of disorder. However, the fabrication of DWs is challenging, requiring the design of complex multi-gate structures or have been producing on rough substrates, showing a limited mean free path. Here, we report on a high-quality DW formed at the curved boundary of folded bilayer graphene (folded-BLG). At such 1D conducting channel we measured a two-terminal resistance close to the quantum resistance $R = e^2/4h$ at zero magnetic field, a signature of kink states. Our experiments reveal a long-range ballistic transport regime that occurs only at the DW of the folded-BLG, while the other regions behave like semiconductors with tunable band gap."

        "Title": "The Initial Conditions of the Universe from Constrained Simulations",
        "Abstract": "I present a new approach to recover the primordial density fluctuations and the cosmic web structure underlying a galaxy distribution. The method is based on sampling Gaussian fields which are compatible with a galaxy distribution and a structure formation model. This is achieved by splitting the inversion problem into two Gibbs-sampling steps: the first being a Gaussianisation step transforming a distribution of point sources at Lagrangian positions -which are not a priori given- into a linear alias-free Gaussian field. This step is based on Hamiltonian sampling with a Gaussian-Poisson model. The second step consists on a likelihood comparison in which the set of matter tracers at the initial conditions is constrained on the galaxy distribution and the assumed structure formation model. For computational reasons second order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory is used. However, the presented approach is flexible to adopt any structure formation model. A semi-analytic halo-model based galaxy mock catalog is taken to demonstrate that the recovered initial conditions are closely unbiased with respect to the actual ones from the corresponding N-body simulation down to scales of a ~ 5 Mpc/h. The cross-correlation between them shows a substantial gain of information, being at k ~ 0.3 h/Mpc more than doubled. In addition the initial conditions are extremely well Gaussian distributed and the power-spectra follow the shape of the linear power-spectrum being very close to the actual one from the simulation down to scales of k ~ 1 h/Mpc."

        "Abstract": "A system of N classical particles in a 2D periodic cell interacting via long-range attractive potential is studied. For low energy density $U$ a collapsed phase is identified, while in the high energy limit the particles are homogeneously distributed. A phase transition from the collapsed to the homogeneous state occurs at critical energy U_c. A theoretical analysis within the canonical ensemble identifies such a transition as first order. But microcanonical simulations reveal a negative specific heat regime near $U_c$. The dynamical behaviour of the system is affected by this transition : below U_c anomalous diffusion is observed, while for U > U_c the motion of the particles is almost ballistic. In the collapsed phase, finite $N$-effects act like a noise source of variance O(1/N), that restores normal diffusion on a time scale diverging with N. As a consequence, the asymptotic diffusion coefficient will also diverge algebraically with N and superdiffusion will be observable at any time in the limit N \\to \\infty. A Lyapunov analysis reveals that for U > U_c the maximal exponent \\lambda decreases proportionally to N^{-1/3} and vanishes in the mean-field limit. For sufficiently small energy, in spite of a clear non ergodicity of the system, a common scaling law \\lambda \\propto U^{1/2} is observed for any initial conditions."

We test the code by evolving a pair of simple gas disc-halo models, which differ only in the initial temperature of the gas component. The models are similar to the ones considered in the Wang et al. except that here, the halo is live whereas they included the halo as a fixed potential. We find that the basic structural properties of the models, such as the rotation curve and surface density profiles, are well-preserved over 1.5 Gyr. We also construct a Milky Way model that includes thin and thick stellar disc components, a gas disc, a bulge, and a dark halo. Bar formation occurs in all disc-like components at about 1 Gyr. The bar is strongest in the thin disc while the gas disc contains the most prominent spiral features. The length of the bar in our model is comparable to what has been inferred for the Galactic bar."

These observations more than double the number of z>4 radio-loud quasars having X-ray spectroscopic data to seven, which compose a significant subset of a flux-limited sample of z>4 radio-loud quasars. Based on this subset we show some preliminary results on the overall X-ray spectral properties of the sample. Soft X-ray spectral flattening, which is thought to arise from intrinsic X-ray absorption, was found in about half of the sample. We give a preliminary distribution of the absorption column density NH. For those with detected X-ray absorption, the derived NH values fall into a very narrow range (around a few times 10^(22)cm^(-2) for `cold' absorption), suggesting a possible common origin of the absorber. Compared to lower-redshift samples at z<2, there is an extension, or a systematic shift, toward higher values in the intrinsic NH distribution at z>4, and an increase of the fraction of radio-loud quasars showing X-ray absorption toward high redshifts. These results indicate a cosmic evolution effect, which seems to be the strongest at redshifts around 2. The rest frame 1-50keV continua have photon indices with a mean of 1.64 and a standard deviation of 0.11. Variability appears to be common on timescales from a few months to years in the quasar rest-frame, sometimes in both fluxes and spectral slopes."

Many of these tasks are of a categorical prediction variety: given a conditioning context (e.g., an NLI premise), provide a label based on an associated prompt (e.g., an NLI hypothesis). The categorical nature of these tasks has led to common use of a cross entropy log-loss objective during training. We suggest this loss is intuitively wrong when applied to plausibility tasks, where the prompt by design is neither categorically entailed nor contradictory given the context. Log-loss naturally drives models to assign scores near 0.0 or 1.0, in contrast to our proposed use of a margin-based loss. Following a discussion of our intuition, we describe a confirmation study based on an extreme, synthetically curated task derived from MultiNLI. We find that a margin-based loss leads to a more plausible model of plausibility. Finally, we illustrate improvements on the Choice Of Plausible Alternative (COPA) task through this change in loss."

No stationarity assumption is made. However, in order for the theorem to apply, the horizon topology must be unchanging for long enough to admit a certain kind of cross section. We expect this condition is generically satisfied if the topology is unchanging for much longer than the light-crossing time of the black hole. More precisely, let $M$ be a four dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime satisfying the averaged null energy condition, and suppose that the domain of outer communication $\\C_K$ to the future of a cut $K$ of $\\Sm$ is globally hyperbolic. Suppose further that a Cauchy surface $\\Sigma$ for $\\C_K$ is a topological 3-manifold with compact boundary $\\partial\\S$ in $M$, and $\\S'$ is a compact submanifold of $\\bS$ with spherical boundary in $\\S$ (and possibly other boundary components in $M/\\S$).

        "Abstract": "States of a quantum mechanical system are represented by rays in a complex Hilbert space. The space of rays has, naturally, the structure of a K\\\"ahler manifold. This leads to a geometrical formulation of the postulates of quantum mechanics which, although equivalent to the standard algebraic formulation, has a very different appearance. In particular, states are now represented by points of a symplectic manifold (which happens to have, in addition, a compatible Riemannian metric), observables are represented by certain real-valued functions on this space and the Schr\\\"odinger evolution is captured by the symplectic flow generated by a Hamiltonian function. There is thus a remarkable similarity with the standard symplectic formulation of classical mechanics. Features---such as uncertainties and state vector reductions---which are specific to quantum mechanics can also be formulated geometrically but now refer to the Riemannian metric---a structure which is absent in classical mechanics. The geometrical formulation sheds considerable light on a number of issues such as the second quantization procedure, the role of coherent states in semi-classical considerations and the WKB approximation. More importantly, it suggests generalizations of quantum mechanics. The simplest among these are equivalent to the dynamical generalizations that have appeared in the literature. The geometrical reformulation provides a unified framework to discuss these and to correct a misconception. Finally, it also suggests directions in which more radical generalizations may be found."

The precise interplay mechanisms between cancer stem cells and the rest of a tissue are still not elucidated. To shed light on the interactions between stem and non-stem cancer cell populations we develop a two-population mathematical model, which is suitable to describe tumorsphere growth. Both interspecific and intraspecific interactions, mediated by the microenvironment, are included. We show that there is a tipping point, characterized by a transcritical bifurcation, where a purely non-stem cell attractor is replaced by a new attractor that contains both stem and differentiated cancer cells. The model is then applied to describe the outcome of a recent experiment. This description reveals that, while the intraspecific interactions are inhibitory, the interspecific interactions stimulate growth. This can be understood in terms of stem cells needing differentiated cells to reinforce their niches, and phenotypic plasticity favoring the de-differentiation of differentiated cells into cancer stem cells. We posit that this is a consequence of the deregulation of the quorum sensing that maintains homeostasis in healthy tissues."

For this purpose, we use the formalism of combinatorial quantization of Chern-Simons theory, i.e we quantize the algebra of polynomial functions on the space of flat SL(2,C)-connections on a topological surface with punctures. This algebra admits a unitary representation acting on an Hilbert space which consists in wave packets of spin-networks associated to principal unitary representations of the quantum Lorentz group. This representation is constructed using only Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of a tensor product of a finite dimensional representation with a principal unitary representation. The proof of unitarity of this representation is non trivial and is a consequence of properties of intertwiners which are studied in depth. We analyze the relationship between the insertion of a puncture colored with a principal representation and the presence of a world-line of a massive spinning particle in de Sitter space."

        "Title": "Solution of minimum spanning forest problems with reliability  constraints",
        "Abstract": "We propose the reliability constrained k-rooted minimum spanning forest, a relevant optimization problem whose aim is to find a k-rooted minimum cost forest that connects given customers to a number of supply vertices, in such a way that a minimum required reliability on each path between a customer and a supply vertex is satisfied and the cost is a minimum. The reliability of an edge is the probability that no failure occurs on that edge, whereas the reliability of a path is the product of the reliabilities of the edges in such path. The problem has relevant applications in the design of networks, in fields such as telecommunications, electricity and transports. For its solution, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model, and an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic which invokes several shaking and local search operators. Extensive computational tests prove that the metaheuristic can provide good quality solutions in very short computing times."

        "Abstract": "We present sketchhair, a deep learning based tool for interactive modeling of 3D hair from 2D sketches. Given a 3D bust model as reference, our sketching system takes as input a user-drawn sketch (consisting of hair contour and a few strokes indicating the hair growing direction within a hair region), and automatically generates a 3D hair model, which matches the input sketch both globally and locally. The key enablers of our system are two carefully designed neural networks, namely, S2ONet, which converts an input sketch to a dense 2D hair orientation field; and O2VNet, which maps the 2D orientation field to a 3D vector field. Our system also supports hair editing with additional sketches in new views. This is enabled by another deep neural network, V2VNet, which updates the 3D vector field with respect to the new sketches. All the three networks are trained with synthetic data generated from a 3D hairstyle database. We demonstrate the effectiveness and expressiveness of our tool using a variety of hairstyles and also compare our method with prior art."

        "Title": "Spin Profile of Galactic Halos and Disk Formation",
        "Abstract": "We summarize recent developments in the study of the origin of halo spin profiles and preliminary implications on disk formation. The specific angular-momentum distributions within halos in N-body simulations match a universal shape, M(<j) \\propto j/(j_0+j). It is characterized by a power law over most of the mass, and one shape parameter in addition to the spin parameter \\lambda. The angular momentum tends to be aligned throughout the halo and of cylindrical symmetry. Even if angular momentum is conserved during baryonic infall, the resultant disk density profile is predicted to deviate from exponential, with a denser core and an extended tail. A slightly corrected version of the scaling relation due to linear tidal-torque theory is used to explain the origin of a typical power-law profile in shells, j(M) \\propto M^s with s \\gsim 1. While linear theory crudely predicts the amplitudes of halo spins, it is not a good predictor of their directions. Independently, mergers of halos are found to produce a similar profile due to j transfer from the orbit to the product halo via dynamical friction and tidal stripping. The halo spin is correlated with having a recent major merger, though this correlation is weakened by mass loss. These two effects are due to a correlation between the spins of neighboring halos and their orbit, leading to prograde mergers."

        "Abstract": "By adopting a Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) framework, we show that only a handful of costly fine scale computations are needed to accurately estimate statistics of the failure of a composite structure, as opposed to the thousands typically needed in classical Monte Carlo analyses. We introduce the MLMC method, compare its theoretical complexity with classical Monte Carlo, and give a simple-to-implement algorithm which includes a simple extension called MLMC with selective refinement to efficiently calculated structural failure probabilities. To demonstrate the huge computational gains we present two benchmark problems in composites: (1) the effects of fibre waviness on the compressive strength of a composite material, (2) uncertain buckling performance of a composite panel with uncertain ply orientations. For our most challenging test case, estimating a rare ($\\sim 1/150$) probability of buckling failure of a composite panel, we see a speed-up factor $> 1000$. Our approach distributed over $1024$ processors reduces the computation time from $218$ days to just $4.5$ hours. This level of speed up makes stochastic simulations that would otherwise be unthinkable now possible.?"

All modeling assumptions are rigorously explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation. This approach results in a transparent and intuitive model. With respect to the state of the art beam model this paper: (i) proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects, (ii) intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art beam model, and (iii) reduces the number of model parameters, while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data. The proposed beam model is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum likelihood and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization) are proposed to learn the model parameters.   Furthermore, the RBBM is extended to a full scan model in two steps: first, to a full scan model for static environments and next, to a full scan model for general, dynamic environments. The full scan model accounts for the dependency between beams and adapts to the local sample density when using a particle filter. In contrast to Gaussian-based state of the art models, the proposed full scan model uses a sample-based approximation. This sample-based approximation enables handling dynamic environments and capturing multi-modality, which occurs even in simple static environments."

The fields in the theory consist of: a metric on X, a connection on P and a B-field which is, roughly speaking, a two-form on X. As in a gauge theory, these fields are considered up to gauge equivalence. This means that the connection is considered up to bundle isomorphism, that the metric is considered up to diffeomorphism equivalence, and that the two-form B is considered up to equivalence by adding exact two-forms. The fact that B has a gauge invariance implies that it is not in fact a globally defined two-form but rather must be given as a gerbe-like object. The purpose of this paper is to give a precise definition of the mathematical nature of the B-field following the recent work of Freed and then to work out a description of the moduli space of 8-dimensional Euclidean invariant classical solutions to the string Equations of Motion in the case when space-time is compactified along a two-torus."

In the context of rectilinear drawings, the problem is trivial. For pseudolinear drawings, the existence of such an extension follows from Levi's enlargement lemma. In contrast, we prove that deciding if a given set of edges can be inserted into a simple drawing is NP-complete. Moreover, we show that the maximization version of the problem is APX-hard. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether one edge $uv$ can be inserted into $D(G)$ when $\\{u,v\\}$ is a dominating set for the graph $G$."

        "Abstract": "Dimerization of a spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice is investigated for several possible dimerized configurations, some of which are shown to have lower ground state energies than the others. In particular, the lattice deformations resulting in alternate stronger and weaker couplings along both the principal axes of a square lattice are shown to result in a larger gain in magnetic energy. In addition, a `columnar' configuration is shown to have a lower ground state energy and a faster increase in the energy gap parameter than a `staggered' configuration. The inclusion of unexpanded exchange coupling leads to a power law behaviour for the magnetic energy gain and energy gap, which is qualitatively different from that reported earlier. Instead of increasing as $\\delta ^{x}$, the two quantities depend on $\\delta $ as $\\delta ^{\\nu}/| \\ln \\delta | .$ This is true both in the near critical regime $(0\\leq \\delta \\leq 0.1)$ as well as in the far regime $(0\\leq \\delta <1)$. It is suggested that the unexpanded exchange coupling is as much a source of the logarithmic dependence as a correction due to the contribution of umklapp processes. Staggered magnetization is shown to follow the same $\\delta $-dependence in all the configurations in the small $\\delta $-regime, while for $0\\leq \\delta <1$, it follows the power law $\\delta ^{x}$."

The algorithm is local, so is applicable to complicated networks if we are interested only in a part isomorphic to a tree.

We first consider a lens model that consists of a clump modeled as a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and a primary lens modeled as an external background shear and convergence. For this simple model, we derive analytic formulae for (de)magnification of circularly symmetric top-hat sources with three types of parity for their lensed images, namely, positive, negative, and doubly negative parities. Provided that the source size is sufficiently larger than the Einstein radius of the SIS, we find that in the positive (doubly negative) parity case, an extended source is always magnified (demagnified) in comparison with the unperturbed macrolens system, whereas in the negative parity case, the (de)magnification effect, which depends on the sign of convergence minus unity is weaker than those in other parities. It is shown that a measurement of the distortion pattern in a multiply lensed image enables us to break the degeneracy between the lensing effects of clump mass and those of clump distance if lensing parameters of the relevant macrolens model are determined from the position and flux of multiple images. We also show that an actual density profile of a clump can be directly measured by analyzing the ``fine structure'' in a multiply lensed image within the Einstein radius of the clump."

The matching is performed on a space-like hyper-surface identified by the co-moving time at which quantum-gravity induced effects halt collapse. The purpose of the model is to suggest a possible reconciliation between the observation that black holes are well described by the classical solutions and the fact that the theoretical resolution of space-time singularities leads to a bounce for the collapsing matter."

Next, we consider the case where the niche is subject to a displacement, representing the effect of a climate change or of seasonal variation of resources. We find that in such case the presence of the line with fast diffusion can help the population to persist. We also study several qualitative properties of this system.

Giving quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases, it is a candidate for a unified physical theory. The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the so-called causal action principle. The causal action principle does not rely on a presupposed space-time structure. Instead, it is a variational principle for space-time itself as well as for all structures in space-time (like particles, fields, etc.).   After a general motivation and introduction, we report on mathematical results for two-particle causal fermion systems which state that every minimizer describes a discrete space-time. We explain and make precise that on scales which are much larger than the scale of the microscopic space-time structures, the dynamics of a causal fermion system respects causality with a finite speed of propagation."

The problem is split into two subproblems: (a) the scalar source identification, and (b) solution of the divergence equation. For subproblem (a), we design an algorithm for reconstructing the scalar source function, which does not require solving the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. Instead, the problem is reformulated as a linear operator equation, which is solved by a projection method. The dimension of the subspace, in which the source function is sought, is independent of the dimension of the forward problem, leading to reduction of the size of the inverse problem. Numerical experiments with exact and noisy data are presented. For subproblem (b), the divergence equation was posed as a minimization problem, which, by means of Lagrangian formalism, was reduced to a system of partial differential equation of Stokes type with a unique solution. To demonstrate how this framework can be used in a practical application, we implemented the algorithm in the two-dimensional physical space, using a finite-different discretization on staggered grids."

When a suitable $A$-scaffold exists, we show how to answer questions generalizing those of classical integral Galois module theory. We give a necessary and sufficient condition, involving only numerical parameters, for a given fractional ideal to be free over its associated order in $A$. We also show how to determine the number of generators required when it is not free, along with the embedding dimension of the associated order. In the Galois case, the numerical parameters are the ramification breaks associated with $L/K$. We apply these results to biquadratic Galois extensions in characteristic 2, and to totally and weakly ramified Galois $p$-extensions in characteristic $p$.

However, observations between 50 and 300 GeV are rare, and the high-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED), predicted to be in this range, has never been directly detected. We present a detection of Mrk 421 above 100 GeV as made by the Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) during a multiwavelength campaign in early 2004. STACEE is a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescope using the wavefront sampling technique to detect gamma rays at lower energies than achieved by most imaging Cherenkov telescopes.

A critical comparison is done between the Navier-Stokes theory and the predictions obtained from the Boltzmann equation for the profiles of the hydrodynamic quantities and their fluxes. The Navier-Stokes description fails to first order and, especially, to second order in the force. Thus, the hydrostatic pressure is not uniform, the temperature profile exhibits a non-monotonic behavior, a longitudinal component of the flux exists in the absence of longitudinal thermal gradient, and normal stress differences are present. On the other hand, comparison with the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model kinetic equation shows that the latter is able to capture the correct functional dependence of the fields, although the numerical values of the coefficients are in general between 0.38 and 1.38 times the Boltzmann values. A short comparison with the results corresponding to the planar Poiseuille flow is also carried out."

Such procedures, however, cannot be extended in a straightforward manner when a spacetime has multiple horizons. In particular, it is not clear whether there exists a notion of global temperature characterizing the multi-horizon spacetimes. We examine the conditions under which a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using the example of Schwarzschild-De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically extend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor, response of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for identifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the SDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart which covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a consistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS spacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two temperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS spacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational (c) Even when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal nature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate chart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other charts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures. The coordinate dependence of the thermal nature is reminiscent of the flat spacetime in Minkowski and Rindler coordinate charts. The implications are discussed."

A key feature of the LXePET system is the ability to identify individual photon interactions with high energy resolution and high spatial resolution in 3 dimensions and determine the correct interaction sequence using Compton reconstruction algorithms. The simulated LXePET imaging performance was evaluated by computing the noise equivalent count rate, the sensitivity and point spread function for a point source, and by examining the image quality using a micro-Derenzo phantom according to the NEMA-NU4 standard. Results of these simulation studies included NECR peaking at 1326 kcps at 188 MBq (705 kcps at 184 MBq) for an energy window of 450 - 600 keV and a coincidence window of 1 ns for mouse (rat) phantoms.

We investigate a specific transformation of the model parameters based on the multivariate distributional transform. This transformation is a special form of the reparametrization trick, flattens the hierarchy and leads to a standard Gaussian prior on all resulting parameters. The transformation also transfers all the prior information into the structure of the likelihood, hereby decoupling the transformed parameters a priori from each other. A variational Gaussian approximation in this standardized space will be excellent in situations of relatively uninformative data. Additionally, the curvature of the log-posterior is well-conditioned in directions that are weakly constrained by the data, allowing for fast inference in such a scenario. In an example we perform the transformation explicitly for Gaussian process regression with a priori unknown correlation structure. Deep models are inferred rapidly in highly and slowly in poorly informed situations. The flat model show exactly the opposite performance pattern. A synthesis of both, the deep and the flat perspective, provides their combined advantages and overcomes the individual limitations, leading to a faster inference."

We use a Newtonian 3D SPH code, and model the NS with a stiff (index G=3 and G=2.5) polytropic equation of state and the black hole as a Newtonian point mass. Our initial conditions correspond to irrotational binaries in equilibrium (approximating the NS as a compressible ellipsoid), and we have explored configurations with different initial mass ratios, 0.2< q=M_ns/M_bh<0.5. The dynamical evolution is followed for ~23ms. We include gravitational radiation losses in the quadrupole approximation for a point-mass binary. For G=3, after an initial episode of mass transfer, the NS is not completely disrupted and a remnant core remains in orbit about the black hole. For G=2.5 the disruption is more complex, with the NS being totally disrupted during a second periastron passage. The accretion disc formed around the black hole contains ~0.2 solar masses. A nearly baryon-free axis is always present in the system, and only modest beaming of a relativistic fireball that could give rise to a GRB would be sufficient to avoid baryon contamination. Around 0.01 solar masses may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could contribute substantially to the amount of observed galactic r-process material. We calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms in the quadrupole approximation. We also present the results of simulations that have used spherical NSs relaxed in isolation as initial conditions, in order to gauge the effect of using non-equilibrium initial conditions on the coalescence."

        "Abstract": "A stochastic reaction-diffusion model is studied on a networked support. In each patch of the network two species are assumed to interact following a non-normal reaction scheme. When the interaction unit is replicated on a directed linear lattice, noise gets amplified via a self-consistent process which we trace back to the degenerate spectrum of the embedding support. The same phenomenon holds when the system is bound to explore a quasi degenerate network. In this case, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator, which governs species diffusion, accumulate over a limited portion of the complex plane. The larger the network, the more pronounced the amplification. Beyond a critical network size, a system deemed deterministically stable, hence resilient, may turn unstable, yielding seemingly regular patterns in the concentration amount. Non-normality and quasi-degenerate networks may therefore amplify the inherent stochasticity, and so contribute to altering the perception of resilience, as quantified via conventional deterministic methods."

        "Abstract": "We analyze systematic effects in the determination of the galaxy luminosity function in clusters using a deep mock catalogue constructed from a numerical simulation of a hierarchical universe. The results indicate a strong tendency to derive a rising faint end ($\\alpha \\lsim -1.5$) in clusters selected in two dimensions, using a galaxy catalogue constructed with a universal flat luminosity function with $\\alpha \\simeq -1.0$. This is due to the projection effects inherent in catalogues of clusters constructed using 2 dimensional data. Many of the clusters found in 2d have no significant 3d counterparts, and most suffer from massive background contamination that cannot be corrected for by subtracting random offset fields. The luminosity function of high surface brightness galaxies in the field and within small groups follows a Schechter function with a fairly flat faint end slope, $n(L)\\propto L^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha = -0.9$ to -1.2. On the contrary, observational studies of clusters constructed using Abell, EDCC and APM catalogues are systematically found to have steeper luminosity functions with $\\alpha = -1.4$ to -2.0. This may be attributed to projection effects rather than a dominant population of high surface brightness dwarf galaxies ($M\\gsim M^*+2$) in clusters. It should be straighforward to confirm our results by measuring redshifts of these faint cluster galaxies."

As compared to simple liquids, liquid PdNiCuP is characterized by a dense packing with a packing fraction above 0.5. The intermediate scattering function exhibits a fast relaxation process that precedes structural relaxation. Structural relaxation obeys a time-temperature superposition that extends over a temperature range of 540K. The mode-coupling theory of the liquid to glass transition (MCT) gives a consistent description of the dynamics which governs the mass transport in liquid PdNiCuP alloys. MCT scaling laws extrapolate to a critical temperature Tc at about 20% below the liquidus temperature. Diffusivities derived from the mean relaxation times compare well with Co diffusivities from recent tracer diffusion measurements and diffsuivities calculated from viscosity via the Stokes-Einstein relation. In contrast to simple metallic liquids, the atomic transport in dense, liquid PdNiCuP is characterized by a drastical slowing down of dynamics on cooling, a q^{-2} dependence of the mean relaxation times at intermediate q and a vanishing isotope effect as a result of a highly collective transport mechanism. At temperatures as high as 2Tc diffusion in liquid PdNiCuP is as fast as in simple liquids at the melting point. However, the difference in the underlying atomic transport mechanism indicates that the diffusion mechanism in liquids is not controlled by the value of the diffusivity but rather by that of the packing fraction."

These two well-known effects arise from the interaction between a moving atom or detector with a quantum field under some boundary conditions introduced by a conducting mirror/cavity or dielectric wall. The Casimir-Polder force is a retardation force on the atom due to the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic field in the presence of a conducting mirror or dielectric wall. We have recently provided an improved calculation by treating the mutual influence of the atom and the (constrained) field in a self-consistent way. For an atom moving adiabatically, perpendicular to a mirror, our result finds a coherent retardation correction up to twice the stationary value. Unruh effect refers loosely to the fact that a uniformly accelerated detector feels hot. Two prior schemes have been proposed for the detection of `Unruh radiation', based on charged particles in linear accelerators and storage rings. Here we are interested in a third scheme proposed recently by Scully {\\it et al} \\cite{Scully03} involving the injection of accelerated atoms into a microwave or optical cavity. We analyze two main factors instrumental to the purported success in this scheme, the cavity factor and the sudden switch-on factor. We conclude that the effects engendered from these factors are unrelated to the Unruh effect."

Whereas multi-label classification methods seem a natural first resort, they are not readily applicable to set-valued outputs because of the growth rate of the output space; and because conventional sequence generation doesn't reflect sets' order-free nature. In this paper, we propose a unified framework--sequential set generation (SSG)--that can handle output sets of labels and sequences. SSG is a meta-algorithm that leverages any probabilistic learning method for label or sequence prediction, but employs a proper regularization such that a new label or sequence is generated repeatedly until the full set is produced. Though SSG is sequential in nature, it does not penalize the ordering of the appearance of the set elements and can be applied to a variety of set output problems, such as a set of classification labels or sequences. We perform experiments with both benchmark and synthetic data sets and demonstrate SSG's strong performance over baseline methods."

We investigate a common limitation across state-of-the-art SyGuS tools that perform counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We empirically observe that as the expressiveness of the provided grammar increases, the performance of these tools degrades significantly.   We claim that this degradation is not only due to a larger search space, but also due to overfitting. We formally define this phenomenon and prove no-free-lunch theorems for SyGuS, which reveal a fundamental tradeoff between synthesizer performance and grammar expressiveness.   A standard approach to mitigate overfitting in machine learning is to run multiple learners with varying expressiveness in parallel. We demonstrate that this insight can immediately benefit existing SyGuS tools. We also propose a novel single-threaded technique called hybrid enumeration that interleaves different grammars and outperforms the winner of the 2018 SyGuS competition (Inv track), solving more problems and achieving a $5\\times$ mean speedup."

To be specific, the equilibrium condition of a nonlinear financial model is embedded into a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem, which is then transformed to a spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonian with at most two-qubit interactions. The problem is thus equivalent to finding the ground state of an interacting spin Hamiltonian, which can be approximated with a quantum annealer.

Here, we consider ultra-cold atoms bouncing on an oscillating atom mirror and show that the system can spontaneously form a discrete time crystal where the ratio of a period of its motion and a driving period is a rational number.

        "Abstract": "The early work of Lorentz, Abraham and others, evolved through the work of Fokker, Dirac and others to ultimately culminate in the Feynman- Wheeler direct action at a distance theory. However this theory has encountered certain conceptual difficulties like non-locality in time, self force of the electron, pre acceleration and the perfect absorption condition of Feynman and Wheeler, that is the instantaneous action of the remaining charges in the universe on the charge in question. More recently, Hoyle and Narlikar have resurrected this theory, but within the context of a Steady State or Quasi Steady State cosmology. They argue that the theory infact has a better standing than the generally accepted quantum theoretic description. In this article we consider a quantum theoretic description and a cosmology which parallels the Hoyle-Narlikar approach. This leads to a synthesis and justification of the Dirac and Feynman-Wheeler approaches, clarifying the conceptual problems in the process. We deduce a scenario with quantized space-time and a holistic cosmology, consistent with physical and astrophysical data. The non-locality is now seen to be meaningful within the minimum space-time intervals, as also the perfect absorption within the holistic description. Local realism, and the usual causal field theory are seen to have an underpinning of direct action. For example this is brought out by the virtual photons which mediate interactions in Quantum Electro Dynamics, and the emergence of the inverse square law in the above approach from a background Zero Point Field."

In this lecture, the author proposes a new family of closed linkage mechanisms with an arbitrary number of hinges as an extension of a certain Bricard6R.

A shared common ground among systems which successfully achieve this feat is the integration of previously encountered observations into the current state being estimated. This necessitates the use of a memory module for incorporating previously visited states whilst simultaneously offering an internal representation of the observed environment. In this work we develop a memory module which contains rigidly aligned point-embeddings that represent a coherent scene structure acquired from an RGB-D sequence of observations. The point-embeddings are extracted using modern convolutional neural network architectures, and alignment is performed by computing a dense correspondence matrix between a new observation and the current embeddings residing in the memory module. The whole framework is end-to-end trainable, resulting in a recurrent joint optimisation of the point-embeddings contained in the memory. This process amplifies the shared information across states, providing increased robustness and accuracy.

We suggest that the observed transition of a jet boundary shape from a parabolic to a conical form is associated with the flow transiting from the magnetically dominated regime to the energy equipartition between plasma bulk motion and magnetic field. By coupling the unique set of observations available for the jet kinematics, environment and boundary profile with our MHD modelling under assumption on the presence of a dynamically important magnetic field in the M87 jet, we estimate the central black hole mass and spin.

        "Abstract": "We study an incremental redundancy (IR) cooperative coding scheme for wireless networks. To exploit the spatial diversity benefit we propose a cluster-based collaborating strategy for a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel model and based on a network geometric distance profile. Our scheme enhances the network performance by embedding an IR cooperative coding scheme into an existing noncooperative route. More precisely, for each hop, we form a collaborating cluster of M-1 nodes between the (hop) sender and the (hop) destination. The transmitted message is encoded using a mother code and partitioned into M blocks corresponding to the each of M slots. In the first slot, the (hop) sender broadcasts its information by transmitting the first block, and its helpers attempt to relay this message. In the remaining slots, the each of left-over M-1 blocks is sent either through a helper which has successfully decoded the message or directly by the (hop) sender where a dynamic schedule is based on the ACK-based feedback from the cluster. By employing powerful good codes (e.g., turbo codes, LDPC codes, and raptor codes) whose performance is characterized by a threshold behavior, our approach improves the reliability of a multi-hop routing through not only cooperation diversity benefit but also a coding advantage. The study of the diversity and the coding gain of the proposed scheme is based on a new simple threshold bound on the frame-error rate (FER) of maximum likelihood decoding. A average FER upper bound and its asymptotic (in large SNR) version are derived as a function of the average fading channel SNRs and the code threshold."

RXTE also resolves the Fe K-alpha fluorescence line with FWHM ~48,000 km s^{-1}. This measurement provides the first independent confirmation of ASCA detections in Seyfert galaxies of broad Fe K-alpha lines that are thought to be the signature of emission from the inner regions of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole. Under the assumption that reflection arises from an isotropic source located above a neutral accretion disk, and using a theoretical model that accounts for the dependence of the reflected spectrum on inclination angle, we derive a 90% confidence range for the disk inclination of i = 50 to 81 degrees. The large inclination is consistent with that expected from the unified model for MCG-5-23-16 based on its Seyfert 1.9 classification. If we assume that the high-energy cutoff in the incident spectrum lies at energies larger than a few hundred keV, then the equivalent width of the Fe K-alpha line is much larger than predicted for the amount of reflection. This implies either an enhanced iron abundance, a covering factor of reflecting material > 0.5, or a cutoff in the incident spectrum at energies between ~60 and ~200 keV."

        "Abstract": "The light curves from a variety of celestial objects display aperiodic variations, often giving rise to red-noise components in their power spectra. Searching for a narrow power spectrum peak resulting from a periodic modulation over the frequency range in which ``coloured'' noise components are dominant has proven a very complex task. We develop here a technique aimed at detecting periodicities in the presence of ``coloured'' power spectrum components, while mantaining the highest Fourier frequency resolution. First we introduce a simple approximation to the statistical properties of the ``coloured'' power spectra from celestial objects, based on a few examples and the theory of linear processes. We then estimate the continuum components in the power spectrum through an ad hoc smoothing technique. By dividing the sample spectrum by the smoothed one, a white-noise like spectrum is obtained, the approximate probability distribution of which is derived. A search for coherent pulsations is then carried out by looking for peaks in the divided spectrum, the chance probability of which is below a given detection threshold. The technique is tested and its range of applicability determined through extensive numerical simulations. We present also an application to the X-ray light curves of V0332+53, a highly variable accreting X-ray pulsar, and GX13+1, a bright and variable accreting source in the galactic bulge."

        "Abstract": "ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) data have provided another window to search for supernova remnants (SNRs). In reexamining this data archive, a list of unidentified extended X-ray objects have been suggested as promising SNR candidate. However, most of these targets have not yet been fully explored by the state-of-art X-ray observatories. For selecting a pilot target for a long-term identification campaign, we have observed the brightest candidate, G308.3-1.4, with Chandra X-ray observatory. An incomplete shell-like X-ray structure which well-correlated with the radio shell emission at 843 MHz has been revealed. The X-ray spectrum suggests the presence of a shock-heated plasma. All these evidences confirm G308.3-1.4 as a SNR. The brightest X-ray point source detected in this field-of-view is also the one locates closest to the geometrical center of G308.3-1.4, which has a soft spectrum. The intriguing temporal variability and the identification of optical/infrared counterpart rule out the possibility of an isolated neutron star. On the other hand, the spectral energy distribution from Ks band to R band suggests a late-type star. Together with a putative periodicity of \\sim1.4 hrs, the interesting excesses in V, B bands and H-alpha suggest this source as a promising candidate of a compact binary survived in a supernova explosion (SN)."

        "Abstract": "Stochastic mirror descent (SMD) is a fairly new family of algorithms that has recently found a wide range of applications in optimization, machine learning, and control. It can be considered a generalization of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm (SGD), where instead of updating the weight vector along the negative direction of the stochastic gradient, the update is performed in a \"mirror domain\" defined by the gradient of a (strictly convex) potential function. This potential function, and the mirror domain it yields, provides considerable flexibility in the algorithm compared to SGD. While many properties of SMD have already been obtained in the literature, in this paper we exhibit a new interpretation of SMD, namely that it is a risk-sensitive optimal estimator when the unknown weight vector and additive noise are non-Gaussian and belong to the exponential family of distributions. The analysis also suggests a modified version of SMD, which we refer to as symmetric SMD (SSMD). The proofs rely on some simple properties of Bregman divergence, which allow us to extend results from quadratics and Gaussians to certain convex functions and exponential families in a rather seamless way."

        "Abstract": "On 2012 September 30 - October 1 the Earth underwent a two-step geomagnetic storm. We examine the Sun-to-Earth characteristics of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) responsible for the geomagnetic storm with combined heliospheric imaging and in situ observations. The first CME, which occurred on 2012 September 25, is a slow event and shows an acceleration followed by a nearly invariant speed in the whole Sun-Earth space. The second event, launched from the Sun on 2012 September 27, exhibits a quick acceleration, then a rapid deceleration and finally a nearly constant speed, a typical Sun-to-Earth propagation profile for fast CMEs \\citep{liu13}. These two CMEs interacted near 1 AU as predicted by the heliospheric imaging observations and formed a complex ejecta observed at Wind, with a shock inside that enhanced the pre-existing southward magnetic field. Reconstruction of the complex ejecta with the in situ data indicates an overall left-handed flux rope-like configuration, with an embedded concave-outward shock front, a maximum magnetic field strength deviating from the flux rope axis and convex-outward field lines ahead of the shock. While the reconstruction results are consistent with the picture of CME-CME interactions, a magnetic cloud-like structure without clear signs of CME interactions \\citep{lugaz14} is anticipated when the merging process is finished."

We consider a family of commuting Hermitian operators $a(\\Delta)$ indexed by all measurable, relatively compact sets $\\Delta$ in $X$ (a quantum stochastic process over $X$). For such a family, we introduce the notion of a correlation measure. We prove that, if the family of operators possesses a correlation measure which satisfies some condition of growth, then there exists a point process over $X$ having the same correlation measure. Furthermore, the operators $a(\\Delta)$ can be realized as multiplication operators in the $L^2$-space with respect to this point process. In the proof, we utilize the notion of $\\star$-positive definiteness, proposed in [Y. G. Kondratiev and T.\\ Kuna, {\\it Infin. Dimens. Anal. Quantum Probab. Relat. Top.} {\\bf 5} (2002), 201--233]. In particular, our result extends the criterion of existence of a point process from that paper to the case of the topological space $X$, which is a standard underlying space in the theory of point processes. As applications, we discuss particle densities of the quasi-free representations of the CAR and CCR, which lead to fermion, boson, fermion-like, and boson-like (e.g. para-fermions and para-bosons of order 2) point processes.   In particular, we prove that any fermion point process corresponding to a Hermitian kernel may be derived in this way."

In this model, a single star is regarded as a spherical region of a semi-dilute polymer solution with a local, position dependent screening length. For high enough concentrations, the outer sections of the arms overlap and build a semi-dilute solution (a sea of blobs) where the inner parts of the actual stars are embedded. The scattering function is evaluated following a method introduced by Auvray and de Gennes. In the dilute regime there are three regions in the scattering function: the Guinier region (low wave vectors, q R << 1) from where the radius of the star can be extracted; the intermediate region (1 << q R << f^(2/5)) that carries the signature of the form factor of a star with f arms: I(q) ~ q^(-10/3); and a high wavevector zone (q R >> f^(2/5)) where the local swollen structure of the polymers gives rise to the usual q^(-5/3) decay. In the semi-dilute regime the different stars interact strongly, and the scattered intensity acquires two new features: a liquid peak that develops at a reciprocal position corresponding to the star-star distances; and a new large wavevector contribution of the form q^(-5/3) originating from the sea of blobs."

        "Abstract": "We present a simple agent-based model of a financial system composed of leveraged investors such as banks that invest in stocks and manage their risk using a Value-at-Risk constraint, based on historical observations of asset prices. The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low, leverage is high and vice versa, a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical leverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in which gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic market collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using simplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the nature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle. We introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to continuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the policy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the endogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there is always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable, countercyclical leverage can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the impact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness via the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator relaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and tightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the amplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the choice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show how they can control the leverage cycle."

        "Abstract": "We present a deep X-ray observation of the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in NGC4258 (M106) using ASCA. The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

Our approach is (1) to examine the observed projected rotational velocities among a large sample of newly-formed stars spanning a range in mass between 0.2 and 50 M ; and (2) to search for evidence of a discontinuity in rotational properties that might indicate a difference in the stellar formation process at some characteristic mass. Our database includes both recently published values of v sin i for young intermediate- and low- mass stars in Orion, as well as new observations of O stars located in young clusters and OB associations. We find that the median of the quantity v_obs/v_c (observed rotational speed/equatorial breakup velocity) is typically about 0.15 and shows no evidence of a discontinuity over the full range of stellar masses, while the quantity Jsini/M (derived angular momentum per unit mass) exhibits a slow, monotonic rise with increasing mass with no evidence of a discontinuity. We suggest that these observations are most simply interpreted as indicative of a single stellar formation and angular momentum regulation mechanism: one that results in rotation rates well below breakup, and angular momenta per unit mass that differ systematically by no more than a factor of 3-4 over a mass range spanning a factor of 250."

        "Abstract": "Images generated by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) can depict highly ambiguous features that are difficult to interpret correctly. One possible solution to this problem is to reconstruct the so-called exit wave, i.e. the electron wave in the microscope right before it passes the objective lens, from a series of TEM images acquired with varying focus. While the forward model of simulating a TEM image from a given exit wave is known and easy to evaluate, it is in general not possible to reconstruct the exit wave from a series of images analytically. The corresponding inverse problem can be formulated as a minimization problem, which is done in the well known MAL and MIMAP methods. We propose a generalization of the MAL algorithm by performing the exit wave reconstruction and the registration of the image series simultaneously. We show that our objective functional is not convex with respect to the exit wave, which also carries over to the MAL functional. The main result is the existence of minimizers of our objective functional. These results are based on the properties of a generalization of the cross-correlation. Finally, the applicability of our method is verified with a numerical experiment on simulated input data."

A promising structure for this end is a topological one-dimensional (1D) channel formed in bilayer graphene (BLG) under special electrostatic conditions or specific stacking configuration, called domain wall (DW). In these 1D channels, the valley-index defines the propagation direction of the charge carriers and the chiral edge states (kink states) are robust over many kinds of disorder. However, the fabrication of DWs is challenging, requiring the design of complex multi-gate structures or have been producing on rough substrates, showing a limited mean free path. Here, we report on a high-quality DW formed at the curved boundary of folded bilayer graphene (folded-BLG). At such 1D conducting channel we measured a two-terminal resistance close to the quantum resistance $R = e^2/4h$ at zero magnetic field, a signature of kink states. Our experiments reveal a long-range ballistic transport regime that occurs only at the DW of the folded-BLG, while the other regions behave like semiconductors with tunable band gap."

By fitting a 6' (~360 h_50^-1 kpc) region with a single Mewe-Kaastra-Liedahl model with photoelectric absorption, we find a temperature of 2.1 - 2.3 keV, and abundance of 0.45 - 0.77 (both 90% confidence). We find the addition of a power-law component provides a statistically significant improvement (F-test = 90%) to the fit. The addition of a second thermal component also improves the fit but we argue that it is physically implausible. The power-law component has a photon index (Gamma_X) of 0.4 - 2.8 and a nonthermal flux of (4.1 - 56.7) x 10-5 photons cm^-2 s^-1 over the 1.5 - 10.5 keV range in the Medium Energy Concentrator spectrometer detector. An unidentified X-ray source found in the ROSAT High Resolution Imager observation (~0'.9 from the center of the cluster) is a possible explanation for the nonthermal flux; however, additional evidence of diffuse, nonthermal emission comes from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey radio measurements, in which excess diffuse, radio flux is observed after point-source subtraction. The radio excess can be fitted to a simple power law with a spectral index of ~1.8, which is consistent with the nonthermal X-ray emission spectral index. The steep spectrum is typical of diffuse emission and the size of the radio source implies that it is larger than the cD galaxy and not due to a discreet source."

Compared to the well-studied case of sedimenting rigid rods, the introduction of filament compliance is shown to cause a significant alteration in the long-time sedimentation orientation and filament geometry. A model is developed by balancing viscous, elastic, and gravitational forces in a slender-body theory for zero-Reynolds-number flows, and the filament dynamics are characterized by a dimensionless elasto-gravitation number. Filaments of both non-uniform and uniform cross-sectional thickness are considered. In the weakly flexible regime, a multiple-scale asymptotic expansion is used to obtain expressions for filament translations, rotations, and shapes. These are shown to match excellently with full numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that trajectories of sedimenting flexible filaments, unlike their rigid counterparts, are restricted to a cloud whose envelope is determined by the elasto-gravitation number. In the highly flexible regime we show that a filament sedimenting along its long axis is susceptible to a buckling instability. A linear stability analysis provides a dispersion relation, illustrating clearly the competing effects of the compressive stress and the restoring elastic force in the buckling process. The instability travels as a wave along the filament opposite the direction of gravity as it grows and the predicted growth rates are shown to compare favorably with numerical simulations. The linear eigenmodes of the governing equation are also studied, which agree well with the finite-amplitude buckled shapes arising in simulations."

A MOF usually consists of a hexagonal arrangement of air holes running down the length of a silica fiber surrounding a central core of solid silica or, in some cases air. MOFs can exhibit a number of unique properties, including zero dispersion at visible wavelengths and low or high effective nonlinearity [3]-[17], By varying the size of the holes and their number and position, one can also design MOFs with carefully controlled dispersive and modal properties. In this paper, we analyze and modeling the behavior of the photonic crystal fiber (PCF) by using in the first step a propagator method based on the BPM method. With our BPM software, the electric field contour of the fundamental mode of PCF was demonstrated. We also used it to see the variation of the effective index; an effective index model confirms that such a fiber can be single mode for any wavelength. It would make a study of photonic crystal fibers, and a study of the numerical simulation methods allow the simulation of optical properties and has modeled the propagation of light in this fiber type. After that we use the V-parameter because it offers a simple way to design a photonic crystal fiber (PCF), by basing in a recent formulation of this parameter of a PCF, we provide numerically based empirical expression for this quantity only dependent on the two structural parameters, the air hole diameter and the hole-to-hole center spacing."

The map is embedded into a continuous unitary transformation generated by a time-independent quasi-Hamiltonian. Such a Hamiltonian generates at the very point of the resonance a local gauge transformation described the unitary unimodular group SU(q). The resonant energy growth of is attributed to the zero Liouville eigenmodes of the generator in the adjoint representation of the group while the non-zero modes yield saturating with time contribution. In a vicinity of a given resonance, the quasi-Hamiltonian is then found in the form of power expansion with respect to the detuning from the resonance. The problem is related in this way to the motion along a circle in a (q^2-1)-component inhomogeneous \"magnetic\" field of a quantum particle with $q$ intrinsic degrees of freedom described by the SU(q) group. This motion is in parallel with the classical phase oscillations near a non-linear resonance. The most important role is played by the resonances with the orders much smaller than the typical localization length, q << l. Such resonances master for exponentially long though finite times the motion in some domains around them. Explicit analytical solution is possible for a few lowest and strongest resonances."

        "Abstract": "Models of Gauge-Higgs unification in extra dimensions offer a very elegant playground where one can study electroweak symmetry breaking. The nicest feature is that gauge symmetry itself protects the Higgs potential from divergences, thus potentially curing the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model. In a flat space model tree-level contributions to electroweak precision observables will be absent due to the flatness of the gauge and Higgs wave functions. The Higgs potential is fully radiatively generated and the contribution of bulk fermions will induce a vacuum expectation value. A generic problem is that the quartic scalar coupling is too low, resulting in a Higgs VEV that is too close to the compactification scale, and a Higgs mass that is too light. In this paper we show that it is possible to solve these problems in a minimal scenario by cancellations in the Higgs potential between the contribution of different bulk fermions. A crucial role is played by antiperiodic fermions: the cancellation is not the result of a fine tuning, but rather dictated by the choice of representations and parities of the fermions. We also show that introducing a relatively large representation can help in achieving a sufficiently heavy top. In this case, the strong coupling scale is lowered to a marginally acceptable value, and a more careful analysis of two loop effects should decide if the theory remains under perturbative control."

The optical network units (ONUs), being predominantly responsible for the energy consumption of Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON), motivates us towards designing a novel protocol for saving energy at ONU. The proposed protocol exploits different low power modes (LPM) and opts for the suitable one using traffic prediction. This scheme provides a significant improvement of energy-efficiency especially at high load (~ 40%) over existing protocols. A better understanding of the performance and a deeper insight into several design aspects can only be addressed through a detailed mathematical analysis. The proposed protocol involves traffic prediction which infringes Markovian property. However, some pragmatic assumptions along with a proper selection of observation instances and state descriptions allow us to form a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) of the proposed algorithm. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to propose a novel scheme for achieving energy-efficiency at ONU and mathematically analyze the performance of it with the help of a DTMC. The analysis reveals that the energy-efficiency is more sensitive to the power consumption of doze mode as compared to other LPM while the effect of sleep-to-wake-up time is minor."

We define a notion of a commutative algebra object in a coboundary category, and we prove that the quantum symmetric algebra of a module is the universal commutative algebra generated by that module. That is, the functor assigning to a module its quantum symmetric algebra is left adjoint to a forgetful functor. We also prove a conjecture of Berenstein and Zwicknagl, stating that the quantum symmetric and exterior cubes exhibit the same amount of \"collapsing\" relative to their classical counterparts. We prove that those quantum exterior algebras that are flat deformations of their classical analogues are Frobenius algebras. We also develop a rigorous framework for discussing continuity and limits of the structures involved as the deformation parameter q varies along the positive real line.   The second part deals with quantum analogues of Clifford algebras and their application to the noncommutative geometry of certain quantum homogeneous spaces. We introduce the quantum Clifford algebra through its spinor representation via creation and annihilation operators on one of the flat quantum exterior algebras discussed in the first part. The proof that the spinor representation is irreducible relies on the Frobenius property discussed previously. We use this quantum Clifford algebra to revisit Krahmer's construction of a Dolbeault-Dirac-type operator on a quantized irreducible flag manifold. This operator is of the form $d+d^*$, and we relate $d$ to the boundary operator for the Koszul complex of a certain quantum symmetric algebra, which shows that $d^2=0$.

The precession of the test gyroscope gives the signatures of the general relativistic effects that are present in the region of strong gravity of an NS. Using a numerical code, we find the precession of the test gyroscope for a rotating and a strongly magnetized neutron star. The magnetic field distribution inside the neutron star is assumed either to be poloidal or toroidal. The overall spin precession rate is obtained by setting the orbital frequency of the gyroscope to a non-zero value but restricted to a time-like observer. The gyro frequency differs depending on the central object being a black hole or a neutron star. For neutron star, the gyro precession can even be calculated inside the star. We find that the gyroscope precession frequency depends on the stars mass, rotation rate, and magnetic field configuration."

Here, we propose a method for addressing qubits using a method that combines spatial and spectral selectivity. The result is a design for quantum computation that provides the potential for a density of quantum information storage and processing many orders of magnitude greater than that afforded by ion traps or NMR. Specifically, this method uses an ensemble of spectrally resolved atoms in a spectral holeburning solid. The quantum oupling is provided by strong atom-cavity interaction. Using a thin disc of diamond containing nitrogen-vacancy color centers as an example, we present an explicit model for realizing up to 300 coupled qubits in a single spot. We show how about 100 operations can take place in parallel, yielding close to 40,000 operations before decoherence."

        "Abstract": "TeV gamma-rays from the BL Lac object 1ES1959+650 have been measured during the years 2000 and 2001 with a significance of 5.2 sigma at a value of 5.3% of the Crab flux and in May 2002 during strong outbursts with > 23 sigma at a flux level of up to 2.2 Crab, making 1ES1959+650 the TeV Blazar with the third best event statistics. The deep observation of 197.4 h has been performed with the HEGRA stereoscopic system of 5 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT system). 1ES1959+650 is located at a redshift of z = 0.047, providing an intermediate distance between the nearby Blazars Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, and the much more distant object H1426+428. This makes 1ES1959+650 an important member of the class of TeV Blazars in view of the absorption of TeV photons by the diffuse extragalactic background radiation (DEBRA). The differential energy spectrum of 1ES1959+650 during the flares can be fitted by a power law with a spectral index of 2.83 +- 0.14_stat +- 0.08_sys or by a power law with an exponential cut-off at (4.2^(+0.8)_(-0.6)_stat +- 0.9_sys) TeV and a spectral index of 1.83 +- 0.15_stat +- 0.08_sys. The low state differential energy spectrum obtained with lower statistics can be described by a pure power law with a spectral index of 3.18 +- 0.17_stat +- 0.08_sys."

        "Abstract": "Two Fokker actions and corresponding equations of motion are obtained for two point particles in a post-Minkowski framework, in which the field of each particle is given by the half-retarded + half-advanced solution to the linearized Einstein equations. The first action is parametrization invariant, the second a generalization of the affinely parametrized quadratic action for a relativistic particle. Expressions for a conserved 4-momentum and angular momentum tensor are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in this post-Minkowski approximation. A formal solution to the equations of motion is found for a binary system with circular orbits. For a bound system of this kind, the post-Minkowski solution is a toy model that omits nonlinear terms of relevant post-Newtonian order; and we also obtain a Fokker action that is accurate to first post-Newtonian order, by adding to the post-Minkowski action a term cubic in the particle masses. Curiously, the conserved energy and angular momentum associated with the Fokker action are each finite and well-defined for this bound 2-particle system despite the fact that the total energy and angular momentum of the radiation field diverge. Corresponding solutions and conserved quantities are found for two scalar charges (for electromagnetic charges we exhibit the solution found by Schild). For a broad class of parametrization-invariant Fokker actions and for the affinely parametrized action, binary systems with circular orbits satisfy the relation $dE = \\Omega dL$ (a form of the first law of thermodynamics), relating the energy, angular velocity and angular momentum of nearby equilibrium configurations."

        "Abstract": "From the microscopic theory, we derive a number conserving quantum kinetic equation, valid for a dilute Bose gas at any temperature, in which the binary collisions between the quasi-particles are mediated by phonon-like excitations (called ``condenson''). This different approach starts from the many-body Hamiltonian of a Boson gas and uses, in an appropriate way, the generalized random phase approximation. As a result, the collision term of the kinetic equation contains higher order contributions in the expansion in the interaction parameter. This different expansion shows up that a scattering involves the emission and the absorption of a phonon-like excitation. The major interest of this particular mechanism is that, in a regime where the condensate is stable, the collision process between condensed and non condensed particles is totally blocked due to a total annihilation of the mutual interaction potential induced by the condensate itself. As a consequence, the condensate is not constrained to relax and can be superfluid. Furthermore, a Boltzmann-like H-theorem for the entropy exists for this equation and allows to distinguish between dissipative and non dissipative phenomena (like vortices). We also illustrate the analogy between this approach and the kinetic theory for a plasma, in which the excitations correspond precisely to a plasmon. Finally, we show the equivalence of this theory with the non-number conserving Bogoliubov theory at zero temperature."

        "Abstract": "(abridged) We firstly present the results of X-ray spectroscopic observations with XMM-Newton for four high-redshift radio-loud quasars at z>4. These observations more than double the number of z>4 radio-loud quasars having X-ray spectroscopic data to seven, which compose a significant subset of a flux-limited sample of z>4 radio-loud quasars. Based on this subset we show some preliminary results on the overall X-ray spectral properties of the sample. Soft X-ray spectral flattening, which is thought to arise from intrinsic X-ray absorption, was found in about half of the sample. We give a preliminary distribution of the absorption column density NH. For those with detected X-ray absorption, the derived NH values fall into a very narrow range (around a few times 10^(22)cm^(-2) for `cold' absorption), suggesting a possible common origin of the absorber. Compared to lower-redshift samples at z<2, there is an extension, or a systematic shift, toward higher values in the intrinsic NH distribution at z>4, and an increase of the fraction of radio-loud quasars showing X-ray absorption toward high redshifts. These results indicate a cosmic evolution effect, which seems to be the strongest at redshifts around 2. The rest frame 1-50keV continua have photon indices with a mean of 1.64 and a standard deviation of 0.11. Variability appears to be common on timescales from a few months to years in the quasar rest-frame, sometimes in both fluxes and spectral slopes."

There is also a notion of a \"Fourier transform\" on the space of functions $\\Uch(W) \\to \\RR$, due to Lusztig for Weyl groups and to Brou\\'e, Lusztig, and Malle in the remaining cases. This paper concerns a certain $W$-representation $\\varrho_{W}$ in the vector space generated by the involutions of $W$. Our main result is to show that the irreducible multiplicities of $\\varrho_W$ are given by the Fourier transform of a unique function $\\epsilon : \\Uch(W) \\to \\{-1,0,1\\}$, which for various reasons serves naturally as a heuristic definition of the Frobenius-Schur indicator on $\\Uch(W)$. The formula we obtain for $\\epsilon$ extends prior work of Casselman, Kottwitz, Lusztig, and Vogan addressing the case in which $W$ is a Weyl group. We include in addition a succinct description of the irreducible decomposition of $\\varrho_W$ derived by Kottwitz when $(W,S)$ is classical, and prove that $\\varrho_{W}$ defines a Gelfand model if and only if $(W,S)$ has type $A_n$, $H_3$, or $I_2(m)$ with $m$ odd. We show finally that a conjecture of Kottwitz connecting the decomposition of $\\varrho_W$ to the left cells of $W$ holds in all non-crystallographic types, and observe that a weaker form of Kottwitz's conjecture holds in general. In giving these results, we carefully survey the construction and notable properties of the set $\\Uch(W)$ and its attached Fourier transform."

RDCS J0910+5422 was selected as an X-ray cluster candidate in the ROSAT Deep Cluster Survey on the basis of its spatial extent in a Rosat PSPC image. Deep optical and near-IR imaging reveal a red galaxy overdensity around the peak of the X-ray emission, with a significant excess of objects with J-K and I-K colors typical of elliptical galaxies at z ~ 1.0. Spectroscopic observations at the Keck II telescope secured 9 galaxy redshifts in the range 1.095<z<1.120 yielding a mean cluster redshift of <z>=1.106. Eight of these galaxies lie within a 30 arcsec radius around the peak X-ray emission. A deep Chandra ACIS exposure on this field shows extended X-ray morphology and allows the X-ray spectrum of the intracluster medium to be measured. The cluster has a bolometric luminosity L_x = 2.48^{+0.33}_{-0.26} x 10^44 ergs/s, a temperature of kT = 7.2^{+2.2}_{-1.4} keV, and a mass within r = 1 Mpc of 7.0 x 10^14 M_sun (H_0=65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, and Lambda = 0.7). The spatial distribution of the cluster members is elongated, which is not due to an observational selection effect, and followed by the X-ray morphology. The X-ray surface brightness profile and the spectrophotometric properties of the cluster members suggest that this is an example of a massive cluster in an advanced stage of formation with a hot ICM and an old galaxy population already in place at z > 1."

However, previous research on such classification tasks using convolutional neural networks primarily determine a diagnosis for a single magnification level. In this paper, we propose a case-based approach using deep residual neural networks for histopathological malignancy diagnosis, where a case is defined as a sequence of images from the patient at all available levels of magnification. Effectively, through mimicking what a human expert would actually do, our approach makes a diagnosis decision based on features learned in combination at multiple magnification levels. Our results show that the case-based approach achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on BreaKHis, a histopathological image dataset for breast tumors."

Control actions are then selected from a dense control set according to an objective function that rewards improvements in matching the dataset while also encouraging sparsity. This method is evaluated across several experiments involving real and synthetic datasets, and it is shown to generate smaller control sets when compared to the previous state-of-the-art lattice control set computation technique, with these smaller control sets maintaining a high degree of manoeuvrability in the required task. This results in a planning time speedup of up to 4.31x when using the learned control set over the state-of-the-art computed control set. In addition, we show the learned control sets are better able to capture the driving style of the dataset in terms of path curvature."

Driven by the fact that the inverse dynamics can be described as a polynomial function on a suitable input space, we propose the use of a novel kernel, called Geometrically Inspired Polynomial Kernel (GIP). The resulting estimator behaves similarly to model based approaches as concerns data efficiency. Indeed, we proved that the GIP kernel defines a finite dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space that contains the inverse dynamics function computed through the Rigid Body Dynamics. The proposed kernel is based on the recently introduced Multiplicative Polynomial Kernel, a redefinition of the classical polynomial kernel equipped with a set of parameters which allows for an higher regularization. We tested the proposed approach in a simulated environment, and also in real experiments with a UR10 robot. The obtained results confirm that, compared to other data driven estimators, the proposed approach is more data efficient and exhibits better generalization properties. Instead, with respect to model based estimators, our approach requires less prior information and is not affected by model bias."

At each time step either an already-nucleated seed can increase in size, or a new seed may be nucleated. We incorporate a parameter $m$, to describe the relative rates of growth to nucleation. We solve the model analytically to obtain gap size distribution function and a general expression for the jamming coverage as a function of $m$. We show that the jamming coverage $\\theta(m)$ reaches its maximum value $\\theta(m)=1$ in the limit $m\\rightarrow \\infty$ following a power-law $\\theta(\\infty) - \\theta(m) \\sim m^{-1/2}$.

It generates anisotropic adaptive meshes as quasi-uniform ones in some metric space, with the metric tensor being computed based on hierarchical a posteriori error estimates. A global hierarchical error estimate is employed in this study to obtain reliable directional information of the solution. Instead of solving the global error problem exactly, which is costly in general, we solve it iteratively using the symmetric Gauss--Seidel (GS) method. Numerical results show that a few GS iterations are sufficient for obtaining a reasonably good approximation to the error for use in anisotropic mesh adaptation. The new method is compared with several strategies using local error estimators or recovered Hessians. Numerical results are presented for a selection of test examples and a mathematical model for heat conduction in a thermal battery with large orthotropic jumps in the material coefficients."

This model considers that tumor-induced alteration of microenvironmental pH provides a mechanism for cancer invasion. A coupled system reaction-diffusion describing this model is given by three partial differential equations for the 2D non-dimensional spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the density of normal tissue, the neoplastic tissue growth and the excess concentration of H+ ions. Each of the model parameters has a corresponding biological interpretation, for instance, the growth rate of neoplastic tissue, the diffusion coefficient, the re-absorption rate and the destructive influence of H+ ions in the healthy tissue. After solving the direct problem, we propose a model for the estimation of parameters by fitting the numerical solution with real data, obtained via in vitro experiments and fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy. We define an appropriate functional to compare both the real data and the numerical solution using the adjoint method for the minimization of this functional. We apply a splitting strategy joint with Adaptive Finite Element Method (AFEM) to solve the direct problem and the adjoint problem.

In this review we present a detailed theoretical investigation of the optical properties of Skyrmions. Our results provide means for the optical detection of Skyrmions using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. We first consider the optical properties of Skyrmions in disordered systems. A calculation of the luminescence energy reveals a special optical signature which allows us to distinguish between Skyrmions and ordinary electrons. Two experiments to measure the optical signature are proposed. We then turn to the optical properties of Skyrmions in pure systems. We show that, just like an ordinary electron, a Skyrmion may bind with a hole to form a Skyrmionic exciton. The Skyrmionic exciton can have a lower energy than the ordinary magnetoexciton. The optical signature of Skyrmions is found to be a robust feature of the PL spectrum in both disordered and pure systems."

When used in rotating devices of this kind, however, the YBCO can be subjected to both transient and alternating magnetic fields that are not parallel to the direction of magnetization and which have a detrimental effect on the trapped field. These effects may lead to a long-term decay of the magnetization of the bulk sample. In the present work, we analyze both experimentally and numerically the remagnetization process of a melt-processed YBCO single domain that has been partially demagnetized by a magnetic field applied orthogonal to the initial direction of trapped flux. Magnetic torque measurements are used as a tool to probe changes in the remanent magnetization during various sequences of applied field. The application of a small magnetic field between the transverse cycles parallel to the direction of original magnetization results in partial remagnetization of the sample. Rotating the applied field, however, is found to be much more efficient at remagnetizing the bulk material than applying a magnetizing field pulse of the same amplitude. The principal features of the experimental data can be reproduced qualitatively using a two-dimensional finite-element numerical model based on an E-J power law. Finally, the remagnetization process is shown to result from the complex modification of current distribution within the cross-section of the bulk sample."

We study its dynamics following an excitation-phonon (qubit-resonator) interaction quench using a numerically exact approach based on a Chebyshev-moment expansion of the time-evolution operator of the system. We thereby glean heretofore unavailable insights into the process of the small-polaron formation resulting from strongly momentum-dependent excitation-phonon interactions, most prominently about its inherent dynamical timescale. To further characterize this complex process, we evaluate the excitation-phonon entanglement entropy and show that initially prepared bare-excitation Bloch states here dynamically evolve into small-polaron states that are close to being maximally entangled. Finally, by computing the dynamical variances of the phonon position and momentum quadratures, we demonstrate a pronounced non-Gaussian character of the latter states, with a strong antisqueezing in both quadratures."

In such a system the solute dissociates completely into two species of ions with unlike charges. The mathematical description consists of a diffusion equation for each species augmented by transport due to a self consistent electrostatic field determined by the Poisson equation. This mathematical framework also describes other important problems in physics such as electron and hole diffusion across semi-conductor junctions and the diffusion of ions in plasmas. If concentrations do not vary appreciably over distances of the order of the Debye length, the Poisson equation can be replaced by the condition of local charge neutrality first introduced by Planck. It can then be shown that both species diffuse at the same rate with a common diffusivity that is intermediate between that of the slow and fast species (ambipolar diffusion). Here we derive a more general theory by exploiting the ratio of Debye length to a characteristic length scale as a small asymptotic parameter. It is shown that the concentration of either species may be described by a nonlinear integro-differential equation which replaces the classical linear equation for ambipolar diffusion but reduces to it in the appropriate limit. Through numerical integration of the full set of equations it is shown that this nonlinear equation provides a better approximation to the exact solution than the linear equation it replaces."

There have remained fundamental questions whether geometrical frustration preventing magnetic long-range order can induce quantum critical phenomena and how novel they are. Here, we employ a magnetic field angle as a tuning parameter and provide thermodynamic evidence for novel quantum criticality not only driven but also augmented by frustration in the quasi-kagome Kondo-lattice CeRhSn. The field-angle-resolved landscape of the entropy reveals the existence of a quantum critical line under a magnetic field, exactly parallel to the quasi-kagome plane. In particular, on this line, we observe a two-step decrease of the entropy accompanied by a qualitative change in the non-Fermi-liquid behavior. These results suggest that a partial release of frustration induces a quantum critical \"phase\", whose nature is distinctly different from the zero-field one."

The model is fixed solely by the variance of kappa, which in turn is fixed by the amplitude of the power spectrum, sigma_8. We test the PDF against a high resolution Tree-Particle-Mesh simulation and find that it is far superior to the Gaussian or the lognormal, especially for small values of theta << 1 arcmin and at large values of kappa relevant to strong lensing. With this model, we predict the probabilities of strong lensing by a single plane or by multiple planes. We find that for theta ~ 10 arcsec, a single plane accounts for almost all (~ 98%) of the strong lensing cases for source redshift unity. However, for a more typical source redshift of 4, about 12% of the strong lensing cases will result from the contribution of a secondary clump of matter along the line of sight, introducing a systematic error in the determination of the surface density of clusters, typically overestimating it by about 2-5%. We also find that matter inhomogenieties introduce a dispersion in the value of the angular diameter distance about its cosmological mean. The probable error relative to the mean increases with redshift to a value of about 8% for z ~ 6 and theta ~ 10 arcsec."

From an algorithmic perspective, we adopt a local algorithm as a linear approximate solver to find $z$-matchings on general bipartite graphs, whose basic component is a generalized version of the greedy leaf removal procedure in graph theory. From an analytical perspective, in the case of random bipartite graphs with the same size of two types of vertices, we develop a mean-field theory for the percolation phenomenon underlying the local algorithm, leading to a theoretical estimation of $z$-matching sizes on coreless graphs.

The involution and the C*-norm of the C*-algebra of ''compact'' module operators on a Hilbert C*-module allow to recover its original C*-valued inner product up to the following equivalence relation: <.,.>_1 \\sim <.,.>_2 if and only if there exists an invertible, positive element $a$ of the center of the multiplier C*-algebra M(A) of A such that the identity <.,.>_1 \\equiv a \\cdot <.,.>_2 holds."

        "Title": "Learning a Multi-Modal Policy via Imitating Demonstrations with Mixed  Behaviors",
        "Abstract": "We propose a novel approach to train a multi-modal policy from mixed demonstrations without their behavior labels. We develop a method to discover the latent factors of variation in the demonstrations. Specifically, our method is based on the variational autoencoder with a categorical latent variable. The encoder infers discrete latent factors corresponding to different behaviors from demonstrations. The decoder, as a policy, performs the behaviors accordingly. Once learned, the policy is able to reproduce a specific behavior by simply conditioning on a categorical vector. We evaluate our method on three different tasks, including a challenging task with high-dimensional visual inputs. Experimental results show that our approach is better than various baseline methods and competitive with a multi-modal policy trained by ground truth behavior labels."

        "Title": "Transport in topological insulator nanowires",
        "Abstract": "In this chapter we review our work on the theory of quantum transport in topological insulator nanowires. We discuss both normal state properties and superconducting proximity effects, including the effects of magnetic fields and disorder. Throughout we assume that the bulk is insulating and inert, and work with a surface-only theory. The essential transport properties are understood in terms of three special modes: in the normal state, half a flux quantum along the length of the wire induces a perfectly transmitted mode protected by an effective time reversal symmetry; a transverse magnetic field induces chiral modes at the sides of the wire, with different chiralities residing on different sides protecting them from backscattering; and, finally, Majorana zero modes are obtained at the ends of a wire in a proximity to a superconductor, when combined with a flux along the wire. Some parts of our discussion have a small overlap with the discussion in the review [Bardarson and Moore, Rep. Prog. Phys., 76, 056501, (2013)]. We do not aim to give a complete review of the published literature, instead the focus is mainly on our own and directly related work."

By a recent result of Swartz, our pseudotriangulations of $L(kq+1, q)$ are facet minimal when $kq+1$ are even. In 1979, Gagliardi found presentations of the fundamental group of a manifold $M$ in terms of a contracted pseudotriangulation of $M$. Our construction is the converse of this, namely, given a presentation of the fundamental group of a 3-manifold $M$, we construct a contracted pseudotriangulation of $M$. So, our construction of a contracted pseudotriangulation of a 3-manifold $M$ is based on a presentation of the fundamental group of $M$ and it is computer-free."

We analyze the local and global obstructions and give a complete solution to the problem for regular maps. We establish that these can always be smoothly diagonalized locally and that the obstructions to doing this globally are non-trivial Weyl group and torus bundles on $M$. We show how the patching of local diagonalizing maps gives rise to non-trivial $T$-bundles, explain the relation to winding numbers of maps into $G/T$ and restrictions of the structure group and examine the behaviour of gauge fields under this diagonalization. We also discuss the complications that arise for non-regular maps and in the presence of non-trivial $G$-bundles. In particular, we establish a relation between the existence of regular sections of a non-trivial adjoint bundle and restrictions of the structure group of a principal $G$-bundle to $T$. We use these results to justify a Weyl integral formula for functional integrals which, as a novel feature not seen in the finite-dimensional case, contains a summation over all those topological $T$-sectors which arise as restrictions of a trivial principal $G$ bundle and which was used previously to solve completely Yang-Mills theory and the $G/G$ model in two dimensions."

        "Abstract": "The rather wide-spread belief that cosmological expansion of a flat 3D--space (with spatial curvature k=0) cannot be observationally distinguished from a kinematics of galaxies moving in a flat and non-expanding space is erroneous. We suggest that the error may have its source in a non relativistic intuition that imagines the Universe not as a spacetime but separates space from time and pictures the cosmological expansion as space evolving in time. The physical reality, however, is fundamentally different -- the expanding Universe is necessarily a curved spacetime. We show here that the fact that the spacetime is curved implies that the interpretation of the observed cosmological redshift as being due to the expansion of the cosmological 3D--space is observationally verifiable. Thus it is impossible to mimic the true cosmological redshift by a Doppler effect caused by motion of galaxies in a non-expanding 3D-space, flat or curved. We summarize our points in simple spacetime diagrams that illustrate a gedanken experiment distinguishing between expansion of space and pure kinematics. We also provide all relevant mathematics. None of the previously published discussions of the issue, including a recent popular Scientific American article, offered a similarly clear way out of the confusion."

Above 40 keV in an air-coupled 2\" x 2\" NaI scintillator, the SiPM dark count rate was reduced by a factor of about 1000 when cooled. Spectroscopic performance when cooled was very similar to a PMT tested in the same setup, and adequate for nuclear spectrsocopy above 25 keV. Originally, water cooling was used but it was replaced by air cooling which is more suitable for a self-contained system, giving the advantage of portability without degrading performance. Straightforward improvements would allow cooling the SiPM to -30 C or below, which would further reduce the dark count rate and extend the spectroscopically useful range to even lower energies. Such a system would be rugged and suitable for field use, for instance for inspection of cargo for gamma ray emissions."

We give a sufficient, and conjecturally necessary, condition for when a transversal matroid is a positroid.

        "Abstract": "Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image domain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these problems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the shape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into difficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example when the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects. Higher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of non-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region topology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary points in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of circular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological, nanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori unknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this report, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee stable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor expansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one of the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In conjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the extraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model outperforms other techniques."

Various noise contributions to the gravimeter are measured and characterized, with the current primary limitation to sensitivity seen to be the intrinsic noise of the interferometry laser itself. In a gravity gradiometer configuration, a differential phase sensitivity of 1.53~rad/$\\sqrt{Hz}$ was achieved at an artificially introduced differential phase of $\\pi/2$~rad.

Merger simulations are carried out using N-body algorithms that can follow the formation and decay of a black-hole binary and its effect on the surrounding stars down to sub-parsec scales. Our initial stellar systems have steep central density cusps similar to those in low-luminosity elliptical galaxies. Formation of a black-hole binary transfers energy to the stars and lowers the central density; continued decay of the binary creates a ~1/r density cusp similar to those observed in bright elliptical galaxies, with a break radius that extends well beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the black holes. The decay of the black hole binary is followed over a factor of ~20 in separation after formation of a hard binary, considerably farther than in previous simulations. We see almost no dependence of the binary's decay rate on number of particles in the simulation, contrary to earlier studies in which a lower initial density of stars led to a more rapid depletion of the binary's loss cone. We nevertheless argue that the decay of a black hole binary in a real galaxy would be expected to stall at separations of 0.01-1 pc unless some additional mechanism is able to extract energy from the binary. Our results support a picture in which the observed dependence of nuclear cusp slope on galaxy luminosity is a consequence of galaxy interactions. We also discuss the implications of our results for the survivability of dark-matter cusps."

We present a systematic study on fine-tuning in minimal supersymmetric theories and identify low energy spectra that do not lead to severe fine-tuning. Characteristic features of these spectra are: a large A term for the top squarks, small top squark masses, moderately large tan\\beta, and a small \\mu parameter. There are classes of theories leading to these features, which are discussed. In one class, which allows a complete elimination of fine-tuning, the Higgsinos are the lightest among all the superpartners of the standard model particles, leading to three nearly degenerate neutralino/chargino states. This gives interesting signals at the LHC -- the dilepton invariant mass distribution has a very small endpoint and shows a particular shape determined by the Higgsino nature of the two lightest neutralinos. We demonstrate that these signals are indeed useful in realistic analyses by performing Monte Carlo simulations, including detector simulations and background estimations. We also present a method that allows the determination of all the relevant superparticle masses without using input from particular models, despite the limited kinematical information due to short cascades. This allows us to test various possible models, which is demonstrated in the case of a model with mixed moduli-anomaly mediation. We also give a simple derivation of special renormalization group properties associated with moduli mediated supersymmetry breaking, which are relevant in a model without fine-tuning."

        "Abstract": "Propagation of positive streamers, modeled by the electron avalanche mechanism, is simulated in a needle-plane gap. The streamer is modeled like an RC-circuit where the channel is a resistor and the extremities of the streamer have a capacitance towards the plane. The addition of the RC-model introduces in this work a time constant to the propagation model. Increase in capacitance as a streamer branch propagates reduces its potential, while conduction through the streamer channel increases its potential, as a function of the time constant of the RC-system. Streamer branching also increases the capacitance and decreases the potential of the branches. If the electric field within the streamer channel exceeds a threshold, a breakdown occurs in the channel, and the potential of the streamer is equalized with the needle electrode. This is interpreted as a re-illumination. According to this model, a low conductive streamer branch can propagate some distance before its potential is reduced to below the propagation threshold, and then the RC time constant controls the streamer propagation speed. Channel breakdowns, or re-illuminations, are less frequent when the channels are conductive and more frequent for more branched streamers."

The transition is characterized by the disappearance of the vortices from the annulus where the bulk of the superfluid is concentrated due to centrifugal forces while a macroscopic phase circulation remains. The analysis is carried out within two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii theory at large coupling constant and reveals significant differences between 'soft' anharmonic traps (like a quartic plus quadratic trapping potential) and traps with a fixed boundary: In the latter case the transition takes place in a parameter regime where the size of vortices is very small relative to the width of the annulus whereas in 'soft' traps the vortex lattice persists until the width of the annulus becomes comparable to the vortex cores. Moreover, the density profile in the annulus where the bulk is concentrated is, in the 'soft' case, approximately gaussian with long tails and not of the Thomas-Fermi type like in a trap with a fixed boundary."

Whenever $p$ differs from the golden ratio, asymptotically as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$, the winner of the game is determined. In the case where $p$ equals the golden ratio, we call such a random game a \\emph{golden game}.

Our main result provides a recursive formula for asymptotic fragility of golden games. Surprisingly, golden games are extremely fragile.

For low energy density $U$ a collapsed phase is identified, while in the high energy limit the particles are homogeneously distributed. A phase transition from the collapsed to the homogeneous state occurs at critical energy U_c. A theoretical analysis within the canonical ensemble identifies such a transition as first order. But microcanonical simulations reveal a negative specific heat regime near $U_c$. The dynamical behaviour of the system is affected by this transition : below U_c anomalous diffusion is observed, while for U > U_c the motion of the particles is almost ballistic. In the collapsed phase, finite $N$-effects act like a noise source of variance O(1/N), that restores normal diffusion on a time scale diverging with N. As a consequence, the asymptotic diffusion coefficient will also diverge algebraically with N and superdiffusion will be observable at any time in the limit N \\to \\infty. A Lyapunov analysis reveals that for U > U_c the maximal exponent \\lambda decreases proportionally to N^{-1/3} and vanishes in the mean-field limit.

The concern is not only related to an adversary taking physical or remote control of the device (e.g., via a malicious app), but also to what a passive adversary (without the above capabilities) can observe from the device communications. Work in this latter direction aimed, for example, at inferring the apps a user has installed on his device, or identifying the presence of a specific user within a network.   In this paper, we move a step forward: we investigate to which extent it is feasible to identify the specific actions that a user is doing on his mobile device, by simply eavesdropping the device's network traffic. In particular, we aim at identifying actions like browsing someone's profile on a social network, posting a message on a friend's wall, or sending an email. We design a system that achieves this goal starting from encrypted TCP/IP packets: it works through identification of network flows and application of machine learning techniques. We did a complete implementation of this system and run a thorough set of experiments, which show that it can achieve accuracy and precision higher than 95%, for most of the considered actions."

We prove that if C was hereditary, then the assignments V-> X_{V,ii} define algebra homomorphisms from the (dual) Hall-Ringel algebra of C to the P_{C,ii}, which generalize the well-known Feigin homomorphisms from the upper half of a quantum group to q-polynomial algebras.

Comput., 30 (2001), pp. 1863-1920]. We continue this line of research by considering domains containing more than two elements. We present two main results: a complete classification for the approximability of all maximal constraint languages over domains of cardinality at most 4, and a complete classification of the approximability of the problem when the set of allowed constraints contains all permutation constraints. Under the assumption that a conjecture due to Szczepara holds, we give a complete classification for all maximal constraint languages. These classes of languages are well-studied in universal algebra and computer science; they have, for instance, been considered in connection with machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Our results are proved by using algebraic results from clone theory and the results indicates that this approach is very powerful for classifying the approximability of certain optimisation problems."

        "Abstract": "A set is primitive if no element of the set divides another. We consider primitive sets of monic polynomials over a finite field and find natural generalizations of many of the results known for primitive sets of integers. In particular we generalize a result of Besicovitch to show that there exist primitive sets in $\\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ with upper density arbitrarily close to $\\frac{q - 1}{q}$. Then, for a primitive set $A$, we consider the sum $\\sum_{a \\in A} \\frac{1}{q^{\\deg a}\\deg a}$, the natural analogue in this setting of a sum considered by Erd\\H{o}s for primitive subsets of the integers, and show that it is uniformly bounded over all primitive sets $A$. We end with a generalization of work of Martin and Pomerance on the asymptotic growth rate of the counting function of a primitive set. Along the way we prove a quantitative analogue of the Hardy-Ramanujan theorem for function fields, as well as bounds on the size of the $k$-th irreducible polynomial."

        "Abstract": "High precision radial velocity observations of the solar-type star 16 Cygni B taken at McDonald Observatory and at Lick Observatory, have each independently discovered periodic radial-velocity variations indicating the presence of a Jovian-mass companion to this star. The orbital fit to the combined data gives a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude of 43.9 m/s, and an eccentricity of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 Msun, this implies a mass for the companion of 1.5 sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital eccentricity cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal manner with a low eccentricity orbit, and has undergone post-formational orbital evolution, either through the same process which formed the ``massive eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD114762, or by gravitational interactions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the object is an extremely low mass brown dwarf, formed through fragmentation of the collapsing protostar. We explore a possible connection between stellar photospheric Li depletion, pre-main sequence stellar rotation, the presence of a massive proto-planetary disk, and the formation of a planetary companion."

There have remained fundamental questions whether geometrical frustration preventing magnetic long-range order can induce quantum critical phenomena and how novel they are. Here, we employ a magnetic field angle as a tuning parameter and provide thermodynamic evidence for novel quantum criticality not only driven but also augmented by frustration in the quasi-kagome Kondo-lattice CeRhSn. The field-angle-resolved landscape of the entropy reveals the existence of a quantum critical line under a magnetic field, exactly parallel to the quasi-kagome plane. In particular, on this line, we observe a two-step decrease of the entropy accompanied by a qualitative change in the non-Fermi-liquid behavior. These results suggest that a partial release of frustration induces a quantum critical \"phase\", whose nature is distinctly different from the zero-field one."

One potential way to realize a dip is to require interactions to be zero when all particles are mass on-shell, but not if one or more are mass off-shell. For three particle interactions, we have found three interesting cases: one massive gauge boson with two identical scalars; one massless gauge boson with two different scalars; one massive gauge boson with two identical massless gauge bosons. For each case, we identify the relevant effective operators to explore its dip signature at the LHC. Unfortunately, the unstable particle with a vanishing mass-on-shell interaction has a complex mass which is coincident with the complex pole in its propagator. As a result, a contact-like amplitude without a dip is produced. We then point out two other interesting ways that generate a dip in the cross section. The first way has a dip signature due to a zero in the vertex form factor of the time-like momentum in the s-channel. In the second way, the dip plus bump signature appears because there is destructive interference among processes of exchanging different s-channel particles."

Here we show that the infimum amplification 3 is satisfied by a family of binary lenses where the source position is at the mid-point between the lens positions independently of the mass ratio which parameterizes the family. We present a new proof of an underlying constraint that the total amplification of the two positive images is bigger than that of the three negative images by one inside a caustic. We show that a similar constraint holds for an arbitrary class of $n$-point lens systems for the sources in the `maximal domains'. We introduce the notion that a source plane consists of {\\it graded caustic domains} and the `maximal domain' is the area of the source plane where a source star results in the maximum $n^2+1$ images. We show that the infimum amplification of a three point lens is 7, and it is bigger than $n^2+1-n$ for $n\\ge 4$.

Such searches can offer optimal sensitivity for a given computing cost and signal model, but are highly-tuned to specific signal types and are computationally expensive, even for semi-coherent searches. We have developed a search method based on the well-known Viterbi algorithm which is model-agnostic and has a computational cost several orders of magnitude lower than template methods, with a modest reduction in sensitivity. In particular, this method can search for signals which have an unknown frequency evolution. We test the algorithm on three simulated and real data sets: gapless Gaussian noise, Gaussian noise with gaps and real data from the final run of initial LIGO (S6). We show that at 95% efficiency, with a 1% false alarm rate, the algorithm has a depth sensitivity of $\\sim 33$, $10$ and $13$ ,Hz$^{-1/2}$ with corresponding SNRs of $\\sim 60$, $72$ and $74$ in these datasets. we discuss the use of this algorithm for detecting a wide range of quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave signals and instrumental lines."

The three balls have rebound coefficients of 0.9, 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. However, we notice that the Waboba bounces better than the others, but why? The Superball has a high coefficient of restitution, creating large rebounds. Here the impact is angled to the free surface, but the inelastic response and large mass ratio forces the ball underwater without skipping. The racquetball has a lower mass ratio and a more elastic response to impacts. Also thrown at a shallow angle, it bounces off of the surface of the water 1-3 times before coming to rest. The Waboba flattens inside the cavity allowing it to skip off of the surface more easily. The flattened ball looks more like a skipping stone than a sphere due to its large elastic deformation at impact. Examining the reaction of a skipping stone we see that the stone creates a cavity in which it planes, slipping out of it with some upward velocity. The Waboba behaves like a skipping stone planing on the surface of the water, allowing it to bounce upwards of 20 times and traveling nearly 60 meters. While some skill is needed to throw the Waboba across a pond, It adapts to each skip because of its elastic response, whereas the stone must be thrown perfectly in order to gain the best skipping advantage."

The algorithm is local, so is applicable to complicated networks if we are interested only in a part isomorphic to a tree. Moreover the numerical implementation requires only one matrix inversion or least squares minimization per discretization point in the physical network.

We show that for such 3d/5d double perovskites, strong correlations on the 5d-element (Re) are essential in driving a half-metallic ground state. Incorporating both strong spin-orbit coupling and the Hubbard repulsion on Re leads to a band structure consistent with ab initio calculations. Using our model, we find a large spin polarization at the Fermi level, and obtain a semi-quantitative understanding of the saturation magnetization of Ba2FeReO6, as well as X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data indicating a significant orbital magnetization. Based on the orbital populations obtained in our theory, we predict a specific doping dependence to the tetragonal distortion accompanying ferrimagnetic order. Finally, the combination of a net magnetization and spin-orbit interactions is shown to induce Weyl nodes in the band structure, and we predict a significant intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in hole-doped Ba2FeReO6. The uncovered interplay of strong correlations and spin-orbit coupling lends partial support to our previous work, which used a local moment description to capture the spin wave dispersion found in neutron scattering measurements. Our work is of broad interest for understanding metallic 4d-based and 5d-based double perovskites which are of fundamental interest and of possible relevance to spintronic applications."

The EZ model, which is a dynamical version of the herd formation model of Cont and Bouchaud (CB), gives a reasonable model for the formation of clusters of agents and for actions taken by clusters of agents. Both the EZ and CB models give a cluster size distribution characterized by a power law with an exponent -5/2. By introducing a size-dependent probability for dissociation of a cluster of agents, we show that the exponent characterizing the cluster size distribution becomes model-dependent and non-universal, with an exponential cutoff for large cluster sizes. The actions taken by the clusters of agents generate the price returns, the distribution of which is also characterized by a model-dependent exponent. When a size-dependent transaction rate is introduced instead of a size-dependent dissociation rate, it is found that the distribution of price returns is characterized by a model-dependent exponent while the exponent for the cluster-size distribution remains unchanged. The resulting systems provide simplified models of a financial market and yield power law behaviour with an easily tunable exponent."

Shortly, a paper by Anderson, Zou and us (BZA) undertook this task and initiated a program. Three key papers that followed, shortly, essentially completed the program, as far as superconductivity is concerned: i) a gauge theory approach by Anderson and us, that went beyond mean field theory ii) Kotliar's d-wave solution in BZA theory iii) improvement of a renormalized Hamiltonian in BZA theory, using a Gutzwiller approximation by Zhang, Gros, Rice and Shiba.

We show that, if a many-weight-dependent xc functional is employed, then it becomes possible to extract, in principle exactly, all individual energy levels from a single GOK-DFT calculation, exactly like in a SA-WF calculation. More precisely, starting from the Kohn-Sham energies, a global Levy-Zahariev-type shift as well as a state-specific (ensemble-based) xc derivative correction must be applied in order to reach the energy level of interest.

We present the analysis of the high-resolution (0.3-1 keV) RGS and low-resolution (0.3-10 keV) EPIC spectroscopic data. A comparison with a 1998 BeppoSAX observation suggests that XMM-Newton caught the source in a `reflection-dominated' phase, measuring the lowest continuum flux level ever (F(2-10 keV) = 2.3 x 10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1) in 2005. NGC 7582 therefore experienced a dramatic spectral transition most likely due to the partial switching-off of the nuclear activity. The XMM-Newton spectrum of the continuum emission is very complex. It can be well described by a model consisting of a combination of a heavily absorbed (Nh ~ 10^(24) cm^-2) power law and a pure reflection component both obscured by a column density of ~ 4 x 10^(22) cm^-2. Notably, we detect a significant increase by a factor of ~2 in the column density of the inner, thicker absorber covering the primary X-ray source between 2001 and 2005. The 2005 XMM-Newton spectra show the strongest Fe Kalpha emission line ever measured in this source. This is consistent with the line delayed time response to the decrease of the nuclear activity. Our analysis also reveals that the soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines from highly ionized metals. The detection of a narrow OVIII radiative recombination continuum suggests an origin in a photoionized plasma."

In the systems we studied, the bending energy of the chain is small compared to the Coulomb energy and the chains are always adsorbed on the colloid. We observe that the polarizability is large for short chains and small electrical fields and shows a non-monotonic behavior with the chain length at fixed charge density. The polarizability has a maximum for a chain length equal to half of the circumference of the colloid. For long chains we recover the polarizability of a classical conducting sphere. For short chains, the existence of a permanent dipole moment of the complexes leads to a van der Waal's-type long-range attraction between them. This attractive interaction vanishes for long chains (i.e., larger than the colloidal size), where the permanent dipole moment is negligible. For short distances the complexes interact with a deep short-ranged attraction which is due to energetic bridging for short chains and entropic bridging for long chains. Exceeding a critical chain length eventually leads to a pure repulsion. This shows that the stabilization of colloidal suspensions by polyelectrolyte adsorption is strongly dependent on the chain size relative to the colloidal size: for long chains the suspensions are always stable (only repulsive forces between the particles), while for mid-sized and short chains there is attraction between the complexes and a salting-out can occur."

More specifically, suppose $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix over $\\mathbb{C}$ (resp. $\\mathbb{R}$), and let $\\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of $n \\times n$ matrices over $\\mathbb{C}$ (resp. $\\mathbb{R}$) that can be written as a permutation matrix times a unitary diagonal matrix. Then it is known that the permanent of $A$ satisfies $|\\text{perm}(A)| \\leq \\Vert A \\Vert_{2} ^n$ with equality iff $A/ \\Vert A \\Vert_{2} \\in \\mathcal{P}$ (where $\\Vert A \\Vert_2$ is the operator $2$-norm of $A$). We show a stability version of this result asserting that unless $A$ is very close (in a particular sense) to one of these extremal matrices, its permanent is exponentially smaller (as a function of $n$) than $\\Vert A \\Vert_2 ^n$. In particular, for any fixed $\\alpha, \\beta > 0$, we show that $|\\text{perm}(A)|$ is exponentially smaller than $\\Vert A \\Vert_2 ^n$ unless all but at most $\\alpha n$ rows contain entries of modulus at least $\\Vert A \\Vert_2 (1 - \\beta)$."

        "Abstract": "Memory effects can be studied through a conditional past-future correlation, which measures departure with respect to a conditional past-future independence valid in a memoryless Markovian regime. In a quantum regime this property leads to an operational definition of quantum non-Markovianity based on three consecutive system measurement processes and postselection [Budini, Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 240401 (2018)]. Here, we study the conditional past-future correlation for a qubit system coupled to different dephasing environments. Exact solutions are obtained for a quantum spin bath as well as for classically fluctuating random Hamiltonian models. The developing of memory effects and departures from Born-Markov or white-noise approximations are related to a measurement back action that changes the system dynamics between consecutive measurements. It is shown that this effect may develop even when the former system evolution is given by a time-independent Lindblad equation. This unusual non-Markovian case arises when the characteristic parameters of the dynamics become Lorentzian random distributed variables."

Timing observations were mainly conducted with the Nancay radiotelescope (France) and confirmation comes from the 140ft radiotelescope at Green Bank and the new Green Bank Telescope data. This event is characterized by a rotation frequency step of 3 nHz, or 10^-11 in fractional frequency change along with a short duration limited to a few days or a week. A marginally significant frequency derivative step was also found. This glitch follows the main characteristics of those in the slow period pulsars, but is two orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest ever recorded. Such an event must be very rare for millisecond pulsars since no other glitches have been detected when the cumulated number of years of millisecond pulsar timing observations up to 2001 is around 500 for all these objects. However, pulsar PSR B1821-24 is one of the youngest among the old recycled ones and there is likely a correlation between age, or a related parameter, and timing noise. While this event happens on a much smaller scale, the required adjustment of the star to a new equilibrium figure as it spins down is a likely common cause for all glitches."

        "Abstract": "Atom-in-jellium calculations of the Einstein frequency were used to calculate the mean displacement of an ion over a wide range of compression and temperature. Expressed as a fraction of the Wigner-Seitz radius, the displacement is a measure of the asymptotic freedom of the ion at high temperature, and thus of the change in heat capacity from 6 to 3 quadratic degrees of freedom per atom. A functional form for free energy was proposed based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as a correction to the Debye free energy, with a single free parameter representing the effective density of potential modes to be saturated. This parameter was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations, and found to be ~0.2 per atom. In this way, the ion-thermal contribution can be calculated for a wide-range equation of state (EOS) without requiring a large number of molecular dynamics simulations. Example calculations were performed for carbon, including the sensitivity of key EOS loci to ionic freedom."

The method uses a spectral representation for the total electrostatic energy of the composite. The force is expressed as a certain gradient of this energy, which can be expressed in a closed analytic form rather than evaluated as a numerical derivative. The method is applicable even when both the spheres and the host have frequency-dependent dielectric functions and nonzero conductivities, provided the system is in the quasistatic regime. In principle, it includes all multipolar contributions to the force, and it can be used to calculate multi-body as well as pairwise forces. We also present several numerical examples, including host fluids with finite conductivities. The force between spheres approaches the dipole-dipole limit, as expected, at large separations, but departs drastically from that limit when the spheres are nearly in contact. The force may also change sign as a function of frequency when the host is a slightly conducting fluid."

The deep observation of 197.4 h has been performed with the HEGRA stereoscopic system of 5 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT system). 1ES1959+650 is located at a redshift of z = 0.047, providing an intermediate distance between the nearby Blazars Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, and the much more distant object H1426+428.

The Feynman diagrams are defined from a fermionic gas with a two-body interaction. The generalized recurrence is valid for connected Feynman diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and an arbitrary order. The recurrence formula terms are expressed in function of weak compositions of non-negative integers and partitions of positive integers in such a way that to each term of the recurrence correspond a partition and a weak composition. The foundation of this enumeration is the Wick theorem, permitting an easy generalization to any quantum field theory. The iterative enumeration is constructive and enables a fast computation of the number of connected Feynman diagrams for a large amount of cases. In particular, the recurrence is solved exactly for two and four external legs, leading to the asymptotic expansion of the number of different connected Feynman diagrams."

Here, we demonstrate that the decay and revival of the Loschmidt echo follows power-law scaling in the system size and the distance from a critical point with equilibrium critical exponents. We reveal such dynamical scaling laws by analyzing relevant perturbations to the Loschmidt echo cast in a scaling invariant form. We confirm the validity and the generality of the predicted dynamical scaling laws with a diverse range of critical models such as Ising spin models with a short and long range interaction, a finite-component system phase transition, and a topological phase transition. Moreover, using the integrability of systems in the thermodynamic limit, we derive such scaling laws analytically from a microscopic analysis. Our finding promotes the Loschmidt echo to a quantitative non-equilibrium probe of criticality and allows for quantitative predictions on the role of criticality on various physical scenarios where the Loschmidt echo is central to describing non-equilibrium dynamics."

The empirical description adopted for the direct continuum is the commonly used power law with an exponential cut-off. The most direct test of the theoretical predictions, namely that the equivalent width of the line, Walpha, and the strength R of the reflection relative to the direct continuum are closely related to each other, gives a substantially positive result, that is their mean ratio is very close to expectation, and only a modest spread in the iron abundance seems implied. The existence of a steep correlation between R and the slope Gamma of the power law is not confirmed. A weak evidence is found that the existence of a very shallow trend to increase on average with Gamma cannot be altogether excluded in both R and Walpha, but needs to be tested with a larger sample. The energy Ef in the exponential cut-off spans a range from about 80 to more than 300 keV. A possible correlation is found, with Ef increasing on average with Gamma: if ignored, for instance by keeping Ef at a fixed value in a sample study, it could be cause of artificial steepening in a correlation between R and Gamma."

        "Abstract": "Single-step implementations of multi-qubit gates are generally believed to provide a simpler design, a faster operation, and a lower decoherence. For coupled three qubits interacting with a photon field, a realizable scheme for a single-step Toffoli gate is investigated. We find that the three qubit system can be described by four effective modified Jaynes-Cummings models in the states of two control qubits. Within the rotating wave approximation, the modified Jaynes-Cummings models are shown to be reduced to the conventional Jaynes-Cummings models with renormalized couplings between qubits and photon fields. A single-step Toffoli gate is shown to be realizable with tuning the four characteristic oscillation periods that satisfy a commensurate condition. Possible values of system parameters are estimated for single-step Toffli gate. From numerical calculation, further, our single-step Toffoli gate operation errors are discussed due to imperfections in system parameters, which shows that a Toffoli gate with high fidelity can be obtained by adjusting pairs of the photon-qubit and the qubit-qubit coupling strengthes. In addition, a decoherence effect on the Toffoli gate operation is discussed due to a thermal reservoir."

        "Title": "A Turbo Coding System for High Speed Communications",
        "Abstract": "Conventional turbo codes (CTCs) usually employ a block-oriented interleaving so that each block is separately encoded and decoded. As interleaving and de-interleaving are performed within a block, the message-passing process associated with an iterative decoder is limited to proceed within the corresponding range. This paper presents a new turbo coding scheme that uses a special interleaver structure and a multiple-round early termination test involving both sign check and a CRC code. The new interleaver structure is naturally suited for high speed parallel processing and the resulting coding system offers new design options and tradeoffs that are not available to CTCs. In particular, it becomes possible for the decoder to employ an efficient inter-block collaborative decoding algorithm, passing the information obtained from termination test proved blocks to other unproved blocks. It also becomes important to have a proper decoding schedule. The combined effect is improved performance and reduction in the average decoding delay (whence the required computing power). A memory (storage) management mechanism is included as a critical part of the decoder so as to provide additional design tradeoff between performance and memory size. It is shown that the latter has a modular-like effect in that additional memory units render enhanced performance due not only to less forced early terminations but to possible increases of the interleaving depth. Depending on the decoding schedule, the degree of parallelism and other decoding resources available, the proposed scheme admits a variety of decoder architectures that meet a large range of throughput and performance demands."

        "Abstract": "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of green and sustainable projects has been found to be a necessary analysis in order to include all upstream, downstream, and indirect impacts. Because of the complexity of interactions, the differential impacts with respect to a baseline, i.e., a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, are commonly considered to relatively compare various projects. However, as the degree of penetration of a project in the baseline increases, the popular marginal assumption does no longer hold, and the differential impacts may become inconsistent. Although various mythologies have been successfully proposed and used to contain such a side effect, the bottom-up nature, which initiates the assessment from the project itself and ultimately widens the scope, could easily fail to acknowledge critical modifications to the baseline. This is highly relevant in terms of ICT's disruptive and dynamic technologies which push the baseline to become a marginal legacy. In this work, an analytic formalism is presented to provide a means of comparison of such technologies and projects. The core idea behind the proposed methodology is a magnitude-insensitive graph-based distance function to differentially compare a project with a baseline. The applicability of the proposed methodology is then evaluated in a use case of OTT/IPTV online media distribution services."

When a small number of convexes are used, such a decomposition can be thought of as a piece-wise approximation of the geometry. This decomposition is fundamental to real-time physics simulation in computer graphics, where it creates a unifying representation of dynamic geometry for collision detection. A convex object also has the property of being simultaneously an explicit and implicit representation: one can interpret it explicitly as a mesh derived by computing the vertices of a convex hull, or implicitly as the collection of half-space constraints or support functions. Their implicit representation makes them particularly well suited for neural network training, as they abstract away from the topology of the geometry they need to represent. We introduce a network architecture to represent a low dimensional family of convexes. This family is automatically derived via an autoencoding process. We investigate the applications of the network including automatic convex decomposition, image to 3D reconstruction, and part-based shape retrieval."

Efficient resource utilization is an important design aspect in such processors. Depending on the workload, mis-speculated execution can severely impact resource utilization and power utilization. In general, compared to a uniprocessor, a multithreaded processor may have better tolerance towards mis-speculation. However there can still be phases where even a multi-threaded processor performance may get impacted by branch induced mis-speculation. In this paper I propose monitoring the branch predictor behavior of various hardware threads running on the multi-threaded processor and use that information as a feedback to the thread arbiter/picker which schedules the next thread to fetch instructions from. If I find that a particular thread is going through a phase where it is consistently mis-predicting its branches and its average branch misprediction stall is above a specific threshold then I temporarily reduce the priority for picking that thread. I do a qualitative comparison of various solutions to the problem of resource inefficiency caused due to mis-speculated branches in multithreaded processors.

For in many scenarios it is not feasible to use money to compensate agents for otherwise unsatisfactory outcomes. This paper studies this question, looking at both fairness and efficiency measures.   We employ the proportionally fair solution, which is a well-known fairness concept for money-free settings. But although finding a proportionally fair solution is computationally tractable, it cannot be implemented in a truthful fashion. Consequently, we seek approximate solutions. We give several truthful mechanisms which achieve proportional fairness in an approximate sense. We use a strong notion of approximation, requiring the mechanism to give each agent a good approximation of its proportionally fair utility. In particular, one of our mechanisms provides a better and better approximation factor as the minimum demand for every good increases. A motivating example is provided by the massive privatization auction in the Czech republic in the early 90s.   With regard to efficiency, prior work has shown a lower bound of 0.5 on the approximation factor of any swap-dictatorial mechanism approximating a social welfare measure even for the two agents and multiple goods case. We surpass this lower bound by designing a non-swap-dictatorial mechanism for this case. Interestingly, the new mechanism builds on the notion of proportional fairness."

Such an effect, if real, would destabilize a neutron star. To address this issue we have studied the related problem of a massless neutrino field in the presence of an external, static electroweak potential of finite range. To be precise, we have computed to one loop the exact vacuum energy for the case of a spherical square well potential of depth alpha and radius R. For small wells, the vacuum energy is reliably determined by a perturbative expansion in the external potential. For large wells, however, the perturbative expansion breaks down. A manifestation of this breakdown is that the vacuum carries a non-zero neutrino charge. The energy and neutrino charge of the ground state are, to a good approximation for large wells, those of a neutrino condensate with chemical potential mu=alpha. Our results demonstrate explicitly that long-range forces due to the exchange of massless neutrinos do not threaten the stability of neutron stars."

Control actions are then selected from a dense control set according to an objective function that rewards improvements in matching the dataset while also encouraging sparsity. This method is evaluated across several experiments involving real and synthetic datasets, and it is shown to generate smaller control sets when compared to the previous state-of-the-art lattice control set computation technique, with these smaller control sets maintaining a high degree of manoeuvrability in the required task. This results in a planning time speedup of up to 4.31x when using the learned control set over the state-of-the-art computed control set.

        "Abstract": "We investigate a generalized Lagrange multiplier system in a Banach space, called a mixed variational-hemivariational inequality (MVHVI, for short), which contains a hemivariational inequality and a variational inequality. First, we employ the Minty technique and a monotonicity argument to establish an equivalence theorem, which provides three different equivalent formulations of the inequality problem. Without compactness for one of operators in the problem, a general existence theorem for (MVHVI) is proved by using the Fan-Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz principle combined with methods of nonsmooth analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate several crucial properties of the solution set to (MVHVI) which include boundedness, convexity, weak closedness, and continuity. Finally, a uniqueness result with respect to the first component of the solution for the inequality problem is proved by using the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition. All results are obtained in a general functional framework in reflexive Banach spaces."

        "Title": "Convolutional Dictionary Learning in Hierarchical Networks",
        "Abstract": "Filter banks are a popular tool for the analysis of piecewise smooth signals such as natural images. Motivated by the empirically observed properties of scale and detail coefficients of images in the wavelet domain, we propose a hierarchical deep generative model of piecewise smooth signals that is a recursion across scales: the low pass scale coefficients at one layer are obtained by filtering the scale coefficients at the next layer, and adding a high pass detail innovation obtained by filtering a sparse vector. This recursion describes a linear dynamic system that is a non-Gaussian Markov process across scales and is closely related to multilayer-convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) generative model for deep networks, except that our model allows for deeper architectures, and combines sparse and non-sparse signal representations. We propose an alternating minimization algorithm for learning the filters in this hierarchical model given observations at layer zero, e.g., natural images. The algorithm alternates between a coefficient-estimation step and a filter update step. The coefficient update step performs sparse (detail) and smooth (scale) coding and, when unfolded, leads to a deep neural network. We use MNIST to demonstrate the representation capabilities of the model, and its derived features (coefficients) for classification."

        "Abstract": "We develop a learning framework for building deformable templates, which play a fundamental role in many image analysis and computational anatomy tasks. Conventional methods for template creation and image alignment to the template have undergone decades of rich technical development. In these frameworks, templates are constructed using an iterative process of template estimation and alignment, which is often computationally very expensive. Due in part to this shortcoming, most methods compute a single template for the entire population of images, or a few templates for specific sub-groups of the data. In this work, we present a probabilistic model and efficient learning strategy that yields either universal or conditional templates, jointly with a neural network that provides efficient alignment of the images to these templates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on a variety of domains, with a special focus on neuroimaging. This is particularly useful for clinical applications where a pre-existing template does not exist, or creating a new one with traditional methods can be prohibitively expensive.

There is a unique infinite matrix $(c_{ij})$ with $0,1$ entries satisfying $$ U_iU_j=(-1)^{c_{ij}}U_jU_i, \\qquad i,j=1,2,.... $$ Every matrix $(c_{ij})$ with $0,1$ entries satisfying $c_{ij}=c_{ji}$ and $c_{ii}=0$ arises from a nontrivial irreducible spin system, and there are uncountably many such matrices.   Infinite dimensional irreducible representations exist when the commutation matrix $(c_{ij})$ is of \"infinite rank\". In such cases we show that the $C^*$-algebra generated by an irreducible spin system is the CAR algebra, an infinite tensor product of copies of $M_2(\\Bbb C)$, and we classify the irreducible spin systems associated with a given matrix $(c_{ij})$ up to approximate unitary equivalence. That follows from a structural result. The $C^*$-algebra generated by the universal spin system $u_1,u_2,...$ of $(c_{ij})$ decomposes into a tensor product $C(X)\\otimes\\Cal A$, where $X$ is a Cantor set (possibly finite) and $\\Cal A$ is either the CAR algebra or a finite tensor product of copies of $M_2(\\Bbb C)$.

        "Abstract": "By using a one-zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model of a disk galaxy undergoing a dusty starburst, we investigate, numerically, the optical spectroscopic properties in order to explore galaxy evolution in distant clusters. We adopt an assumption that the degree of dust extinction (represented by $A_V$) depends on the ages of starburst populations in such a way that younger stars have larger $A_V$ (originally referred to as selective dust extinction by Poggianti & Wu 2000). In particular, we investigate how the time evolution of the equivalent widths of [OII]$\\lambda$3727 and H$\\delta$ is controlled by the adopted age dependence. This leads to three main results: (1) If a young stellar population (with the age of $\\sim$ $10^6$ yr) is more heavily obscured by dust than an old one ($>$ $10^8$ yr), the galaxy can show an ``e(a)'' spectrum characterized by strong H$\\delta$ absorption and relatively modest [OII] emission. (2) A dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a) spectrum can evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k (or k+a) spectrum 0.2 Gyr after the starburst and then into a passive one with a k-type spectrum 1 Gyr after the starburst. This result clearly demonstrates an evolutionary link between galaxies with different spectral classes (i.e., e(b), e(a), a+k, k+a, and k). (3) A dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum even in the dusty starburst phase if the age-dependence of dust extinction is rather weak, i.e., if young starburst populations with different ages ($\\le$ $10^7$ yr) are uniformly obscured by dust."

In contrast, often in statistical practice a model offers a good description of the data even though it is not the \"true\" random generator. We consider a more flexible approach based on contamination neighbourhoods around a model. Using trimming methods and the Kolmogorov metric we introduce a functional statistic measuring departures from a contaminated model and the associated estimator corresponding to its sample version. We show how this estimator allows testing of fit for the (slightly) contaminated model vs sensible deviations from it, with uniformly exponentially small type I and type II error probabilities. We also address the asymptotic behavior of the estimator showing that, under suitable regularity conditions, it asymptotically behaves as the supremum of a Gaussian process. As an application we explore methods of comparison between descriptive models based on the paradigm of model falseness. We also include some connections of our approach with the False-Discovery-Rate setting, showing competitive behavior when estimating the contamination level, although applicable in a wider framework."

        "Abstract": "Competitions can occur on an absolute scale, to be faster or more efficient, or they can occur on a relative scale, to \"beat\" one's competitor in a zero-sum game. Ecological models have focused on absolute competitions, in which optima exist. Classic evolutionary models such as the Wright-Fisher model, as well as more recent models of travelling waves, have focused on purely relative competitions, in which fitness continues to increase indefinitely, without actually progressing anywhere. This manuscript proposes a new way to describe both at the same time. It begins with a revised version of r/K-selection theory. r continues to describe maximum reproductive speed, but the new version of K, with a different subscript, now describes parsimoniousness in territory use, a group-selected, anti-tragedy-of-the-commons trait. A third dimension c of fitness is then added to this novel system, one which is unitless and normalized, and hence capable of capturing the population genetics concept w of a strictly relative, genetically-limited competitive race. MacArthur's original version of r/K-selection theory is shown to confound parsimoniousness K with competitive ability c, despite the fact that available data suggests a negative correlation between the two; here they are disentangled. A rotation of the resulting three-dimensional system provides a population genetic underpinning for Grime's universal adaptive strategy theory of ruderals (selected for high r), stress tolerators (selected for a combination of high r and high K), and competitors (selected for a combination of high r and high c)."

In modeling these broad-band data, we find that an isotropic explosion in a constant density medium is unable to simultaneously fit both the radio and optical data. However, a jet-like outflow with an opening angle of 10-20 degress provides a good description of the data. The evidence in favor of a jet interpretation is based on the behavior of the radio light curves, since the expected jet break is masked at optical wavelengths by the light of the host galaxy. We also find evidence for extinction, presumably arising from within the host galaxy, with A(V)=0.4 mag, and host flux densities of F_R=1.1 uJy and F_K=1.7 uJy. These values supercede previous work on this burst due to the availability of a broad-band data set allowing a global fitting approach. A model in which the GRB explodes into a wind-stratified circumburst medium cannot be ruled out by these data. However, in examining a sample of other bursts (e.g. GRB990510, GRB000301C) we favor the jet interpretation for GRB000418."

We give a new definition of a vertex algebra which includes chiral algebras as a special case, but allows for fields which are neither meromorphic nor anti-meromorphic. To any complex torus equipped with a flat Kahler metric and a closed 2-form we associate an N=2 superconformal vertex algebra (N=2 SCVA) in the sense of our definition. We find a criterion for two different tori to produce isomorphic N=2 SCVA's. We show that for algebraic tori isomorphism of N=2 SCVA's implies the equivalence of the derived categories of coherent sheaves corresponding to the tori or their noncommutative generalizations (Azumaya algebras over tori). We also find a criterion for two different tori to produce N=2 SCVA's related by a mirror morphism. If the 2-form is of type (1,1), this condition is identical to the one proposed by Golyshev, Lunts, and Orlov, who used an entirely different approach inspired by the Homological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture of Kontsevich. Our results suggest that Kontsevich's conjecture must be modified: coherent sheaves must be replaced with modules over Azumaya algebras, and the Fukaya category must be ``twisted'' by a closed 2-form. We also describe the implications of our results for BPS D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds."

Starting from a well-defined model Hamiltonian, which includes the effects of driving current and dissipative coupling to a heat bath, we write down the Heisenberg equations of motion for the variables of the Josephson junction and the cavity mode. In the limit of many photons, these equations reduce to coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically. We present a review of some characteristic numerical results, which show many features similar to experiment. These include self-induced resonant steps (SIRS's) at voltages $V = n\\hbar\\Omega/(2e)$, where $\\Omega$ is the cavity frequency, and $n$ is generally an integer; a threshold number $N_c$ of active rows of junctions above which the array is coherent; and a time-averaged cavity energy which is quadratic in the number of active junctions, when the array is above threshold. When the array is biased on a SIRS, then, for given junction parameters, the power radiated into the array varies as the square of the number of active junctions, consistent with expectations for coherent radiation. For a given step, a two-dimensional array radiates much more energy into the cavity than does a one-dimensional array. Finally, in two dimensions, we find a strong polarization effect: if the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to the direction of current injection in a square array, then it does not couple to the array and no power is radiated into the cavity."

In this market, there are multiple buyers (advertisers), and items (slots) that are arranged in a line such as a banner on a website. Each buyer desires a particular number of {\\em consecutive} slots and has a per-unit-quality value $v_i$ (dependent on the ad only) while each slot $j$ has a quality $q_j$ (dependent on the position only such as click-through rate in position auctions). Hence, the valuation of the buyer $i$ for item $j$ is $v_iq_j$. We want to decide the allocations and the prices in order to maximize the total revenue of the market maker.   A key difference from the traditional position auction is the advertiser's requirement of a fixed number of consecutive slots. Consecutive slots may be needed for a large size rich media ad. We study three major pricing mechanisms, the Bayesian pricing model, the maximum revenue market equilibrium model and an envy-free solution model. Under the Bayesian model, we design a polynomial time computable truthful mechanism which is optimum in revenue. For the market equilibrium paradigm, we find a polynomial time algorithm to obtain the maximum revenue market equilibrium solution. In envy-free settings, an optimal solution is presented when the buyers have the same demand for the number of consecutive slots. We conduct a simulation that compares the revenues from the above schemes and gives convincing results."

We present a discussion of the characterization of risks and of the optimization of portfolios that starts from a simple illustrative model and ends by a general functional integral formulation. A major theme is that risk, usually thought one-dimensional in the conventional mean-variance approach, has to be addressed by the full distribution of losses. Furthermore, the time-horizon of the investment is shown to play a major role. We show the importance of accounting for large fluctuations and use the theory of Cram\\'er for large deviations in this context. We first treat a simple model with a single risky asset that examplifies the distinction between the average return and the typical return, the role of large deviations in multiplicative processes, and the different optimal strategies for the investors depending on their size. We then analyze the case of assets whose price variations are distributed according to exponential laws, a situation that is found to describe reasonably well daily price variations. Several portfolio optimization strategies are presented that aim at controlling large risks. We end by extending the standard mean-variance portfolio optimization theory, first within the quasi-Gaussian approximation and then using a general formulation for non-Gaussian correlated assets in terms of the formalism of functional integrals developed in the field theory of critical phenomena."

On a square symmetry lattice made of three (economic) regions, firms, described by a scalar fitness, are allowed to move, adapt, merge or create spin-offs under predetermined rules, in a space and time dependent economic environment. We only consider here one timely variation of the ''external economic field condition''. For the firm fitness evolution we take into account a constraint such that the disappearance of a firm modifies the fitness of nearest neighboring ones, as in Bak-Sneppen population fitness evolution model. The concentration of firms, the averaged fitness, the regional distribution of firms, and fitness for different time moments, the number of collapsed, merged and new firms as a function of time have been recorded and are discussed. Also the asymptotic values of the number of firms present in the three regions together with their average fitness, as well as the number of respective births and collapses in the three regions are examined. It appears that a sort of $critical$ selection pressure exists. A power law dependence, signature of self-critical organization is seen in the birth and collapse asymptotic values for a high selection pressure only. A lack of self-organization is also seen at region borders."

        "Abstract": "Situations where a group of agents come together to jointly buy a resource that they individually cannot afford to buy are commonly observed in markets. For example in the US market for radio spectrum, a recent proposal invited small firms who would benefit from gaining additional access to spectrum to jointly submit bids for blocks of spectrum with the idea that its utilization could be shared. In such a scenario, the problem is to design a mechanism that truthfully elicits and aggregates the privately held preferences of these agents, and enables them to act as a single decision-making body in order to participate in the market. In this paper, we design a class of mechanisms called monotonic aggregation mechanisms that achieves this under a specific setting. We assume that the resource is being sold in a sealed-bid second-price auction that solicits bids for the entire resource. Our mechanism truthfully elicits utility functions from the buyers, prescribes a joint bid, and prescribes a division of the payment and the resource in the event that they win the resource in the auction. This mechanism further satisfies a popular notion of collusion-resistance known as coalition-strategyproofness. We give two explicit examples of this generic class for the case where the utility functions of the buyers are non-decreasing and concave."

We show that this parameter space can be represented by fewer variables, namely the \\emph{orbit invariants} obtained by exploiting texture symmetry. Next we show how a class of locally countable texture statistics, the Minkowski functionals -- recently shown to be a proxy for human performance in texture discrimination tasks - can be written as a linear combination of the dihedral orbit invariants. Furthermore, by recasting these functionals as a combination of dihedral invariants, a generalization of these functionals can be obtained for textures of any number of grey-levels, patch sizes, or lattice types -- greatly reducing the number of dimensions/parameters needed to characterize the generated images. Orbit invariants may therefore provide a clue on the discrimination of these richer textures, as the ordinary Minkowski functionals do for binary textures."

For low energy density $U$ a collapsed phase is identified, while in the high energy limit the particles are homogeneously distributed. A phase transition from the collapsed to the homogeneous state occurs at critical energy U_c. A theoretical analysis within the canonical ensemble identifies such a transition as first order. But microcanonical simulations reveal a negative specific heat regime near $U_c$. The dynamical behaviour of the system is affected by this transition : below U_c anomalous diffusion is observed, while for U > U_c the motion of the particles is almost ballistic. In the collapsed phase, finite $N$-effects act like a noise source of variance O(1/N), that restores normal diffusion on a time scale diverging with N. As a consequence, the asymptotic diffusion coefficient will also diverge algebraically with N and superdiffusion will be observable at any time in the limit N \\to \\infty. A Lyapunov analysis reveals that for U > U_c the maximal exponent \\lambda decreases proportionally to N^{-1/3} and vanishes in the mean-field limit.

Furthermore, the operators $a(\\Delta)$ can be realized as multiplication operators in the $L^2$-space with respect to this point process.

The broad C IV lines, however, are probably not a good indicator of systemic redshift; and LBQS 0103-2753 A and B could have a much smaller systemic redshift difference, like the other known binary quasars.

There is now one known 0.3 arcsec binary among roughly 500 QSOs that have been observed in a way that would reveal such a close binary. This suggests that QSO activity is substantially more likely for black hole binaries at spacings ~2 kpc than at ~15 to 60 kpc. Between 1987 and 1998, the observed Mg II BAL disappeared."

        "Title": "Anomalous electronic shot noise in resonant tunneling junctions",
        "Abstract": "We study the behavior of shot noise in resonant tunneling junctions far from equilibrium. Quantum-coherent elastic charge transport can be characterized by a transmission function, that is the probability for an incoming electron at a given energy to tunnel through a potential barrier. In systems such as quantum point contacts, electronic shot noise is oftentimes calculated based on a constant (energy independent) transmission probability, a good approximation at low temperatures and under a small bias voltage. Here, we generalize these investigations to far from equilibrium settings by evaluating the contributions of electronic resonances to the electronic current noise. Our study extends canonical expressions for the voltage-activated shot noise and the recently discovered delta-T noise to the far from equilibrium regime, when a high bias voltage or a temperature difference is applied. In particular, when the Fermi energy is located on the shoulder of a broad resonance, we arrive at a formula for the shot noise revealing anomalous-nonlinear behavior at high bias voltage."

        "Title": "Collisionless dynamics of the condensate predicted in the random phase  approximation",
        "Abstract": "From the microscopic theory, we derive a number conserving quantum kinetic equation, valid for a dilute Bose gas at any temperature, in which the binary collisions between the quasi-particles are mediated by phonon-like excitations (called ``condenson''). This different approach starts from the many-body Hamiltonian of a Boson gas and uses, in an appropriate way, the generalized random phase approximation. As a result, the collision term of the kinetic equation contains higher order contributions in the expansion in the interaction parameter. This different expansion shows up that a scattering involves the emission and the absorption of a phonon-like excitation. The major interest of this particular mechanism is that, in a regime where the condensate is stable, the collision process between condensed and non condensed particles is totally blocked due to a total annihilation of the mutual interaction potential induced by the condensate itself. As a consequence, the condensate is not constrained to relax and can be superfluid. Furthermore, a Boltzmann-like H-theorem for the entropy exists for this equation and allows to distinguish between dissipative and non dissipative phenomena (like vortices). We also illustrate the analogy between this approach and the kinetic theory for a plasma, in which the excitations correspond precisely to a plasmon. Finally, we show the equivalence of this theory with the non-number conserving Bogoliubov theory at zero temperature."

        "Abstract": "Accurate classification of self-care problems in children who suffer from physical and motor affliction is an important problem in the healthcare industry. This is a difficult and a time consumming process and it needs the expertise of occupational therapists. In recent years, healthcare professionals have opened up to the idea of using expert systems and artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and classification of self care problems. In this study, we propose a new deep learning based approach named Care2Vec for solving these kind of problems and use a real world self care activities dataset that is based on a conceptual framework designed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Care2Vec is a mix of unsupervised and supervised learning where we use Autoencoders and Deep neural networks as a two step modeling process. We found that Care2Vec has a better prediction accuracy than some of the traditional methods reported in the literature for solving the self care classification problem viz. Decision trees and Artificial neural networks."

        "Abstract": "We include the effect of evaporation in our evolutionary calculations of close-in giant planets, based on a recent model for thermal evaporation taking into account the XUV flux of the parent star (Lammer et al. 2003). Our analysis leads to the existence of a critical mass for a given orbital distance $m_{\\rm crit}(a)$ below which the evaporation timescale becomes shorter than the thermal timescale of the planet. For planets with initial masses below $m_{\\rm crit}$, evaporation leads to a rapid expansion of the outer layers and of the total planetary radius, speeding up the evaporation process. Consequently, the planet does not survive as long as estimated by a simple application of mass loss rates without following consistently its evolution. We find out that the transit planet HD 209458b might be in such a dramatic phase, although with an extremely small probability. As a consequence, we predict that, after a certain time, only planets above a value $m_{\\rm crit}(a)$ should be present at an orbital distance $a$ of a star. For planets with initial masses above $m_{\\rm crit}$, evaporation does not affect the evolution of the radius with time."

        "Abstract": "We present a method to investigate the radial stability of a spherical anisotropic system that hosts a central supermassive black hole (SBH). Such systems have never been tested before for stability, although high anisotropies have been considered in the dynamical models that were used to estimate the masses of the central putative supermassive black holes. A family of analytical anisotropic spherical Hernquist models with and without a black hole were investigated by means of N-body simulations. A clear trend emerges that the supermassive black hole has a significant effect on the overall stability of the system, i.e. an SBH with a mass of a few percent of the total mass of the galaxy can prevent or reduce the bar instabilities in anisotropic systems. Its mass not only determines the strength of the instability reduction, but also the time in which this occurs. These effects are most significant for models with strong radial anisotropies. Furthermore, our analysis shows that unstable systems with similar SBH but with different anisotropy radii evolve differently: highly radial systems become oblate, while more isotropic models tend to form into prolate structures. In addition to this study, we also present a Monte-Carlo algorithm to generate particles in spherical anisotropic systems."

        "Abstract": "Electro-vacuum black holes are scale-invariant; their energy-momentum tensor is traceless. Quantum corrections of various sorts, however, can often produce a trace anomaly and a breakdown of scale-invariance. The (quantum-corrected) black hole solutions of the corresponding gravitational effective field theory (EFT) have a non-vanishing Ricci scalar. Then, the presence of a scalar field with the standard non-minimal coupling $\\xi \\phi^2 R$ naturally triggers a spontaneous scalarisation of the corresponding black holes. This scalarisation phenomenon occurs for an (infinite) discrete set of $\\xi$. We illustrate the occurrence of this phenomenon for two examples of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole solution of EFTs. In one example the trace anomaly comes from the matter sector -- a novel, closed form, generalisation of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution with an $F^4$ correction -- whereas in the other example it comes from the geometry sector -- a noncommutative geometry generalization of the Schwarzschild black hole. For comparison, we also consider the scalarisation of a black hole surrounded by (non-conformally invariant) classical matter (Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes). We find that the scalarised solutions are, generically, entropically favoured."

It is shown that if the initial data for an expanding cosmological model of this type is subjected to a small perturbation then the corresponding solution exists globally in the future and the perturbation decays in a way which can be described precisely. It is emphasized that no linearization of the equations or special symmetry assumptions are needed. The result can also be interpreted as a proof of the nonlinear stability of the homogeneous models. In order to prove the theorem we write the general solution as the sum of a homogeneous background and a perturbation. As a by-product of the analysis it is found that there is an invariant sense in which an inhomogeneous model can be regarded as a perturbation of a unique homogeneous model. A method is given for associating uniquely to each Newtonian cosmological model with compact spatial sections a spatially homogeneous model which incorporates its large-scale dynamics. This procedure appears very natural in the Newton-Cartan theory which we take as the starting point for Newtonian cosmology."

On a square symmetry lattice made of three (economic) regions, firms, described by a scalar fitness, are allowed to move, adapt, merge or create spin-offs under predetermined rules, in a space and time dependent economic environment. We only consider here one timely variation of the ''external economic field condition''. For the firm fitness evolution we take into account a constraint such that the disappearance of a firm modifies the fitness of nearest neighboring ones, as in Bak-Sneppen population fitness evolution model. The concentration of firms, the averaged fitness, the regional distribution of firms, and fitness for different time moments, the number of collapsed, merged and new firms as a function of time have been recorded and are discussed. Also the asymptotic values of the number of firms present in the three regions together with their average fitness, as well as the number of respective births and collapses in the three regions are examined. It appears that a sort of $critical$ selection pressure exists. A power law dependence, signature of self-critical organization is seen in the birth and collapse asymptotic values for a high selection pressure only. A lack of self-organization is also seen at region borders."

At the time of its discovery in 1998 the source was observed in a low/hard state, showing a hard tail with a high energy cutoff of 70 keV. About two years later the source reappeared about one order of magnitude brighter in the X-rays (0.5-10 keV) and with a significantly steeper spectrum. As was the case for the low state, the data could be fitted by an input model based on two continuum primary components: a) a soft thermal excess, which is ~4 times more luminous than the one found in hard state; b) a non-thermal component which is compatible with either a power-law or a comptonization spectrum. The soft component is equally well described by pure blackbody or multi-color disk emission, with significantly higher temperature than observed in low state (~1.3 vs. the ~0.5 keV assuming pure blackbody). For this model, the flux of the non-thermal component below ~10 keV is a significant fraction of the total X-ray flux, i.e. greater than ~50% in the 2-10 keV band."

        "Abstract": "The early work of Lorentz, Abraham and others, evolved through the work of Fokker, Dirac and others to ultimately culminate in the Feynman- Wheeler direct action at a distance theory. However this theory has encountered certain conceptual difficulties like non-locality in time, self force of the electron, pre acceleration and the perfect absorption condition of Feynman and Wheeler, that is the instantaneous action of the remaining charges in the universe on the charge in question. More recently, Hoyle and Narlikar have resurrected this theory, but within the context of a Steady State or Quasi Steady State cosmology. They argue that the theory infact has a better standing than the generally accepted quantum theoretic description. In this article we consider a quantum theoretic description and a cosmology which parallels the Hoyle-Narlikar approach. This leads to a synthesis and justification of the Dirac and Feynman-Wheeler approaches, clarifying the conceptual problems in the process. We deduce a scenario with quantized space-time and a holistic cosmology, consistent with physical and astrophysical data. The non-locality is now seen to be meaningful within the minimum space-time intervals, as also the perfect absorption within the holistic description. Local realism, and the usual causal field theory are seen to have an underpinning of direct action. For example this is brought out by the virtual photons which mediate interactions in Quantum Electro Dynamics, and the emergence of the inverse square law in the above approach from a background Zero Point Field."

These conditions show how to construct approximate factor models for such a SLLN to hold and that a PCS is almost sufficient and necessary for this purpose. The validity of the SLLN implies that the false discovery proportion (FDP) of the conditional procedure eventually is the same as its expectation almost surely. We also provide conditions that characterize the type of dependence under which the sequences of rejections and FDP of the marginal MTP satisfy a SLLN."

This equation is the standard linearized conjugacy equation for germs of holomorphic maps in a neighborhood of a fixed point. The parameter is the eigenvalue $q$ of the linear part. This problem has been first investigated by Arnol'd and Herman. Herman raised the question whether the solutions of the cohomological equation had a quasianalytic dependence on the parameter. Indeed they are analytic outside $\\S^1$ which is a natural boundary but the solutions are still defined at points of $\\S^1$ which lie ``far enough from resonances''. We adapt to our case Herman's construction of an increasing sequence of compacts which avoid resonances and prove that the solutions belong to the associated space of monogenic functions. The solutions admit asymptotic expansions at the points of $\\S^1$ which satisfy some arithmetical condition, and Carleman's Theorem allows us to answer negatively to the question of quasianalyticity at these points. But resonances (roots of unity) lead to asymptotic expansions, for which quasianalyticity is obtained as a particular case of \\'Ecalle's theory of resurgent functions. At constant-type points one can still recover the solutions from their asymptotic expansions and obtain a special kind of quasianalyticity. Our results are obtained by reducing the problem to the study of a fundamental solution (which is the ``quantum logarithm''). We deduce as a corollary of our work the proof of a conjecture of Gammel on the monogenic and quasianalytic properties of a certain number-theoretical Borel-Wolff-Denjoy series."

We obtain these Jacquet-Langlands correspondences by studying the bad reduction of a Shimura variety X attached to G at a prime p for which X has maximal parabolic level structure. We construct a \"Deligne-Rapoport\" model for X and show that the irreducible components of its special fiber have a global structure that can be explicitly described in terms of Shimura varieties X' for unitary groups G' isomorphic to G except at infinity.   The weight spectral sequence of Rapoport-Zink then yields an expression for certain pieces of the weight filtration on the etale cohomology of X in terms of the cohomology of a suitable X'. This identifies a piece of this weight filtration with a space of algebraic modular forms for G'. A consequence is certain cases of the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence between G and G' in terms of a canonical isomorphism between spaces of arithmetic interest, rather than simply as an abstract bijection between isomorphism classes of representations."

After exploring a subset of items, the agent chooses one and obtains a payoff equal to its value minus the search cost. We consider a sequential model of consumer search in which agents' values are correlated and each agent updates her priors based on the exploration of past agents before performing her search. Specifically, we assume the value is the sum of a common-value component, called the quality, and a subjective score. Fixing the variance of the total value, we say a population is more diverse if the subjective score has a larger variance. We ask how diversity impacts average utility. We show that intermediate diversity levels yield significantly higher social utility than the extreme cases of no diversity (when agents under-explore) or full diversity (when agents are unable to learn from each other) and quantify how the impact of the diversity level changes depending on the time spent searching."

In this paper, we consider multi-quality multicast of a 360 VR video from a single server to multiple users using time division multiple access (TDMA). To improve transmission efficiency, tiling is adopted, and each tile is pre-encoded into multiple representations with different qualities. We optimize the quality level selection, transmission time allocation and transmission power allocation to maximize the total utility of all users under the transmission time and power allocation constraints as well as the quality smoothness constraints for mixed-quality tiles. The problem is a challenging mixed discrete-continuous opti-mization problem.

A full study has been done for spherical particles with a +-20% size distribution. Stick-slip motion due to repetitive fluidization of the layer occurs for low driving velocities. Between major slip events, slight creep occurs that is variable from one event to the next. The effects of changing the stiffness k and velocity V of the driving system are studied in detail. The stick-slip motion is almost periodic for spherical particles over a wide range of parameters, but becomes irregular when k is large and V is relatively small. At larger V, the motion becomes smoother and is affected by the inertia of the upper plate bounding the layer. Measurements of the period T and amplitude A of the relative motion are presented as a function of V. At a critical value Vc, a transition to continuous sliding motion occurs that is discontinuous for k not too large. The time dependence of the instantaneous velocity of the upper plate and the frictional force produced by the granular layer are determined within individual slipping events. The force is a multi-valued function of the instantaneous velocity, with pronounced hysteresis and a sudden drop prior to resticking. Measurements of vertical displacement reveal a small dilation of the material (about one tenth of the mean particle size in a layer 20 particles deep) associated with each slip event. Finally, optical imaging reveals that localized microscopic rearrangements precede (and follow) each slip event. The behavior of smooth particles is contrasted with that of rough particles."

This paper is a more systematic investigation of C*-algebras with the APFP. We prove various properties of such algebras. For example: They have connected invertible group, trivial K_1, and stable rank 1. In the unital case, the K_0 group separates the tracial states. The APFP passes to matrix algebras. and if I is an ideal in A such that I and A/I have the APFP, then so does A. We also give some new examples of C*-algebras with the APFP, including type II_1 factors and infinite-dimensional simple unital direct limits with slow dimension growth, real rank zero, and trivial K_1 group. An infinite- dimensional simple unital direct limit with slow dimension growth and with the APFP must have real rank zero, but we also give examples of unital algebras with the APFP which do not have real rank zero.   Our analysis also leads to the introduction of a new concept of rank for a C*-algebra that may be of interest in the future."

The spectrum of this object can be described by a blackbody model with the temperature kT=404 eV and radius of the emitting region R=0.28 km, at a distance of 1 kpc. Power-law and thermal plasma models do not fit the source spectrum. The spectrum shows a marginally significant feature at 1.68 keV. Search for periodicity yields two candidate periods, about 301 ms and 33 ms, both significant at a 2.1 sigma level; the corresponding pulsed fractions are 13% and 9%, respectively.

It could be either a neutron star with a low or regular magnetic field, slowly accreting from a fossil disk, or, more likely, an isolated neutron star with a superstrong magnetic field.

In particular, we investigate how the time evolution of the equivalent widths of [OII]$\\lambda$3727 and H$\\delta$ is controlled by the adopted age dependence. This leads to three main results: (1) If a young stellar population (with the age of $\\sim$ $10^6$ yr) is more heavily obscured by dust than an old one ($>$ $10^8$ yr), the galaxy can show an ``e(a)'' spectrum characterized by strong H$\\delta$ absorption and relatively modest [OII] emission. (2) A dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a) spectrum can evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k (or k+a) spectrum 0.2 Gyr after the starburst and then into a passive one with a k-type spectrum 1 Gyr after the starburst. This result clearly demonstrates an evolutionary link between galaxies with different spectral classes (i.e., e(b), e(a), a+k, k+a, and k). (3) A dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum even in the dusty starburst phase if the age-dependence of dust extinction is rather weak, i.e., if young starburst populations with different ages ($\\le$ $10^7$ yr) are uniformly obscured by dust."

        "Abstract": "We study the effect of spin-Peierls instability on the phase-diagram of a frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ladder, with weak transverse and diagonal rung coupling. Our analysis focuses on a one-dimensional version of the model (i.e. a single two-leg ladder) where we consider two forms of spin-Peierls (SP) instabilities on the legs: columnar dimers (CD) and staggered dimers (SD). We particularly examine the regime of parameters (corresponding to an intermediate XXZ anisotropy) where the SP and rung coupling terms are equally relevant. In both the CD and SD cases we find that the effective field theory describing the system is a self-dual sine-Gordon model, which favors ordering and the opening of a gap to excitations. The order parameter, which reflects the interplay between the SP and rung interactions, represents a crystal of 4-spin plaquettes on which longitudinal and transverse dimers are in a superposition. Depending on the SP instability mode these plaquettes are closed or open, however both types spontaneously break reflection symmetry across the ladder. The closed plaquettes are stable, while the open plaquette-order is relatively fragile and the corresponding gap may be tuned to zero under extreme conditions. We further find that a first order transition occurs from the Plaquette order to a valence bond crystal (VBC) of dimers on the legs. It is suggestive that in a higher dimensional version of this system, this variety of distinct VBC states with comparable energies leads to the formation of domains. Effectively one-dimensional gapless spinon modes on domain boundaries can possibly account for the experimental observation of a spin-liquid behavior in a physical realization of the model."

        "Abstract": "We study a 2D lattice model of forward-directed waves in which the integrated intensity for classical waves (or probability for quantum mechanical particles) is conserved. The model describes the time evolution of 1D quantum particle in a time-varying potential and also applies to propagation of electromagnetic waves in two dimensions within the parabolic approximation. We present a closed form solution for propagation in a uniform system. Motivated by recent studies of non-unitary directed models for localized 2D electrons tunneling in a magnetic field, we then address related theoretical questions of how the interference pattern between constrained-forward paths in this unitary model is affected by the addition of phases corresponding to such a magnetic field. The behavior is found to depend sensitively on the value of $\\Phi/\\Phi_{0}$, where $\\Phi$ is flux per plaquette and $\\Phi_{0}$ is the unit of flux quantum. For $\\Phi/\\Phi_{0} = p/q$ we find the amplitude to be more collimated the larger is the value of $q$. We next consider propagation in a random forward scattering media. In particular the scaling properties associated with the transverse width $x$ of the wave, as function of its distance $t$ from point source, are addressed. We find the moments of $x$ to scale with $t$ in a very different way from what is known for either off-lattice unitary or on-lattice non-unitary systems. The scaling of the moments of the probability $[P^{n}(x,t)]$ (or intensity) at a point $(x=0,t)$ is found to be consistent with a simple behavior $[P^{n}(0,t)] \\sim t^{-\\frac{n}{2}}$.

        "Title": "Constrained Overcomplete Analysis Operator Learning for Cosparse Signal  Modelling",
        "Abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a low-dimensional signal model from a collection of training samples. The mainstream approach would be to learn an overcomplete dictionary to provide good approximations of the training samples using sparse synthesis coefficients. This famous sparse model has a less well known counterpart, in analysis form, called the cosparse analysis model. In this new model, signals are characterised by their parsimony in a transformed domain using an overcomplete (linear) analysis operator. We propose to learn an analysis operator from a training corpus using a constrained optimisation framework based on L1 optimisation. The reason for introducing a constraint in the optimisation framework is to exclude trivial solutions. Although there is no final answer here for which constraint is the most relevant constraint, we investigate some conventional constraints in the model adaptation field and use the uniformly normalised tight frame (UNTF) for this purpose. We then derive a practical learning algorithm, based on projected subgradients and Douglas-Rachford splitting technique, and demonstrate its ability to robustly recover a ground truth analysis operator, when provided with a clean training set, of sufficient size. We also find an analysis operator for images, using some noisy cosparse signals, which is indeed a more realistic experiment. As the derived optimisation problem is not a convex program, we often find a local minimum using such variational methods. Some local optimality conditions are derived for two different settings, providing preliminary theoretical support for the well-posedness of the learning problem under appropriate conditions."

The key analytical tool is the singular value expansion of the parameterized solution, which we approximate with a singular value decomposition of a parameter snapshot matrix. To evaluate the reduced-order model at a new parameter, we interpolate a subset of the right singular vectors to generate the reduced-order model's coefficients. We employ a novel method to select this subset that uses the parameter gradient of the right singular vectors to split the terms in the expansion yielding a mean prediction and a prediction covariance---similar to a Gaussian process approximation. The covariance serves as a confidence measure for the reduce order model. We demonstrate the efficacy of the reduced-order model using a parameter study of heat transfer in random media. The high-fidelity simulations produce more than 4TB of data; we compute the singular value decomposition and evaluate the reduced-order model using scalable MapReduce/Hadoop implementations. We compare the accuracy of our method with a scalar response surface on a set of temperature profile measurements and find that our model better captures sharp, local features in the parameter space."

The result is obtained by a careful study of spectral properties of a one-parametric family of convolution operators on L.

For a planar embedding of a 2-connected bipartite planar graph $G$ which has a perfect matching, the concept of Clar number of hexagonal system had been extended by Abeledo and Atkinson as follows: a spanning subgraph $C$ of is called a Clar cover of $G$ if each of its components is either an even face or an edge, the maximum number of even faces in Clar covers of $G$ is called Clar number of $G$, and the Clar cover with the maximum number of even faces is called the maximum Clar cover. It was proved that if $G$ is a hexagonal system with a perfect matching $M$ and $K'$ is a set of hexagons in a maximum Clar cover of $G$, then $G-K'$ has a unique 1-factor. Using this result, Xu {\\it et. at.} proved that the maximum forcing number of the elementary hexagonal system are equal to their Clar numbers, and then the maximum forcing number of the elementary hexagonal system can be computed in polynomial time. In this paper, we show that an elementary polyomino has a unique perfect matching when removing the set of tetragons from its maximum Clar cover. Thus the maximum forcing number of elementary polyomino equals to its Clar number and can be computed in polynomial time.

This minimal B-L MSSM can have a colored/charged LSP, of which a stop LSP is the most amenable to observation at the LHC. We study the R-parity violating decays of a stop LSP into a bottom quark and charged leptons--the dominant modes for a generic \"admixture\" stop. A numerical analysis of the relative branching ratios of these decay channels is given using a wide scan over the parameter space. The fact that R-parity is violated in this theory by a vacuum expectation value of a sneutrino links these branching ratios directly to the neutrino mass hierarchy. It is shown how a discovery of bottom-charged lepton events at the LHC can potentially determine whether the neutrino masses are in a normal or inverted hierarchy, as well as determining the theta_23 neutrino mixing angle. Finally, present LHC bounds on these leptoquark signatures are used to put lower bounds on the stop mass."

This model is obtained by adding an interaction term with a typical scale to a scale invariant system. A distribution derived in the model provides power law one in the large scale region, but Weibull-like one in the small scale region. As examples of distributions which have both fractal and non-fractal regions, we take those of personal income and citation number of scientific papers. We show that these distributions are fitted fairly well by the distribution curves derived analytically in the $R^2$ 2d gravity model. As a result, we consider that the typical scale is a useful concept to understand various distributions observed in the real world in a unified way. We also point out that the $R^2$ 2d gravity model provides us with an effective tool to read the typical scales of various distributions in a systematic way."

The dynamical space-time theories are introduced a vector field whose equation of motion guarantees a conservation of a certain Energy Momentum tensor, which may be related, but in general is not the same as the gravitational Energy Momentum tensor. This particular energy momentum tensor is built from a general combination of scalar fields derivatives as the kinetic terms, and possibly potentials for the scalar field. By demanding that the dynamical space vector field be the gradient of a scalar the dynamical space time theory becomes a theory for diffusive interacting dark energy and dark matter. These generalizations produce non-conserved energy momentum tensors instead of conserved energy momentum tensors which leads at the end to a formulation for interacting DE-DM. We solved analytically the theories and we show that the $\\Lambda$CDM is a fixed point of these theories at large times. A particular case has asymptotic correspondence to previously studied non-Lagrangian formulations of diffusive exchange between dark energy dark matter."

This paper is a more systematic investigation of C*-algebras with the APFP. We prove various properties of such algebras. For example: They have connected invertible group, trivial K_1, and stable rank 1. In the unital case, the K_0 group separates the tracial states. The APFP passes to matrix algebras. and if I is an ideal in A such that I and A/I have the APFP, then so does A. We also give some new examples of C*-algebras with the APFP, including type II_1 factors and infinite-dimensional simple unital direct limits with slow dimension growth, real rank zero, and trivial K_1 group. An infinite- dimensional simple unital direct limit with slow dimension growth and with the APFP must have real rank zero, but we also give examples of unital algebras with the APFP which do not have real rank zero.

The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

To shed light on the interactions between stem and non-stem cancer cell populations we develop a two-population mathematical model, which is suitable to describe tumorsphere growth. Both interspecific and intraspecific interactions, mediated by the microenvironment, are included. We show that there is a tipping point, characterized by a transcritical bifurcation, where a purely non-stem cell attractor is replaced by a new attractor that contains both stem and differentiated cancer cells. The model is then applied to describe the outcome of a recent experiment. This description reveals that, while the intraspecific interactions are inhibitory, the interspecific interactions stimulate growth. This can be understood in terms of stem cells needing differentiated cells to reinforce their niches, and phenotypic plasticity favoring the de-differentiation of differentiated cells into cancer stem cells. We posit that this is a consequence of the deregulation of the quorum sensing that maintains homeostasis in healthy tissues."

Gauge field Poisson brackets differ from the Heisenberg algebra, but are reminiscent of Yang-Mills theory on a null surface. Enstrophy invariants are Casimirs of the Poisson algebra of gauge invariant observables. Some symplectic leaves of the Poisson manifold are identified. The Hamiltonian is a magnetic energy, similar to that of electrodynamics, and depends on a metric whose volume element is not a multiple of mu. The magnetic field evolves by a quadratically non-linear `Euler' equation, which may also be regarded as describing geodesic flow on SDiff(M,mu). Static solutions are obtained. For uniform mu, an infinite sequence of local conserved charges beginning with the hamiltonian are found. The charges are shown to be in involution, suggesting integrability. Besides being a theory of a novel kind of ideal flow, this is a toy-model for Yang-Mills theory and matrix field theories, whose gauge-invariant phase space is conjectured to be a coadjoint orbit of the diffeomorphism group of a non-commutative space."

It is shown that most capture orbits behave chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the values of $\\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron separation at capture.   If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly bound, highly eccentric phase.   If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.   We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \\& Paczy\\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\\odot$.

        "Abstract": "We undertake a detailed study of the sets of multiplicity in a second countable locally compact group $G$ and their operator versions. We establish a symbolic calculus for normal completely bounded maps from the space $\\mathcal{B}(L^2(G))$ of bounded linear operators on $L^2(G)$ into the von Neumann algebra $VN(G)$ of $G$ and use it to show that a closed subset $E\\subseteq G$ is a set of multiplicity if and only if the set $E^* = \\{(s,t)\\in G\\times G : ts^{-1}\\in E\\}$ is a set of operator multiplicity. Analogous results are established for $M_1$-sets and $M_0$-sets. We show that the property of being a set of multiplicity is preserved under various operations, including taking direct products, and establish an Inverse Image Theorem for such sets. We characterise the sets of finite width that are also sets of operator multiplicity, and show that every compact operator supported on a set of finite width can be approximated by sums of rank one operators supported on the same set. We show that, if $G$ satisfies a mild approximation condition, pointwise multiplication by a given measurable function $\\psi : G\\to \\mathbb{C}$ defines a closable multiplier on the reduced C*-algebra $C_r^*(G)$ of $G$ if and only if Schur multiplication by the function $N(\\psi) : G\\times G\\to \\mathbb{C}$, given by $N(\\psi)(s,t) = \\psi(ts^{-1})$, is a closable operator when viewed as a densely defined linear map on the space of compact operators on $L^2(G)$. Similar results are obtained for multipliers on $VN(G)$."

        "Abstract": "Software product line (SPL) engineers put a lot of effort to ensure that, through the setting of a large number of possible configuration options, products are acceptable and well-tailored to customers' needs. Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning techniques are increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance."

The use of nanometric probes enables local field emission measurements allowing investigation of effects non detectable with a conventional parallel plate setup, where the emission current is averaged on a large sample area. The micrometric inter-electrode distance let achieve high electric fields with a modest voltage source. Those features allowed us to characterize field emission for macroscopic electric fields up to 250 V/$\\mu$m and attain current densities larger than 10$^5$ A/cm$^2$. FE behaviour is analyzed in the framework of the Fowler-Nordheim theory. A field enhancement factor $\\gamma \\approx$ 40-50 and a turn-on field $E_{turn-on} \\sim$15 V/$\\mu$m at an inter-electrode distance of 1 $\\mu$m are estimated. Current saturation observed at high voltages in the I-V characteristics is explained in terms of a series resistance of the order of M$\\Omega$. Additional effects as electrical conditioning, CNT degradation, response to laser irradiation and time stability are investigated and discussed."

In this first part, we set up the topological operads/PROPs and their cell models. The main theorems of this part are that there is a cell model operad for the moduli space of genus $g$ curves with $n$ punctures and a tangent vector at each of these punctures and that there exists a CW complex whose chains are isomorphic to a certain type of Sullivan Chord diagrams and that they form a PROP. Furthermore there exist weak versions of these structures on the topological level which all lie inside an all encompassing cyclic (rational) operad."

        "Abstract": "From the microscopic theory, we derive a number conserving quantum kinetic equation, valid for a dilute Bose gas at any temperature, in which the binary collisions between the quasi-particles are mediated by phonon-like excitations (called ``condenson''). This different approach starts from the many-body Hamiltonian of a Boson gas and uses, in an appropriate way, the generalized random phase approximation. As a result, the collision term of the kinetic equation contains higher order contributions in the expansion in the interaction parameter. This different expansion shows up that a scattering involves the emission and the absorption of a phonon-like excitation. The major interest of this particular mechanism is that, in a regime where the condensate is stable, the collision process between condensed and non condensed particles is totally blocked due to a total annihilation of the mutual interaction potential induced by the condensate itself. As a consequence, the condensate is not constrained to relax and can be superfluid. Furthermore, a Boltzmann-like H-theorem for the entropy exists for this equation and allows to distinguish between dissipative and non dissipative phenomena (like vortices). We also illustrate the analogy between this approach and the kinetic theory for a plasma, in which the excitations correspond precisely to a plasmon. Finally, we show the equivalence of this theory with the non-number conserving Bogoliubov theory at zero temperature."

        "Abstract": "We analyse those objects in the Brightest 55 sample of clusters of galaxies which have a short central cooling time and a central temperature drop. Such clusters are likely to require some form of heating. Where clear radio bubbles are observed in these clusters, their energy injection is compared to the X-ray cooling rate. Of the 20 clusters requiring heating, at least 14 have clear bubbles, implying a duty cycle for the bubbling activity of at least 70 per cent. The average distance out to which the bubbles can offset the X-ray cooling, r_heat is given by r_heat/r_cool=0.86+/-0.11 where r_cool is defined as the radius as which the radiative cooling time is 3 Gyr. 10 out of 16 clusters have r_heat/r_cool>1, but there is a large range in values. The clusters which require heating but show no clear bubbles were combined with those clusters which have a radio core to form a second sub-sample. Using r_heat=0.86 r_cool we calculate the size of an average bubble expected in these clusters. In five cases (3C129.1, A2063, A2204, A3112 and A3391) the radio morphology is bi-lobed and its extent similar to the expected bubble sizes. A comparison between the actual bubble size and the maximum expected if they were to offset the X-ray cooling exactly, R_max, shows a peak at R_bubble ~ 0.7 R_max with a tail extending to larger R_bubble/R_max. The offset from the expected value of R_bubble ~ R_max may indicate the presence of a non-thermal component in the innermost ICM of most clusters, with a pressure comparable to the thermal pressure."

        "Abstract": "We report on optical, near-infrared and centimeter radio observations of GRB000418 which allow us to follow the evolution of the afterglow from 2 to 200 days after the gamma-ray burst. In modeling these broad-band data, we find that an isotropic explosion in a constant density medium is unable to simultaneously fit both the radio and optical data. However, a jet-like outflow with an opening angle of 10-20 degress provides a good description of the data. The evidence in favor of a jet interpretation is based on the behavior of the radio light curves, since the expected jet break is masked at optical wavelengths by the light of the host galaxy. We also find evidence for extinction, presumably arising from within the host galaxy, with A(V)=0.4 mag, and host flux densities of F_R=1.1 uJy and F_K=1.7 uJy. These values supercede previous work on this burst due to the availability of a broad-band data set allowing a global fitting approach. A model in which the GRB explodes into a wind-stratified circumburst medium cannot be ruled out by these data. However, in examining a sample of other bursts (e.g. GRB990510, GRB000301C) we favor the jet interpretation for GRB000418."

        "Abstract": "The radio source 3C84, in NGC1275, has a two sided structure on parsec scales. The northern feature, presumed to be associated with a jet moving away from the Earth, shows strong evidence for free-free absorption. The ionized gas responsible for that absorption would be a source of detectable stimulated recombination line emission for a wide range of physical conditions. The VLBA has been used to search for the H65$\\alpha$ hydrogen recombination line. The line is only expected to be seen against the northern feature which contains a small fraction of the total radio flux density. This spatial discrimination significantly aids the search for a weak line. No line was seen, with upper limits of roughly 15% of the continuum over a velocity range of 1486 km/s with resolutions up to 6.6 km/s. In the absence of a strong radiation field, this would imply that the free-free absorbing gas has a wide velocity width, is moving rapidly relative to the systemic velocity, or is concentrated in a thin, high density structure. All of these possibilities are reasonably likely close to an AGN. However, in the intense radiation environment of the AGN, even considering only the radiation we actually observe passing through the free-free absorbing gas, the non-detection is probably assured by a combination of saturation and radiation damping."

The approximate solution is sought in a finite dimensional subspace of U, and test functions are taken in a finite dimensional subspace of V. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition on the form a for convergence of the Galerkin approximation, which is also equivalent to convergence of the Galerkin approximation for the adjoint problem. We also investigate some connections between Galerkin approximation and the approximation property from geometry of Banach spaces. In the case of Hilbert spaces, we prove that the only bilinear or sesquilinear forms for which any Galerkin approximation converges (this property is called the universal Galerkin property) are the essentially coercive forms. In this case, a generalization of the Aubin-Nitsche Theorem leads to optimal a priori estimates in terms of regularity properties of the right-hand side L, as shown by several applications."

Stimulated Brillouin scattering, which was recently demonstrated in silicon, is a particularly powerful approach to induce a phase shift due to its inherent flexibility, offering an optically controllable and selective phase shift. However, to date, only moderate amounts of Brillouin gain has been achieved and theoretically this would restrict the phase shift to a few tens of degrees, significantly less than the required 360 degrees. Here, we overcome this limitation with a phase enhancement method using RF interference, showing a 360 degrees broadband phase shifter based on Brillouin scattering in a suspended silicon waveguide. We achieve a full 360 degrees phase-shift over a bandwidth of 15 GHz using a phase enhancement factor of 25, thereby enabling practical broadband Brillouin phase shifter for beam forming and other applications."

RXTE also resolves the Fe K-alpha fluorescence line with FWHM ~48,000 km s^{-1}. This measurement provides the first independent confirmation of ASCA detections in Seyfert galaxies of broad Fe K-alpha lines that are thought to be the signature of emission from the inner regions of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole. Under the assumption that reflection arises from an isotropic source located above a neutral accretion disk, and using a theoretical model that accounts for the dependence of the reflected spectrum on inclination angle, we derive a 90% confidence range for the disk inclination of i = 50 to 81 degrees. The large inclination is consistent with that expected from the unified model for MCG-5-23-16 based on its Seyfert 1.9 classification. If we assume that the high-energy cutoff in the incident spectrum lies at energies larger than a few hundred keV, then the equivalent width of the Fe K-alpha line is much larger than predicted for the amount of reflection. This implies either an enhanced iron abundance, a covering factor of reflecting material > 0.5, or a cutoff in the incident spectrum at energies between ~60 and ~200 keV."

Starting from a well-defined model Hamiltonian, which includes the effects of driving current and dissipative coupling to a heat bath, we write down the Heisenberg equations of motion for the variables of the Josephson junction and the cavity mode. In the limit of many photons, these equations reduce to coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically. We present a review of some characteristic numerical results, which show many features similar to experiment. These include self-induced resonant steps (SIRS's) at voltages $V = n\\hbar\\Omega/(2e)$, where $\\Omega$ is the cavity frequency, and $n$ is generally an integer; a threshold number $N_c$ of active rows of junctions above which the array is coherent; and a time-averaged cavity energy which is quadratic in the number of active junctions, when the array is above threshold. When the array is biased on a SIRS, then, for given junction parameters, the power radiated into the array varies as the square of the number of active junctions, consistent with expectations for coherent radiation. For a given step, a two-dimensional array radiates much more energy into the cavity than does a one-dimensional array. Finally, in two dimensions, we find a strong polarization effect: if the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to the direction of current injection in a square array, then it does not couple to the array and no power is radiated into the cavity."

In particular, the lattice deformations resulting in alternate stronger and weaker couplings along both the principal axes of a square lattice are shown to result in a larger gain in magnetic energy. In addition, a `columnar' configuration is shown to have a lower ground state energy and a faster increase in the energy gap parameter than a `staggered' configuration. The inclusion of unexpanded exchange coupling leads to a power law behaviour for the magnetic energy gain and energy gap, which is qualitatively different from that reported earlier. Instead of increasing as $\\delta ^{x}$, the two quantities depend on $\\delta $ as $\\delta ^{\\nu}/| \\ln \\delta | .$ This is true both in the near critical regime $(0\\leq \\delta \\leq 0.1)$ as well as in the far regime $(0\\leq \\delta <1)$. It is suggested that the unexpanded exchange coupling is as much a source of the logarithmic dependence as a correction due to the contribution of umklapp processes.

Our dataset consists of 186 member stars, 159 of which have good quality velocities, extending to a magnitude V=19.5 with a mean velocity precision of 2 km/s. We find statistically strong evidence of a rising velocity dispersion consistent with a dark matter halo with gently rising rotation curve. There is a <2 sigma signature of rotation about the long axis, inconsistent with tidal disruption being the source of the rising dispersion. By comparing our dataset with earlier velocities, we find that Draco probably has a binary distribution and fraction comparable to those in the solar neighbourhood. We apply a novel maximum likelihood algorithm and fit the velocity data to a two parameter spherical model with an adjustable dark matter content and velocity anisotropy. Draco is best fit by a weakly tangentially anisotropic distribution of stellar orbits in a dark matter halo with a very slowly rising rotation law. We are able to rule out both a mass-follows-light distribution and an extended halo with a harmonic core at the 2.5 to 3 sigma significance level, depending on the details of our assumptions about Draco's stellar binary population. Our modelling lends support to the idea that the dark matter in dwarf spheroidals is distributed in the form of massive, nearly isothermal haloes."

A conceptual foundation for the wave nature of a quantum state has recently been presented, through the notion of quantum coherence. We introduce here a parallel notion for the particle nature of a quantum state of an arbitrary physical situation.

Recent rich observations of GRBs by space missions such as Swift and Fermi pose new constraints on GRB central engine models. In this paper, we study the baryon loading processes of a GRB jet launched from a black hole central engine. We consider a relativistic jet powered by $\\nu \\bar\\nu$-annihilation or by the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We consider baryon loading from a neutrino-driven wind from a neutrino-cooling-dominated accretion flow. For a magnetically dominated BZ jet, we consider neutron-drifting from the magnetic wall surrounding the jet and subsequent positron capture and proton-neutron inelastic collisions. The minumim baryon loads in both types of jet are calculated. We find that in both cases, a more luminous jet tends to be more baryon poor. A neutrino-driven \"fireball\" is typically \"dirtier\" than a magnetically dominated jet, while a magnetically dominated jet can be much cleaner. Both models have the right scaling to interpret the empirical $\\Gamma-L_{\\rm iso}$ relation discovered recently. Since some neutrino-driven jets have too much baryon loading as compared with the data, we suggest that at least a good fraction of GRBs should have a magnetically dominated central engine."

In both cases, the object is treated as a global entity, and a single pose estimate is computed. As a consequence, the resulting techniques can be vulnerable to large occlusions.   In this paper, we introduce a segmentation-driven 6D pose estimation framework where each visible part of the objects contributes a local pose prediction in the form of 2D keypoint locations. We then use a predicted measure of confidence to combine these pose candidates into a robust set of 3D-to-2D correspondences, from which a reliable pose estimate can be obtained. We outperform the state-of-the-art on the challenging Occluded-LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets, which is evidence that our approach deals well with multiple poorly-textured objects occluding each other.

Control actions are then selected from a dense control set according to an objective function that rewards improvements in matching the dataset while also encouraging sparsity. This method is evaluated across several experiments involving real and synthetic datasets, and it is shown to generate smaller control sets when compared to the previous state-of-the-art lattice control set computation technique, with these smaller control sets maintaining a high degree of manoeuvrability in the required task. This results in a planning time speedup of up to 4.31x when using the learned control set over the state-of-the-art computed control set. In addition, we show the learned control sets are better able to capture the driving style of the dataset in terms of path curvature."

We first consider a lens model that consists of a clump modeled as a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and a primary lens modeled as an external background shear and convergence. For this simple model, we derive analytic formulae for (de)magnification of circularly symmetric top-hat sources with three types of parity for their lensed images, namely, positive, negative, and doubly negative parities. Provided that the source size is sufficiently larger than the Einstein radius of the SIS, we find that in the positive (doubly negative) parity case, an extended source is always magnified (demagnified) in comparison with the unperturbed macrolens system, whereas in the negative parity case, the (de)magnification effect, which depends on the sign of convergence minus unity is weaker than those in other parities. It is shown that a measurement of the distortion pattern in a multiply lensed image enables us to break the degeneracy between the lensing effects of clump mass and those of clump distance if lensing parameters of the relevant macrolens model are determined from the position and flux of multiple images. We also show that an actual density profile of a clump can be directly measured by analyzing the ``fine structure'' in a multiply lensed image within the Einstein radius of the clump."

The formulation aims to ensure that the universal distribution does not underestimate the probability of any element in the support set relative to distributions in the collection. When the alphabet is uncountable and we have a collection $\\cal P$ of Lebesgue continuous measures instead, we ask if there is a corresponding universal probability density function (pdf) that does not underestimate the value of the density function at any point in the support relative to pdfs in $\\cal P$.   Analogous to the worst case redundancy of a collection of distributions over a countable alphabet, we define the \\textit{attenuation} of a class to be $A$ when the worst case optimal universal pdf at any point $x$ in the support is always at least the value any pdf in the collection $\\cal P$ assigns to $x$ divided by $A$. We analyze the attenuation of the worst optimal universal pdf over length-$n$ samples generated \\textit{i.i.d.} from a Gaussian distribution whose mean can be anywhere between $-\\alpha/2$ to $\\alpha/2$ and variance between $\\sigma_m^2$ and $\\sigma_M^2$. We show that this attenuation is finite, grows with the number of samples as ${\\cal O}(n)$, and also specify the attentuation exactly without approximations. When only one parameter is allowed to vary, we show that the attenuation grows as ${\\cal O}(\\sqrt{n})$, again keeping in line with results from prior literature that fix the order of magnitude as a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$ per parameter. In addition, we also specify the attenuation exactly without approximation when only the mean or only the variance is allowed to vary."

        "Abstract": "The onset of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is studied a compressible Brownian Yukawa fluid mixture on the ``molecular'' length and time scales of the individual particles. As a model, a two-dimensional phase-separated symmetric binary mixture of colloidal particles of type $A$ and $B$ with a fluid-fluid interface separating an $A$-rich phase from a $B$-rich phase is investigated by Brownian computer simulations when brought into non-equilibrium via a constant external driving field which acts differently on the different particles and perpendicular to the interface. Two different scenarios are observed which occur either for high or for low interfacial free energies as compared to the driving force. In the first scenario for high interfacial tension, the critical wavelength $\\lambda_c$ of the unstable interface modes is in good agreement with the classical Rayleigh-Taylor formula provided dynamically rescaled values for the interfacial tension are used. The wavelength $\\lambda_{c}$ increases with time representing a self-healing effect of the interface due to a local density increase near the interface. The Rayleigh-Taylor formula is confirmed even if $\\lambda_c$ is of the order of a molecular correlation length. In the second scenario for very large driving forces as compared to the interfacial line tensions, on the other hand, the particle penetrate easily the interface by the driving field and form microscopic lanes with a width different from the predictions of the classical Rayleigh-Taylor formula."

        "Abstract": "The possibility of a quantum system to exhibit properties that are akin to both the classically held notions of being a particle and a wave, is one of the most intriguing aspects of the quantum description of nature. These aspects have been instrumental in understanding paradigmatic natural phenomena as well as to provide nonclassical applications. A conceptual foundation for the wave nature of a quantum state has recently been presented, through the notion of quantum coherence. We introduce here a parallel notion for the particle nature of a quantum state of an arbitrary physical situation. We provide hints towards a resource theory of particleness, and give a quantification of the same. Finally, we provide evidence for a complementarity between the particleness thus introduced, and the coherence of an arbitrary quantum state."

As a result, highly accurate recommendations are not sufficient unless they are also specific to users. Moreover, fashion data is characterized by a large majority of new users, so a recommendation strategy that performs well only for users with prior interaction history is a poor fit to the fashion problem. Critical to addressing these issues in fashion recommendation is an evaluation strategy that: 1) includes multiple metrics that are relevant to fashion, and 2) is performed within segments of users with different interaction histories. Here, we present our multifaceted offline strategy for evaluating fashion RS. Using our proposed evaluation methodology, we compare the performance of three different algorithms, a most popular (MP) items strategy, a collaborative filtering (CF) strategy, and a content-based (CB) strategy. We demonstrate that only by considering the performance of these algorithms across multiple metrics and user segments can we determine the extent to which each algorithm is likely to fulfill fashion users' needs."

        "Abstract": "We study the distribution of bright star-forming complexes in a homogeneous sample of 72 late-type (``irregular'') dwarf galaxies located within the 10 Mpc volume. Star-forming complexes are identified as bright lumps in B-band galaxy images and isolated by means of the unsharp-masking method. For the sample as a whole the radial number distribution of bright lumps largely traces the underlying exponential-disk light profiles, but peaks at a 10 percent smaller scale length. Moreover, the presence of a tail of star forming regions out to at least six optical scale lengths provides evidence against a systematic star formation truncation within that galaxy extension. Considering these findings, we apply a scale length-independent concentration index, taking into account the implied non-uniform random spread of star formation regions throughout the disk. The number profiles frequently manifest a second, minor peak at about two scale lengths. Relying on a two-dimensional stochastic self-propagating star formation model, we show these secondary peaks to be consistent with triggered star formation; for a few of the brighter galaxies a peculiar peak distribution is observed that is conceivably due to the onset of shear provided by differential rotation. On scales between 100 and 1000 pc, and by taking into account exponential-disk structure, bright lumps reveal cluster dimensions between 1.3 and 2, with a weak trend to higher dimensions for brighter galaxies. Interpreting cluster dimension in terms of porosity of a self-similar intragalactic medium, we derive a relation between current star formation rate, scale length, and porosity."

        "Abstract": "We present optical and near-IR identification and spectroscopy of the host galaxy of GRB 980613. The burst was apparently associated with the optically (restframe UV) brightest component of a system of at least five galaxies or galaxy fragments at a redshift of z = 1.0969. The component we identify as the host galaxy shows a moderately high unobscured star formation rate, SFR = 5 M_solar/yr, but a high SFR per unit mass, indicative of a starburst. The image components show a broad range of (R-K) colors, with two of them being very red, possibly due to dust. Overall morphology of the system can be naturally interpreted as a strong tidal interaction of two or more galaxies, at a redshift where such events were much more common than now. Given the well established causal link between galaxy mergers and starbursts, we propose that this is a strong case for a GRB originating from a merger-induced starburst system. This supports the proposed link between GRBs and massive star formation."

If $G$ is Riemannian and $M$ is compact and transversal to an element of $\\mathfrak g$, we show that it is a lateral class of a closed embedded Lie subgroup of $G$; we also do this if $G$ is Lorentzian, provided $M$ has sufficiently large mean curvature. If $G$ is Riemannian semisimple and $M$ is compact, we prove that $M$ has degenerate Gauss map and minimal relative nullity at least 1. We also extend the above results to the case where $M$ is complete and noncompact. For a Riemannian $G$, we show that a minimal $M$ is either transversal to an element of $\\mathfrak g$, hence stable, or has degenerate Gauss map and minimal relative nullity at least 1; for $M$ cmc and transversal to an element of $\\mathfrak g$, if we ask the immersion to be proper and have bounded second fundamental form, then $M$ is also a lateral class of a closed embedded Lie subgroup of $G$, provided a certain growing condition on the size of the corresponding Gauss map is satisfied. Finally, for a Lorentzian group $G$, with sectional curvatures bounded from above on Lorentzian planes, we extend a result of Y.

        "Abstract": "We develop a learning framework for building deformable templates, which play a fundamental role in many image analysis and computational anatomy tasks. Conventional methods for template creation and image alignment to the template have undergone decades of rich technical development. In these frameworks, templates are constructed using an iterative process of template estimation and alignment, which is often computationally very expensive. Due in part to this shortcoming, most methods compute a single template for the entire population of images, or a few templates for specific sub-groups of the data. In this work, we present a probabilistic model and efficient learning strategy that yields either universal or conditional templates, jointly with a neural network that provides efficient alignment of the images to these templates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on a variety of domains, with a special focus on neuroimaging. This is particularly useful for clinical applications where a pre-existing template does not exist, or creating a new one with traditional methods can be prohibitively expensive.

The system comprises two high-surface brightness arcs with a maximum extent of 3\", bracketing a central object which we identify as a massive early-type galaxy at z=0.73. We construct a lens model which reproduces the main features of the system using a combination of a galaxy-scale lens and the foreground cluster. We show that the morphological, spectral and photometric properties of the arcs are consistent with them arising from the lensing of a single ~L* LBG. The most important feature of this system is that the lensing magnification results in an apparent magnitude of r=20.3, making this one of the brightest LBGs known. Such a high magnification provides the opportunity of obtaining very high signal to noise (and potentially spatially resolved) spectroscopy of a high redshift galaxy to study its physical properties. We present initial imaging and spectroscopy demonstrating the basic properties of the system and discuss the opportunities for future observations."

        "Title": "Nonlinear Instabilities in Shock-Bounded Slabs",
        "Abstract": "(substantial changes to section 3.2, otherwise minor) We present an analysis of the hydrodynamic stability of a cold slab bounded by two accretion shocks. Previous numerical work has shown that when the Mach number of the shock is large the slab is unstable. Here we show that to linear order both the bending and breathing modes of such a slab are stable. However, nonlinear effects will tend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab displacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear instability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for small bending angles, is $\\sim c_sk (k\\eta)^{1/2}$, where $\\eta$ is the slab displacement. When the bending angle is large the slab will contain a local vorticity comparable to $c_s/L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. We discuss the implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs. Finally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock and a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case is stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a nonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock bounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce substructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the sound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab thickness."

The models studied include not only a spherically symmetric hot matter shell with constant particle number but also a black hole characterized by a general thermal equation of state. These examples illustrate the formal structure of thermodynamics developed by Callen as applied to a gravitational configuration as well as the phenomenological manner in which Einstein equations largely determine the thermodynamical equations of state. We consider in detail the thermodynamics and quasi-static collapse of a self-gravitating shell. This includes a discussion of intrinsic stability for a one-parameter family of thermal equations of state and the interpretation of the Bekenstein bound. The entropy growth associated with a collapsing sequence of equilibrium states of a shell is computed under different boundary conditions in the quasi-static approximation and compared with black hole entropy. Although explicit expressions involve empirical coefficients, these are constrained by physical conditions of thermodynamical origin. The absence of a Gibbs-Duhem relation and the associated scaling laws for self-gravitating matter systems are presented."

        "Abstract": "Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image domain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these problems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the shape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into difficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example when the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects. Higher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of non-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region topology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary points in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of circular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological, nanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori unknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this report, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee stable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor expansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one of the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In conjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the extraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model outperforms other techniques."

At the time of its discovery in 1998 the source was observed in a low/hard state, showing a hard tail with a high energy cutoff of 70 keV. About two years later the source reappeared about one order of magnitude brighter in the X-rays (0.5-10 keV) and with a significantly steeper spectrum. As was the case for the low state, the data could be fitted by an input model based on two continuum primary components: a) a soft thermal excess, which is ~4 times more luminous than the one found in hard state; b) a non-thermal component which is compatible with either a power-law or a comptonization spectrum. The soft component is equally well described by pure blackbody or multi-color disk emission, with significantly higher temperature than observed in low state (~1.3 vs. the ~0.5 keV assuming pure blackbody). For this model, the flux of the non-thermal component below ~10 keV is a significant fraction of the total X-ray flux, i.e. greater than ~50% in the 2-10 keV band."

        "Title": "Fully Radiative Electroweak Symmetry Breaking",
        "Abstract": "Models of Gauge-Higgs unification in extra dimensions offer a very elegant playground where one can study electroweak symmetry breaking. The nicest feature is that gauge symmetry itself protects the Higgs potential from divergences, thus potentially curing the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model. In a flat space model tree-level contributions to electroweak precision observables will be absent due to the flatness of the gauge and Higgs wave functions. The Higgs potential is fully radiatively generated and the contribution of bulk fermions will induce a vacuum expectation value. A generic problem is that the quartic scalar coupling is too low, resulting in a Higgs VEV that is too close to the compactification scale, and a Higgs mass that is too light. In this paper we show that it is possible to solve these problems in a minimal scenario by cancellations in the Higgs potential between the contribution of different bulk fermions. A crucial role is played by antiperiodic fermions: the cancellation is not the result of a fine tuning, but rather dictated by the choice of representations and parities of the fermions. We also show that introducing a relatively large representation can help in achieving a sufficiently heavy top. In this case, the strong coupling scale is lowered to a marginally acceptable value, and a more careful analysis of two loop effects should decide if the theory remains under perturbative control."

The obtained potential matrix, which subsumes a result obtained in the literature, has a compact analytical form, as well as its Jost matrix. It depends on $N (N+1)/2$ unconstrained parameters and on one upper-bounded parameter, the factorization energy. A detailed study of the model is done for the $2\\times 2$ case: a geometrical analysis of the zeros of the Jost-matrix determinant shows that the model has 0, 1 or 2 bound states, and 0 or 1 resonance; the potential parameters are explicitly expressed in terms of its bound-state energies, of its resonance energy and width, or of the open-channel scattering length, which solves schematic inverse problems. As a first physical application, exactly-solvable $2\\times 2$ atom-atom interaction potentials are constructed, for cases where a magnetic Feshbach resonance interplays with a bound or virtual state close to threshold, which results in a large background scattering length."

Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning techniques are increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance."

We demonstrate that for annealing schedules involving two consecutive diabatic transitions, an interference effect is generated akin to a double-slit experiment. The observation of oscillations in the ground state probability as a function of $t_f$ (before the adiabatic limit sets in) then constitutes a sensitive test of coherence between energy eigenstates. This is further illustrated by analyzing the effect of coupling the TLS to a thermal bath: increasing either the bath temperature or the coupling strength results in a damping of these oscillations. The theoretical tools we introduce significantly simplify the analysis of the generalized Landau-Zener problem. Furthermore, our analysis connects quantum annealing algorithms exhibiting speedups via the mechanism of coherent diabatic transitions to near-term experiments with quantum annealing hardware."

The source faded from an intensity of ~20 mCrab to a minimum of <~0.7 mCrab and then partially recovered towards the end of the observation. This extended minimum lasted ~40,000 seconds. Phase folded light curves at a barycentric rotation period of 124.36568 +/- 0.00020 seconds show that near the center of the extended minimum the source stopped pulsing in the traditional sense but retained a weak dip feature at the rotation period. Away from the extended minimum the dips are progressively narrower at higher energies and may be interpreted as obscurations or eclipses of the hot spot by the accretion column. The pulse profile changed from leading-edge bright before the extended minimum to trailing-edge bright after it. Data from the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) show that a torque reversal occurred <10 days after our observation. Our data indicate that the observed rotation departs from a constant period with a Pdot/P value of ~-1.5% per year at a 4.5 sigma significance. We infer that we may have serendipitously obtained data, with high sensitivity and temporal resolution about the time of an accretion disk spin reversal. We also observed a rapid flare which had some precursor activity, close to the center of the extended minimum."

The underlying perturbation equations govern the Lagrangian displacement of a star in the six-dimensional phase space. This matrix method has a basis in a variational principle. The method is developed in detail for radial oscillations of a spherical system. The basis vectors required for the representation of the Lagrangian displacement in this case are derived from solutions of the Lagrangian perturbation equations for radial perturbations in a homogeneous sphere. The basis vectors are made divergence free in the six-dimensional phase space in accordance with the requirement of Liouville's theorem that the flow of the system in the phase space must be incompressible. The basis vectors are made orthogonal with respect to a properly chosen set of adjoint vectors with the aid of a Gram-Schmidt procedure. Some basis vectors are null vectors in the sense that their inner products with their own adjoint vectors vanish. The characteristic frequencies of the lowest radial modes are calculated in several approximations for members of a family of spherical models which span a wide range of central concentrations. The present formulation of the matrix method can be generalized for nonradial modes in spherical systems and for modes in axisymmetric systems."

Although it is widely accepted that long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, at least two fundamentally different scenarios concerning the final collapse are currently being considered. Delayed reddened excesses in the optical afterglows of several GRBs indicate that a supernova, possibly of Type Ic, takes place within a few days of a GRB. This supports the collapsar model, where the core of a massive star collapses promptly to a black hole. Variable X-ray features observed in the prompt and afterglow spectra of several GRBs, suggest that a highly metal enriched and dense shell of material surrounds the sources of GRBs. In some cases, evidence for expansion of these shells with velocities of a substantial fraction of the speed of light has been claimed. These observations have been interpreted as support for the supranova model, where a massive star collapses first to a supramassive neutron star, which later collapses to a black hole following loss of rotational support. In this review paper, I will present a brief overview of the current status of the observational evidence for X-ray spectral features in GRBs, and discuss their implications for both the collapsar and the supranova model."

To better capture the complex representation of high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG) data, we compute the joint variability of EEG electrodes into a channel cross-covariance matrix. We then extract the spatio-temporal information encoded within the matrix using a mixed deep neural network strategy. Our model framework is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long-short term network (LSTM), and a deep autoencoder. We train the individual networks hierarchically, feeding their combined outputs in a final gradient boosting classification step. Our best models achieve an average accuracy of 77.9% across five different binary classification tasks, providing a significant 22.5% improvement over previous methods. As we also show visually, our work demonstrates that the speech imagery EEG possesses significant discriminative information about the intended articulatory movements responsible for natural speech synthesis."

        "Title": "Ultrafast diffusive cross-sheet motion of lithium through antimonene  with a 2+1 dimensional kinetics",
        "Abstract": "Layered two-dimensional materials like graphene are highly appealing for lithium battery applications owing to their high surface-volume ratios. However, a critical issue that limits their practical applications is the confined motion of lithium atoms within their van der Waal's gaps, which is the leading cause for battery failure due to severe clustering and phase separation. Here we demonstrate that antimonene, an exfoliatable 2D material with a high structural stability, exhibits a highly mobile cross-sheet motion owing to its unique structural features. The advent of the vertically permeable channels opens a new pathway of lithium besides the normal motion along the basal plane, rendering a 2+1 dimensional kinetics. Specifically, our first-principles calculations combined with the discrete geometry analysis revealed that the energy barrier for a lithium atom to diffuse across the antimonene sheet is as low as 0.36 eV, which can be further reduced to 0.18 eV under a tensile strain of 4%. These ultralow diffusion barriers across the sheet can open a new dimension for controlling the motion of lithium atoms, leading to a new paradigm for high-performance lithium batteries or inorganic solid-state lithium-ion conductors."

Being originated from an anomaly - a vacuum contribution -, a non-zero transport coefficient was predicted at zero temperature and chemical potential. In this work we perform a Kubo formula calculation of the thermoelectrical coefficient and confirm that the result agrees with the quantum field theory estimation in the limit of zero temperature and chemical potential. For finite chemical potential {\\mu} around {\\mu} = 0 the transverse Seebeck coefficient shows a plateau indicating that only the zero conformal Landau levels contributes to this intrinsic effect. This result opens the way to the experimental observation of a geometric anomaly which is much harder to explore than the standard chiral anomaly."

        "Abstract": "Using the holographic machinery built up in a previous work, we show that the hidden SL(2,R) symmetry of a scalar quantum field propagating in a Rindler spacetime admits an enlargement in terms of a unitary positive-energy representation of Virasoro algebra, with central charge c=1, defined in the Fock representation. The Virasoro algebra of operators gets a manifest geometrical meaning if referring to the holographically associated QFT on the horizon: It is nothing but a representation of the algebra of vector fields defined on the horizon equipped with a point at infinity. All that happens provided the Virasoro ground energy h vanishes and, in that case, the Rindler Hamiltonian is associated with a certain Virasoro generator. If a suitable regularization procedure is employed, for h=1/2, the ground state of that generator corresponds to thermal states when examined in the Rindler wedge, taking the expectation value with respect to Rindler time. This state has inverse temperature 1/(2beta), where beta is the parameter used to define the initial SL(2,R) unitary representation. (As a consequence the restriction of Minkowski vacuum to Rindler wedge is obtained by fixing h=1/2 and 2beta=beta_U, the latter being Unruh's inverse temperature). Finally, under Wick rotation in Rindler time, the pair of QF theories which are built up on the future and past horizon defines a proper two-dimensional conformal quantum field theory on a cylinder."

In this paper, this 'isothermal approximation' (IA) has been checked and its consequences on the model parameters studied by a comparison with models including central energy equipartition correctly. It is found that, under the IA, the 'temperatures' of a pair of components can differ to a non-negligible amount for low concentration distributions. It is also found that, in general, this approximation leads to a significantly reduced mass segregation in comparison with that given under the exact energy equipartition at the centre. As a representative example, an isotropic 3-component model fitting a given projected surface brightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles is discussed. In this example, the IA gives a cluster envelope much more concentrated (central dimensionless potential W=3.3) than under the true equipartition (W=0.059), as well as a higher logarithmic mass function slope. As a consequence, the inferred total mass (and then the global mass-to-light ratio) results a factor 1.4 times lower than the correct value and the amount of mass in heavy dark remnants is 3.3 times smaller. Under energy equipartition, the fate of stars having a mass below a certain limit is to escape from the system.

        "Title": "Entanglement in phase space",
        "Abstract": "Classical surfaces in phase space correspond to quantum states in Hilbert space. Subsystems specify factor spaces of the Hilbert space. An entangled state corresponds semiclassically to a surface that cannot be decomposed into a product of lower dimensional surfaces. Such a classical factorization never exists for ergodic eigenstates of a chaotic Hamiltonian. The space of quantum operators corresponds to a double phase space. The various representations of the density operator then result from alternative choices of allowed coordinate planes. In the case of the Wigner function and its Fourier transform, the chord function, or the quantum characteristic function, this is a phase space on its own. The reduced Wigner function, representing the partial trace of a density operator over a subsystem is the projection of the original Wigner function; the reduced chord function is obtained as a section. The purity of the reduced density operator, the square of its trace, is a measure of entanglement, obtained by integrating either the square of the reduced Wigner function, or the square-modulus of the reduced chord function. Bell inequalities for general parity measurements can be violated even for classical looking states with positive Wigner functions that have evolved classically from product states. These include the original EPR state. Entanglement with an unknown environment results in decoherence. An example is that of the centre of mass of a large number of independent particles, entangled with internal variables. In this case, the Central Limit Theorem for Wigner functions leads to some aspects of Markovian evolution for the reduced system."

        "Abstract": "Rational design of molecules and materials usually requires extensive screening of molecular structures for the desired property. The inverse approach to deduce a structure for a predefined property would be highly desirable, but is, unfortunately, not well-defined. However, feasible strategies for such an inverse design process may be successfully developed for specific purposes. We discuss options for calculating 'jacket' potentials that fulfill a predefined target requirement - a concept that we recently introduced [T. Weymuth, M. Reiher, MRS Proceediungs, 2013, 1524, DOI:10.1557/opl.2012.1764]. We consider the case of small-molecule activating transition metal catalysts. As a target requirement we choose the vanishing geometry gradients on all atoms of a subsystem consisting of a metal center binding the small molecule to be activated. The jacket potential can be represented within a full quantum model or by a sequence of approximations of which a field of electrostatic point charges is the simplest. In a second step, the jacket potential needs to be replaced by a chemically viable chelate-ligand structure for which the geometry gradients on all of its atoms are also required to vanish. In order to analyze the feasibility of this approach, we dissect a known dinitrogen-fixating catalyst to study possible design strategies that must eventually produce the known catalyst."

        "Abstract": "Noninvasive reconstruction of cardiac electrical activity from surface electrocardiograms (ECG) involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem. Cardiac electrophysiological (EP) models have been used as important a priori knowledge to constrain this inverse problem. However, the reconstruction suffer from inaccuracy and uncertainty of the prior model itself which could be mitigated by estimating a priori model error. Unfortunately, due to the need to handle an additional large number of unknowns in a problem that already suffers from ill-posedness, model error estimation remains an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we address this issue by modeling and estimating the a priori model error in a low dimensional space using a novel sparse prior based on the variational approximation of L0 norm. This prior is used in a posterior regularized Bayesian formulation to quantify the error in a priori EP model during the reconstruction of transmural action potential from ECG data. Through synthetic and real-data experiments, we demonstrate the ability of the presented method to timely capture a priori model error and thus to improve reconstruction accuracy compared to approaches without model error correction."

Unlike previous efforts in the field, that fit only the parameters to the fixed functional forms, we instead use a novel algorithm to search the space of many possible functional forms. While a follow-on practical procedure will use experimental and {\\it ab inito} data to find an optimal functional form for a forcefield, we first validate the approach using a manufactured solution. This validation has the advantage of a well-defined metric of success. We manufactured a training set of atomic coordinate data with an associated set of global energies using the well-known Lennard-Jones inter-atomic potential. We performed an automatic functional form fitting procedure starting with a population of random functions, using a genetic programming functional formulation, and a parallel tempering Metropolis-based optimization algorithm. Our massively-parallel method independently discovered the Lennard-Jones function after searching for several hours on 100 processors and covering a miniscule portion of the configuration space. We find that the method is suitable for unsupervised discovery of functional forms for inter-atomic potentials/force-fields. We also find that our parallel tempering Metropolis-based approach significantly improves the optimization convergence time, and takes good advantage of the parallel cluster architecture."

        "Abstract": "This paper is concerned with the weak-moment magnetism in heavy-fermion materials and its relation to the non-Fermi liquid physics observed near the transition to the Fermi liquid. We explore the hypothesis that the primary fluctuations responsible for the non-Fermi liquid physics are those associated with the destruction of the large Fermi surface of the Fermi liquid. Magnetism is suggested to be a low-energy instability of the resulting small Fermi surface state. A concrete realization of this picture is provided by a fractionalized Fermi liquid state which has a small Fermi surface of conduction electrons, but also has other exotic excitations with interactions described by a gauge theory in its deconfined phase. Of particular interest is a three-dimensional fractionalized Fermi liquid with a spinon Fermi surface and a U(1) gauge structure. A direct second-order transition from this state to the conventional Fermi liquid is possible and involves a jump in the electron Fermi surface volume. The critical point displays non-Fermi liquid behavior. A magnetic phase may develop from a spin density wave instability of the spinon Fermi surface. This exotic magnetic metal may have a weak ordered moment although the local moments do not participate in the Fermi surface. Experimental signatures of this phase and implications for heavy-fermion systems are discussed."

The concept is based on a combined high-current lens/target configuration. Current is fed at an electrode located downstream from the beginning of the target where pion capturing is needed. The current is carried by plasma outside the target. A second plasma lens section, with an additional current feed, follows the target. The plasma is immersed in a relatively small solenoidal magnetic field to facilitate its current profile shaping to optimize pion capture. Simulations of the not yet fully optimized configuration yielded a 25% higher neutrino flux at a detector situated at 3 km from the target than the horn system for the entire energy spectrum and a factor of 2.5 higher flux for neutrinos with energy larger than 3 GeV. A major advantage of plasma lenses is in background reduction. In antineutrino operation, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of close to 3 for the whole spectrum, and for energy larger than 3 GeV, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of 3.6. Plasma lenses have additional advantages: larger axial currents, high signal purity: minimal neutrino background in antineutrino runs. The lens medium consists of plasma, consequently, particle absorption and scattering is negligible. Withstanding high mechanical and thermal stresses in a plasma is not an issue."

At the TeV scale there are additional scalars, gauge bosons, and vector-like charge 2/3 quarks, whose couplings to the Higgs greatly reduce the UV sensitivity of the Higgs potential. Stabilization of the Higgs mass squared parameter, without finetuning, occurs due to a softly broken shift symmetry--the Higgs is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. Above the 10 TeV scale the theory has new strongly coupled interactions. A perturbatively renormalizable UV completion, with softly broken supersymmetry at 10 TeV is explicitly worked out. Our theory contains new particles which are odd under an exact \"dark matter parity\", (-1)^{(2S+3B+L)}. We argue that such a parity is likely to be a feature of many theories of new TeV scale physics. The lightest parity odd particle, or \"LPOP\", is most likely a neutral fermion, and may make a good dark matter candidate, with similar experimental signatures to the neutralino of the MSSM. We give a general effective field theory analysis of the calculation of corrections to precision electroweak observables."

We calculate exactly the covariance function of the running range and analyse its asymptotic behaviour. Our analysis reveals non-trivial correlations between the value of the largest descent (rise) of a BM from the top to a bottom on some time interval, and the value of this property on a larger time interval."

Our starting point is a recently published parameter space, a point in which defines a family of binary texture images displaying a prescribed content of \\nth{1}- to \\nth{4}-order correlations among pixels in 2x2 patches. We show that this parameter space can be represented by fewer variables, namely the \\emph{orbit invariants} obtained by exploiting texture symmetry. Next we show how a class of locally countable texture statistics, the Minkowski functionals -- recently shown to be a proxy for human performance in texture discrimination tasks - can be written as a linear combination of the dihedral orbit invariants. Furthermore, by recasting these functionals as a combination of dihedral invariants, a generalization of these functionals can be obtained for textures of any number of grey-levels, patch sizes, or lattice types -- greatly reducing the number of dimensions/parameters needed to characterize the generated images. Orbit invariants may therefore provide a clue on the discrimination of these richer textures, as the ordinary Minkowski functionals do for binary textures."

Merger simulations are carried out using N-body algorithms that can follow the formation and decay of a black-hole binary and its effect on the surrounding stars down to sub-parsec scales. Our initial stellar systems have steep central density cusps similar to those in low-luminosity elliptical galaxies. Formation of a black-hole binary transfers energy to the stars and lowers the central density; continued decay of the binary creates a ~1/r density cusp similar to those observed in bright elliptical galaxies, with a break radius that extends well beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the black holes. The decay of the black hole binary is followed over a factor of ~20 in separation after formation of a hard binary, considerably farther than in previous simulations. We see almost no dependence of the binary's decay rate on number of particles in the simulation, contrary to earlier studies in which a lower initial density of stars led to a more rapid depletion of the binary's loss cone. We nevertheless argue that the decay of a black hole binary in a real galaxy would be expected to stall at separations of 0.01-1 pc unless some additional mechanism is able to extract energy from the binary. Our results support a picture in which the observed dependence of nuclear cusp slope on galaxy luminosity is a consequence of galaxy interactions. We also discuss the implications of our results for the survivability of dark-matter cusps."

The Darwin Lagrangian is used to analyze the electromagnetic behavior of the model magnetic moment (composed of two oppositely charged particles of different mass in an initially circular orbit) interacting with a passing point charge. The changing mangetic moment is found to put a force back on a passing charge; this force is of order 1/c^2 and depends upon the magnitude of the magnetic moment. It is suggested that in the limit of a multiparticle magnetic toroid, the electric fields of the passing charge are screened out of the body of the magnet while the magnetic fields penetrate into the magnet. This is consistent with our understanding of the penetration of electromagnetic velocity fields into ohmic conductors. Conservation laws are discussed. The work corresponds to a classical electromagnetic analysis of the interaction which is basic to understanding the controversy over the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts and represents a refutation of the suggestions of Aharonov, Pearle, and Vaidman."

To shed light on the interactions between stem and non-stem cancer cell populations we develop a two-population mathematical model, which is suitable to describe tumorsphere growth. Both interspecific and intraspecific interactions, mediated by the microenvironment, are included. We show that there is a tipping point, characterized by a transcritical bifurcation, where a purely non-stem cell attractor is replaced by a new attractor that contains both stem and differentiated cancer cells. The model is then applied to describe the outcome of a recent experiment. This description reveals that, while the intraspecific interactions are inhibitory, the interspecific interactions stimulate growth. This can be understood in terms of stem cells needing differentiated cells to reinforce their niches, and phenotypic plasticity favoring the de-differentiation of differentiated cells into cancer stem cells. We posit that this is a consequence of the deregulation of the quorum sensing that maintains homeostasis in healthy tissues."

A parameterization of a generalized dark energy is developed with the extension of fluid perturbation theory to models which cross through an equation of state of -1. This parameterization is selected to be general enough to admit a wide variety of behavior, while still being physical and economical. A Fisher matrix analysis with future high-precision CMB, cluster survey, and SNIa data suggests the parameters will probably be resolvable in the foreseeable future. How accurately the parameters can be determined depends sensitively on the nature of the dark energy - particularly how significant of a fraction of the total energy density it has been in the past. Parameter space will be sampled at a large number of points, with cosmological information such as CMB, power spectra, etc of each point being archived. Thus the likelihood functions of an arbitrary set of experiments can be applied to parameter space with insignificant new computational cost, making a wide variety of analyses possible. The resulting tool for Analysis and Resolution of Dark-sector Attributes, ARDA, will be highly versatile and adaptable. ARDA will allow the scientific community to extract parameters with an arbitrary set of experiments and theoretical priors, test for tension between classes of observations and investigate the effectiveness of hypothetical experiments, while evolving in a data-driven manner.

The coherent average method then is proposed to construct the state-selective trigger pulse. A state-selective trigger pulse can keep Gaussian shape unchanged but change in an internal-state-dependent form the center-of-mass position and/or momentum of an atomic Gaussian wave-packet motional state. A Gaussian wave-packet state is one of the simplest wave-packet states that can be easily manipulated and controlled in time and space. The paper also investigates how to manipulate in time and space an atomic Gaussian wave-packet motional state by a generalized quadratic potential field. A general quadratic Hamiltonian can affect not only the center-of-mass position and momentum but also the complex linewidth of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state while keep Gaussian shape of the motional state unchanged. It is shown that generally quadratic terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can control directly the complex linewidth, while linear terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can affect only the center-of-mass position and momentum of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state."

(2000). The 3-sigma random noise level of our analysis is 0.00006 stellar continuum flux units, and the confusion noise limit - measuring the resemblence of a cross-correlation feature to the spectrum of methane - is 0.00025.   We find a significant cross-correlation amplitude of 0.00033 continuum units at a velocity near that of the star. This is likely due to methane from a low-mass companion in a long-period orbit. Fischer, Butler and Marcy (2000) report a long-term velocity drift indicative of such a companion. But the system is known to be a visual binary with an eccentric orbit, and is rapidly approaching periastron. Whether the visual companion can account for our observations and the Fischer et al. velocity drift depends on knowing the orbit more precisely. The stability of planetary orbits in this system also depends crucially on the properties of the binary orbit. A second cross-correlation feature, weaker and much more diffuse, has intensity amplitude 0.0002 continuum units and occurs at a velocity amplitude of 71 +/-10 km/sec, in agreement with the orbit claimed for the planet by Cameron et al.

We demonstrate that for annealing schedules involving two consecutive diabatic transitions, an interference effect is generated akin to a double-slit experiment. The observation of oscillations in the ground state probability as a function of $t_f$ (before the adiabatic limit sets in) then constitutes a sensitive test of coherence between energy eigenstates. This is further illustrated by analyzing the effect of coupling the TLS to a thermal bath: increasing either the bath temperature or the coupling strength results in a damping of these oscillations. The theoretical tools we introduce significantly simplify the analysis of the generalized Landau-Zener problem. Furthermore, our analysis connects quantum annealing algorithms exhibiting speedups via the mechanism of coherent diabatic transitions to near-term experiments with quantum annealing hardware."

        "Title": "Experts' understanding of partial derivatives using the Partial  Derivative Machine",
        "Abstract": "Partial derivatives are used in a variety of different ways within physics. Most notably, thermodynamics uses partial derivatives in ways that students often find confusing. As part of a collaboration with mathematics faculty, we are at the beginning of a study of the teaching of partial derivatives, a goal of better aligning the teaching of multivariable calculus with the needs of students in STEM disciplines. As a part of this project, we have performed a pilot study of expert understanding of partial derivatives across three disciplines: physics, engineering and mathematics. Our interviews made use of the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM), which is a mechanical system featuring four observable and controllable properties, of which any two are independent. Using the PDM, we probed expert understanding of partial derivatives in an experimental context in which there is not a known functional form. Through these three interviews, we found that the mathematicians exhibited a striking difference in their understanding of derivatives relative to the other groups. The physicists and engineers were quick to use measurements to find a numeric approximation for a derivative. In contrast, the mathematicians repeatedly returned to speculation as to the functional form, and although they were comfortable drawing qualitative conclusions about the system from measurements, were reluctant to approximate the derivative through measurement. This pilot study led us to further questions. How do fields differ in their experts' concept image of partial derivatives? What representations of partial derivatives are preferred by experts? We plan to address these questions by means of further interviews with a wider range of disciplinary experts."

        "Abstract": "We consider a crowdsourcing data acquisition scenario, such as federated learning, where a Center collects data points from a set of rational Agents, with the aim of training a model. For linear regression models, we show how a payment structure can be designed to incentivize the agents to provide high-quality data as early as possible, based on a characterization of the influence that data points have on the loss function of the model. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (a) we prove theoretically that this scheme ensures truthful data reporting as a game-theoretic equilibrium and further demonstrate its robustness against mixtures of truthful and heuristic data reports, (b) we design a procedure according to which the influence computation can be efficiently approximated and processed sequentially in batches over time, (c) we develop a theory that allows correcting the difference between the influence and the overall change in loss and (d) we evaluate our approach on real datasets, confirming our theoretical findings."

        "Title": "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Advantage-Weighted Information  Maximization",
        "Abstract": "Real-world tasks are often highly structured. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has attracted research interest as an approach for leveraging the hierarchical structure of a given task in reinforcement learning (RL). However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that enhances the performance of RL is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an HRL method that learns a latent variable of a hierarchical policy using mutual information maximization. Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling. In our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy. Experimental results indicate that our HRL approach can learn a diversity of options and that it can enhance the performance of RL in continuous control tasks."

        "Abstract": "Motivated by recent experimental results for the step sizes of dynein motor proteins, we develope a cellular automata model for intra-cellular traffic of dynein motors incorporating special features of the hindrance-dependent step size of the individual motors. We begin by investigating the properties of the aggressive driving model (ADM), a simple cellular automata-based model of vehicular traffic, a unique feature of which is that it allows a natural extension to capture the essential features of dynein motor traffic. We first calculate several collective properties of the ADM, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, analytically using two different mean-field approaches as well as by carrying out computer simulations. Then we extend the ADM by incorporating the possibilities of attachment and detachment of motors on the track which is a common feature of a large class of motor proteins that are collectively referred to as cytoskeletal motors. The interplay of the boundary and bulk dynamics of attachment and detachment of the motors to the track gives rise a phase where high and low density phases separated by a stable domain wall coexist. We also compare and contrast our results with the model of Parmeggiani et. al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 90}, 086601 (2003)) which can be regarded as a minimal model for traffic of a closely related family of motor proteins called kinesin. Finally, we compare the transportation efficiencies of dynein and kinesin motors over a range of values of the model parameters."

        "Abstract": "We propose a two-layer coding architecture for communication of multiple users over a shared slotted medium enabling joint collision resolution and decoding. Each user first encodes its information bits with an outer code for reliability, and then transmits these coded bits with possible repetitions over transmission time slots of the access channel. The transmission patterns are dictated by the inner collision-resolution code and collisions with other users' transmissions may occur. We analyze two types of codes for the outer layer: long-blocklength LDPC codes, and short-blocklength algebraic codes. With LDPC codes, a density evolution analysis enables joint optimization of both outer and inner code parameters for maximum throughput. With algebraic codes, we invoke a similar analysis by approximating their average erasure correcting capability while assuming a large number of active transmitters. The proposed low-complexity schemes operate at a significantly smaller gap to capacity than the state of the art. Our schemes apply both to a multiple access scenario where number of users within a frame is known a priori, and to a random access scenario where that number is known only to the decoder. In the latter case, we optimize an outage probability due to the variability in user activity."

The high energy spectrum exhibits such a high column density that the source is undetectable in X-rays below 2 keV. We used the NTT telescope of ESO to obtain optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations. We confirm the already proposed NIR counterpart and for the first time extended detection into optical. We report here photometric measurements in the R, I, J, bands, upper flux limits in the Bb and V bands, lower flux limits in the H and Ks bands. We also obtain NIR spectroscopy, revealing a large number of emission lines, including forbidden iron lines and P-Cygni profiles, and showing a strong similarity with CI Cam, another strongly absorbed source. These data point to a high luminosity, high temperature source, with an intrinsic optical-NIR absorption greater than the interstellar absorption, but two orders of magnitude below the X-ray absorption. We propose that the source is a High Mass X-ray binary (HMXB) at a distance between 0.9 and 6.2 kpc, the optical/NIR counterpart corresponds to the mass donor, which is an early-type star, maybe a sgB[e] star, surrounded by a dense and absorbing circumstellar material. This would make the second HMXB with a sgB[e] star as the mass donor after CI Cam. Such sources may represent a different evolutionary state of X-ray binaries previously undetected with the lower energy space telescopes ; if it is so, a new class of strongly absorbed X-ray binaries is being unveiled by INTEGRAL."

On a square symmetry lattice made of three (economic) regions, firms, described by a scalar fitness, are allowed to move, adapt, merge or create spin-offs under predetermined rules, in a space and time dependent economic environment. We only consider here one timely variation of the ''external economic field condition''. For the firm fitness evolution we take into account a constraint such that the disappearance of a firm modifies the fitness of nearest neighboring ones, as in Bak-Sneppen population fitness evolution model. The concentration of firms, the averaged fitness, the regional distribution of firms, and fitness for different time moments, the number of collapsed, merged and new firms as a function of time have been recorded and are discussed. Also the asymptotic values of the number of firms present in the three regions together with their average fitness, as well as the number of respective births and collapses in the three regions are examined. It appears that a sort of $critical$ selection pressure exists. A power law dependence, signature of self-critical organization is seen in the birth and collapse asymptotic values for a high selection pressure only. A lack of self-organization is also seen at region borders."

        "Abstract": "Held has proposed a coordinate- and gauge-free integration procedure within the GHP formalism built around four functionally independent zero-weighted scalars constructed from the spin coefficients and the Riemann tensor components. Unfortunately, a spacetime with Killing vectors will be unable to supply the full quota of four scalars of this type. However, for such a spacetime additional scalars are supplied by the components of the Killing vectors; by using these alongside the spin coefficients and the Riemann tensor components we have the possibility of constructing the full quota of four functionally independent zero-weighted scalars, and of exploiting Held's procedure.   As an illustration we investigate the vacuum Type N spaces admitting a Killing vector and a homothetic Killing vector. In a direct manner, we reduce the problem to a pair of ordinary differential operator `master equations', making use of a new zero-weighted GHP operator. By first rewriting the master equations as a closed set of complex first order equations, we reduce the problem to one real third order operator differential equation for a complex function of a real variable --- but with still the freedom to choose explicitly our fourth coordinate. An alternative, more algorithmic approach, using a closed chain of real first order equations for real functions, reduces the problem to the same order, but in a more natural and much more concise form. It is also outlined how the various other third order differential equations, which have been derived previously by other workers on this problem, can be deduced from our master equations."

        "Abstract": "While it is well-known that \"biased galaxy formation\" can increase the strength of galaxy clustering, it is less clear whether straightforward biasing schemes can change the shape of the galaxy correlation function on large scales. Here we consider \"local\" biasing models, in which the galaxy density field $\\delta_g$ at a point is a function of the matter density field $\\delta$ at that point: $\\delta_g = f(\\delta)$. We consider both deterministic biasing, where $f$ is simply a function, and stochastic biasing, in which the galaxy density is a random variable whose distribution depends on the matter density: $\\delta_g=X(\\delta)$. We show that even when this mapping is performed on a highly nonlinear density field with a hierarchical correlation structure, the correlation function $\\xi$ is simply scaled up by a constant, as long as $\\xi << 1$. In stochastic biasing models, the galaxy autocorrelation function behaves exactly as in deterministic models, with the mean value of $X$ for a given value of $\\delta$ taking the role of the deterministic bias function. We extend our results to the power spectrum P(k), showing that for sufficiently small k, the effect of local biasing is equivalent to the multiplication of P(k) by a constant, with the addition of a constant term. If a cosmological model predicts a large-scale mass correlation function in conflict with the shape of the observed galaxy correlation function, then the model cannot be rescued by appealing to a complicated but local relation between galaxies and mass."

        "Abstract": "Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image domain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these problems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the shape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into difficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example when the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects. Higher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of non-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region topology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary points in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of circular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological, nanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori unknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this report, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee stable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor expansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one of the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In conjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the extraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model outperforms other techniques."

        "Abstract": "We present a deep X-ray observation of the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in NGC4258 (M106) using ASCA. The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

This is the first clear example of a shock front in a cluster. From the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock, the Mach number of the bullet-like cloud is 2-3. This corresponds to a velocity of 3000-4000 km/s relative to the main cluster, which means that the cloud traversed the core just 0.1-0.2 Gyr ago. The 6-7 keV \"bullet\" appears to be a remnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a merging subcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure. The bullet's shape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by ram pressure and gas dynamic instabilities, as the subcluster galaxies move well ahead of the cool gas. The unique simplicity of the shock front and bullet geometry in 1E0657-56 may allow a number of interesting future measurements. The cluster's average temperature is 14-15 keV but shows large spatial variations. The hottest gas (T>20 keV) lies in the region of the radio halo enhancement and extensive merging activity involving subclusters other than the bullet."

SAT analogy questions provide a word pair, A:B, and the problem is to select the most analogous word pair, C:D, from a set of five choices. The VSM algorithm correctly answers 47% of a collection of 374 college-level analogy questions (random guessing would yield 20% correct).

The problem is to classify a noun-modifier pair, such as \"laser printer\", according to the semantic relation between the noun (printer) and the modifier (laser). We use a supervised nearest-neighbour algorithm that assigns a class to a given noun-modifier pair by finding the most analogous noun-modifier pair in the training data. With 30 classes of semantic relations, on a collection of 600 labeled noun-modifier pairs, the learning algorithm attains an F value of 26.5% (random guessing: 3.3%).

The model mimics a nanoporous environment, where each nanotube or unit cell is represented by a one-dimensional array. Two kinds of lateral interaction energies have been considered: $1)$ $w_L$, interaction energy between nearest-neighbor particles adsorbed along a single channel and $2)$ $w_T$, interaction energy between particles adsorbed across nearest-neighbor channels. For $w_L/w_T=0$ and $w_T > 0$, successive planes are uncorrelated, the system is equivalent to the triangular lattice and the well-known $(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})$ $[(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})^*]$ ordered phase is found at low temperatures and a coverage, $\\theta$, of 1/3 $[2/3]$. In the more general case ($w_L/w_T \\neq 0$ and $w_T > 0$), a competition between interactions along a single channel and a transverse coupling between sites in neighboring channels allows to evolve to a three-dimensional adsorbed layer. Consequently, the $(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})$ and $(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})^*$ structures \"propagate\" along the channels and new ordered phases appear in the adlayer. The Monte Carlo technique was combined with the recently reported Free Energy Minimization Criterion Approach (FEMCA), to predict the critical temperatures of the order-disorder transformation.

However, a fast convergence to the optimal solution can only be ensured with the use of problem-specific sampling distributions. Due to the large variety of driving situations within the context of automated driving, it is very challenging to manually design such distributions. This paper introduces therefore a data-driven approach utilizing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN): Given the current driving situation, future ego-vehicle poses can be directly generated from the output of the CNN allowing to guide the motion planner efficiently towards the optimal solution. A benchmark highlights that the CNN predicts future vehicle poses with a higher accuracy compared to uniform sampling and a state-of-the-art A*-based approach. Combining this CNN-guided sampling with the motion planner Bidirectional RRT* reduces the computation time by up to an order of magnitude and yields a faster convergence to a lower cost as well as a success rate of 100 % in the tested scenarios."

Less known is the fact that a black hole can be produced by the quantum process of pair creation in external fields.

This pair creation process can be investigated semiclassically using non-perturbative instanton methods, thus it may be used as a theoretical laboratory to obtain clues for a quantum gravity theory. In this work, we review briefly the history of pair creation of particles and black holes in external fields. In order to present some features of the euclidean instanton method which is used to calculate pair creation rates, we study a simple model of a scalar field and propose an effective one-loop action for a two-dimensional soliton pair creation problem. This action is built from the soliton field itself and the soliton charge is no longer treated as a topological charge but as a Noether charge. The results are also valid straightforwardly to the problem of pair creation rate of domain walls in dimensions greater than 2."

In particular, they are used to obtain a canonical Hom-Lie bialgebra structure on the double space of a Hom-Lie bialgebra. We also derive solutions of the classical Hom-Yang-Baxter equation from $\\mathcal{O}$-operators and Hom-left-symmetric algebras."

        "Title": "Mass-Generation by Weyl-Symmetry Breaking",
        "Abstract": "A massless electroweak theory for leptons is formulated in a Weyl space, W_4, yielding a Weyl invariant gauge dynamics allowing for conformal rescalings of the metric and all fields with nonvanishing Weyl weight together with the corresponding transformations of the Weyl vector fields representing the D(1) or dilatation gauge fields. To study the appearance of nonzero masses this theory is explicitly broken by a term in the Lagrangean involving the curvature scalar R of the W_4 and a mass term for the scalar field. Thereby also the gauge fields as well as the charged fermion field acquire a mass as in the standard electroweak theory. The symmetry breaking is governed by the relation D Phi^2=0, where Phi is the modulus of the scalar field and D denotes the Weyl-covariant derivative. This true symmetry reduction, establishing a scale of length in the theory, is compared to the so-called spontanous symmetry breaking in the standard electroweak theory which is, actually, the choice of a particular (nonlinear) gauge obtained by adopting an origin in the coset space representing the scalar field which is invariant under the electromagnetic gauge group. Particular attention is devoted to the appearance of Einstein's equations for the metric after the Weyl-symmetry breaking yielding a pseudo-Riemannian space V_4 from a W_4 and a scalar field with a constant modulus which in turn affects Einstein's gravitational constant in a manner comparable to the Brans-Dicke theory."

        "Abstract": "In practice, histopathological diagnosis of tumor malignancy often requires a human expert to scan through histopathological images at multiple magnification levels, after which a final diagnosis can be accurately determined. However, previous research on such classification tasks using convolutional neural networks primarily determine a diagnosis for a single magnification level. In this paper, we propose a case-based approach using deep residual neural networks for histopathological malignancy diagnosis, where a case is defined as a sequence of images from the patient at all available levels of magnification. Effectively, through mimicking what a human expert would actually do, our approach makes a diagnosis decision based on features learned in combination at multiple magnification levels. Our results show that the case-based approach achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on BreaKHis, a histopathological image dataset for breast tumors."

        "Abstract": "We show that a system consisting of two interacting particles with unequal masses in a hard-wall box can be exactly solved by using Bethe ansatz, when the mass ratio takes some specific values. The ansatz is based on finite superpositions of plane waves associated with a dihedral group $D_{2n}$, which enforces the momentums after a series of scattering and reflection processes to fulfill the $D_{2n}$ symmetry. Starting from a two-body elastic collision model in a hard-wall box, we demonstrate how a finite momentum distribution is related to the $D_{2n}$ symmetry and gives the condition of permitted mass ratios corresponding to classical superintegrable points. For a quantum system with mass ratio $3$, we obtain exact eigenenergies and eigenstates by solving Bethe ansatz equations for arbitrary interaction strength. A many-body excited state of the system is found to be independent of the interaction strength, i.e. the wave function looks exactly the same for non-interacting two particles or in the hard-core limit."

It is a theory of parity for a large class of virtual links, defined using the interaction between orientations of the link components and a certain type of colouring. The 2-colour parity is an extension of the Gaussian parity, to which it reduces on virtual knots. We show that the 2-colour parity descends to a parity on free links. We compare the 2-colour parity to other parity theories of virtual links, focusing on a theory due to Im and Park. The 2-colour parity yields a strictly stronger invariant than the Im-Park parity. We introduce an invariant, the 2-colour writhe, that takes the form of a string of integers. The 2-colour writhe is a concordance invariant, and so obstructs sliceness. It is also an obstruction to amphichirality and chequerboard colourability within a concordance class."

The focus of this work is to develop, analyze, implement and compare local patrolling policies. We desire strategies that achieve full coverage, but also produce good coverage frequency and visitation times. Policies that provide theoretical guarantees for these quantities have received some attention, but gaps have remained. We present: 1) A summary of how to achieve coverage by building a triangulation of the workspace, and the ensuing properties. 2) A description of simple local policies (LRV, for Least Recently Visited and LFV, for Least Frequently Visited) for achieving coverage by the patrolling robots. 3) New analytical arguments why different versions of LRV may require worst case exponential time between visits of triangles. 4) Analytical evidence that a local implementation of LFV on the edges of the dual graph is possible in our scenario, and immensely better in the worst case. 5) Experimental and simulation validation for the practical usefulness of these policies, showing that even a small number of weak robots with weak local information can greatly outperform a single, powerful robots with full information and computational capabilities."

        "Abstract": "A set of equations describing the motion of a free magnetic nanoparticle in an external magnetic field in a vacuum, or in a medium with negligibly small friction forces is postulated. The conservation of the total particle momentum, i.e. the sum of the mechanical and the total spin momentum of the nanoparticle is taken into account explicitly. It is shown that for the motion of a nanoparticle in uniform magnetic field there are three different modes of precession of the unit magnetization vector and the director that is parallel the particle easy anisotropy axis. These modes differ significantly in the precession frequency. For the high-frequency mode the director points approximately along the external magnetic field, whereas the frequency and the characteristic relaxation time of the precession of the unit magnetization vector are close to the corresponding values for conventional ferromagnetic resonance. On the other hand, for the low-frequency modes the unit magnetization vector and the director are nearly parallel and rotate in unison around the external magnetic field. The characteristic relaxation time for the low-frequency modes is remarkably long. This means that in a rare assembly of magnetic nanoparticles there is a possibility of additional resonant absorption of the energy of alternating magnetic field at a frequency that is much smaller compared to conventional ferromagnetic resonance frequency. The scattering of a beam of magnetic nanoparticles in a vacuum in a non-uniform external magnetic field is also considered taking into account the precession of the unit magnetization vector and director."

In this paper, we exploit this fact to reduce the disparate impact of a fixed classification model over a population of interest. Given a black-box classifier, we aim to eliminate the performance gap by perturbing the distribution of input variables for the disadvantaged group. We refer to the perturbed distribution as a counterfactual distribution, and characterize its properties for common fairness criteria. We introduce a descent algorithm to learn a counterfactual distribution from data. We then discuss how the estimated distribution can be used to build a data preprocessor that can reduce disparate impact without training a new model. We validate our approach through experiments on real-world datasets, showing that it can repair different forms of disparity without a significant drop in accuracy."

In this context, the next generation of radio telescopes, like the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), with their unprecedented sensitivity, will play a key role. In this paper, we investigate the capability of future radio telescopes to probe the spacetime of a black hole and test gravity theories, by timing a pulsar orbiting a stellar-mass-black-hole (SBH). Based on mock data simulations, we show that a few years of timing observations of a sufficiently compact pulsar-SBH (PSR-SBH) system with future radio telescopes would allow precise measurements of the black hole mass and spin. A measurement precision of one per cent can be expected for the spin. Measuring the quadrupole moment of the black hole, needed to test GR's no-hair theorem, requires extreme system configurations with compact orbits and a large SBH mass. Additionally, we show that a PSR-SBH system can lead to greatly improved constraints on alternative gravity theories even if they predict black holes (practically) identical to GR's. This is demonstrated for a specific class of scalar-tensor theories. Finally, we investigate the requirements for searching for PSR-SBH systems. It is shown that the high sensitivity of the next generation of radio telescopes is key for discovering compact PSR-SBH systems, as it will allow for sufficiently short survey integration times."

For this application, previous results are restricted to initial histories belonging to the so-called solution manifold. We here generalize the results to a set of nonnegative Lipschitz initial histories which is much larger than the solution manifold and moreover convex. Additionally, we show that the solutions define a semiflow that is continuous in the state-component in the $C([-h,0],\\R^2)$ topology, which is a variant of established differentiability of the semiflow in $C^1([-h,0],\\R^2)$.

We propose a probabilistic rational temporal logic PRTL*, which extends the probabilistic computation tree logic PCTL* with reasoning about mental attitudes (beliefs, goals and intentions), and includes novel operators that can express concepts of social trust such as competence, disposition and dependence. The logic can express, for example, that `agent A will eventually trust agent B with probability at least p that B will behave in a way that ensures the successful completion of a given task'. We study the complexity of the automated verification problem and, while the general problem is undecidable, we identify restrictions on the logic and the system that result in decidable, or even tractable, subproblems."

Fluctuations of isospin charge are considered in a thermal system at rest as well as in a moving hadronic fluid at fixed proper time within a finite bin of pseudo-rapidity. In the former case, we use general thermodynamic relations to establish a connection between fluctuations and the space-like screening limit of the retarded photon self-energy, which directly relates to the emissivities of dileptons and photons. Effects of hadronic interactions are highlighted through two illustrative calculations. In the latter case, we show that a finite time scale $\\tau$ inherent in the evolution of a heavy-ion collision implies that equilibrium fluctuations involve both space-like and time-like components of the photon self-energy in the system. Our study of non-thermal effects, explored here through a stochastic treatment, shows that an early and large fluctuation in isospin survives only if it is accompanied by a large temperature fluctuation at freeze-out, an unlikely scenario in hadronic phases with large heat capacity. We point out prospects for the future which include: (1) A determination of the Debye mass of the system at the dilute freeze-out stage of a heavy-ion collision, and (2) A delineation of the role of charge fluctuations during the dense stages of the collision through a study of electromagnetic emissivities."

For statistics related to count-in-cells, such as factorial moments, F_k, the average correlation function, xiav, and cumulants, S_N, the functions Upsilon(VF_k), Upsilon(Vxiav), and Upsilon(VS_N) were measured in a large tauCDM simulation. This N-body experiment simulates almost the full ``Hubble Volume'' of the universe, thus, for the first time, it allowed for an accurate analysis of the cosmic distribution function, and, in particular, of its variance (Delta A)^2, the cosmic error. The resulting detailed knowledge about the shape of Upsilon is crucial for likelihood analyses. The measured cosmic error agrees remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of Szapudi & Colombi (1996) and Szapudi, Bernardeau & Colombi (1998) in the weakly non-linear regime, while the predictions are slightly above the measurements in the highly nonlinear regime. When the relative cosmic error is small, (Delta A/A)^2, function Upsilon is nearly Gaussian. When (Delta A/A)^2 approaches unity or is larger, function Upsilon(VA) is increasingly skewed and well approximated by a lognormal distribution for A=F_k, or A=xiav. The measured cumulants follow accurately the perturbation theory predictions in the weakly nonlinear regime. Extended perturbation theory is an excellent approximation for all the available dynamic range."

A key feature of the LXePET system is the ability to identify individual photon interactions with high energy resolution and high spatial resolution in 3 dimensions and determine the correct interaction sequence using Compton reconstruction algorithms. The simulated LXePET imaging performance was evaluated by computing the noise equivalent count rate, the sensitivity and point spread function for a point source, and by examining the image quality using a micro-Derenzo phantom according to the NEMA-NU4 standard. Results of these simulation studies included NECR peaking at 1326 kcps at 188 MBq (705 kcps at 184 MBq) for an energy window of 450 - 600 keV and a coincidence window of 1 ns for mouse (rat) phantoms.

Radial, tangential, and axial resolutions of 22Na point sources reconstructed with a list-mode maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm were <= 0.8 mm (FWHM) throughout the field of view.

It is shown that if the initial data for an expanding cosmological model of this type is subjected to a small perturbation then the corresponding solution exists globally in the future and the perturbation decays in a way which can be described precisely. It is emphasized that no linearization of the equations or special symmetry assumptions are needed. The result can also be interpreted as a proof of the nonlinear stability of the homogeneous models. In order to prove the theorem we write the general solution as the sum of a homogeneous background and a perturbation. As a by-product of the analysis it is found that there is an invariant sense in which an inhomogeneous model can be regarded as a perturbation of a unique homogeneous model. A method is given for associating uniquely to each Newtonian cosmological model with compact spatial sections a spatially homogeneous model which incorporates its large-scale dynamics. This procedure appears very natural in the Newton-Cartan theory which we take as the starting point for Newtonian cosmology."

The phase modulation is achieved by sending two light pulses with a fixed time delay (or a fixed optical path delay) through a frequency shift element and by modulating the amount of frequency shift. The relative phase between two light pulses upon leaving the frequency-shift element is determined by both the time delay (or the optical path delay) and the frequency shift, and can therefore be controlled by varying the amount of frequency shift. To demonstrate its operation, we used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) as the frequency-shift element, and vary the driving frequency of the AOM to encode phase information.The interference visibility for a 40km and a 10km fiber loop is 96% and 99%, respectively, at single photon level. We ran BB84 protocol in a 40-km Sagnac loop setup continuously for one hour and the measured QBER remained within the 2%~5% range. A further advantage of our scheme is that both phase and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously by frequency and amplitude modulation of the AOM's driving signal, allowing our QKD system the capability of implementing other protocols, such as the decoy-state QKD and the continuous- variable QKD. We also briefly discuss a new type of Eavesdropping strategy (\"phaseremapping\" attack) in bidirectional QKD system."

        "Abstract": "Management of the portfolios containing low liquidity assets is a tedious problem. The buyer proposes the price that can differ greatly from the paper value estimated by the seller, the seller, on the other hand, can not liquidate his portfolio instantly and waits for a more favorable offer. To minimize losses in this case we need to develop new methods. One of the steps moving the theory towards practical needs is to take into account the time lag of the liquidation of an illiquid asset. This task became especially significant for the practitioners in the time of the global financial crises. Working in the Merton's optimal consumption framework with continuous time we consider an optimization problem for a portfolio with an illiquid, a risky and a risk-free asset. While a standard Black-Scholes market describes the liquid part of the investment the illiquid asset is sold at a random moment with prescribed liquidation time distribution. In the moment of liquidation it generates additional liquid wealth dependent on illiquid assets paper value. The investor has the logarithmic utility function as a limit case of a HARA-type utility. Different distributions of the liquidation time of the illiquid asset are under consideration - a classical exponential distribution and Weibull distribution that is more practically relevant. Under certain conditions we show the existence of the viscosity solution in both cases. Applying numerical methods we compare classical Merton's strategies and the optimal consumption-allocation strategies for portfolios with different liquidation-time distributions of an illiquid asset."

        "Abstract": "We evaluate from first principles the self-consistent Hartree-Fock energies for multi-soliton configurations in a doped, spin-1/2, antiferromagnetic Mott insulator on a two-dimensional square lattice. We find that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion stabilizes a regime of charged meron-antimeron vortex soliton pairs over a region of doping from 0.05 to 0.4 holes per site for intermediate coupling 3 < U/t <8. This stabilization is mediated through the generation of ``spin-flux'' in the mean-field antiferromagnetic (AFM) background. Holes cloaked by a meron-vortex in the spin-flux AFM background are charged bosons. Our static Hartree-Fock calculations provide an upper bound on the energy of a finite density of charged vortices. This upper bound is lower than the energy of the corresponding charged stripe configurations. A finite density of charge carrying vortices is shown to produce a large number of unoccupied electronic levels in the Mott-Hubbard charge transfer gap. These levels lead to significant band tailing and a broad mid-infrared band in the optical absorption spectrum as observed experimentally. At very low doping (below 0.05) the doping charges create extremely tightly bound meron-antimeron pairs or even isolated conventional spin-polarons, whereas for very high doping (above 0.4) the spin background itself becomes unstable to formation of a conventional Fermi liquid and the spin-flux mean-field is energetically unfavorable. Our results point to the predominance of a quantum liquid of charged, bosonic, vortex solitons at intermediate coupling and intermediate doping concentrations."

We assume the substrate thickness and substrate-film thermal conductivity ratio are large so that the effect of substrate thermal diffusion is retained at leading order in the long-wave approximation. As a result, system dynamics are described by a nonlinear partial differential equation for the film thickness that is nonlocally coupled to the full substrate heat equation. Perturbing about a steady quiescent state, we find that its stability is described by a non-self adjoint eigenvalue problem. We show that, under appropriate model parameters, the linearized eigenvalue problem admits complex eigenvalues that physically correspond to oscillatory (in time) instabilities of the thin film height. As the principal results of our work, we provide a complete picture of the susceptibility to oscillatory instabilities for different model parameters. Using this description, we conclude that oscillatory instabilities are more relevant experimentally for films heated by insulating substrates. Furthermore, we show that oscillatory instability where the fastest-growing (most unstable) wavenumber is complex, arises only for systems with sufficiently large substrate thicknesses."

We use a Newtonian three-dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, and model the neutron star with a soft (adiabatic index Gamma=5/3) polytropic equation of state and the black hole as a Newtonian point mass which accretes matter via an absorbing boundary at the Schwarzschild radius. Our initial conditions correspond to tidally locked binaries in equilibrium, and we have explored configurations with different values of the mass ratio q=Mns/Mbh, ranging from q=1 to q=0.1. The dynamical evolution is followed for approximately 23 ms, and in every case studied here we find that the neutron star is tidally disrupted on a dynamical timescale, forming a dense torus around the black hole that contains a few tenths of a solar mass. A nearly baryon-free axis is present in the system throughout the coalescence, and only modest beaming of a fireball that could give rise to a gamma-ray burst would be sufficient to avoid excessive baryon contamination. We find that some mass (on the order of 0.01 to 0.001 solar masses) may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could thus contribute substantially to the amount of observed r-process material in the galaxy. We calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms and luminosity in the quadrupole approximation."

We study their distribution near any fixed Landau level $2bq$, $q \\in {\\mathbb N}$. First, we obtain a sharp upper bound of the number of resonances in a vicinity of $2bq$. Moreover, under appropriate hypotheses, we establish corresponding lower bounds which imply the existence of an infinite number of resonances, or the absence of resonances in certain sectors adjoining $2bq$. Finally, we deduce a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair $(H,H_0)$ as a sum of a harmonic measure related to the resonances, and the imaginary part of a holomorphic function. This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner approximation, implies a trace formula, and provides information on the singularities of the SSF at the Landau levels."

        "Abstract": "It was previously shown by one of us that in any static, non-globally-hyperbolic, spacetime it is always possible to define a sensible dynamics for a Klein-Gordon scalar field. The prescription proposed for doing so involved viewing the spatial derivative part, $A$, of the wave operator as an operator on a certain $L^2$ Hilbert space $\\mathcal H$ and then defining a positive, self-adjoint operator on $\\mathcal H$ by taking the Friedrichs extension (or other positive extension) of $A$. However, this analysis left open the possibility that there could be other inequivalent prescriptions of a completely different nature that might also yield satisfactory definitions of the dynamics of a scalar field. We show here that this is not the case. Specifically, we show that if the dynamics agrees locally with the dynamics defined by the wave equation, if it admits a suitable conserved energy, and if it satisfies certain other specified conditions, then it must correspond to the dynamics defined by choosing some positive, self-adjoint extension of $A$ on $\\mathcal H$. Thus, subject to our requirements, the previously given prescription is the only possible way of defining the dynamics of a scalar field in a static, non-globally-hyperbolic, spacetime. In a subsequent paper, this result will be applied to the analysis of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations of anti-de Sitter spacetime. By doing so, we will determine all possible choices of boundary conditions at infinity in anti-de Sitter spacetime that give rise to sensible dynamics."

The focal point is narrowed to Dutch, a language exhibiting a large degree of word order variability. In order to overcome difficulties arising as a result of that variability, the thesis explores and expands upon a type grammar based on Multiplicative Intuitionistic Linear Logic, agnostic to word order but enriched with decorations that aim to reduce its proof-theoretic complexity. An algorithm for the conversion of dependency-annotated sentences into type sequences is then implemented, populating the type logic with concrete, data-driven lexical types. Two experiments are ran on the resulting grammar instantiation. The first pertains to the learnability of the type-assignment process by a neural architecture. A novel application of a self-attentive sequence transduction model is proposed; contrary to established practices, it constructs types inductively by internalizing the type-formation syntax, thus exhibiting generalizability beyond a pre-specified type vocabulary. The second revolves around a deductive parsing system that can resolve structural ambiguities by consulting both word and type information; preliminary results suggest both excellent computational efficiency and performance."

        "Abstract": "Approximate vanishing ideal, which is a new concept from computer algebra, is a set of polynomials that almost take a zero value for a set of given data points. The introduction of approximation to exact vanishing ideal has played a critical role in capturing the nonlinear structures of noisy data by computing the approximate vanishing polynomials. However, approximate vanishing has a theoretical problem, which has given rise to the spurious vanishing problem that any polynomial turns into an approximate vanishing polynomial by coefficient scaling. In this paper, we propose a first general method that enables many recent basis construction algorithms to overcome the spurious vanishing problem. In particular, we integrate coefficient normalization with polynomial-based basis constructions, which do not need the proper ordering of monomials to process as early basis construction algorithms. We further propose a method that takes advantages of iterative nature of basis construction so that computationally costly operations for coefficient normalization can be circumvented. Moreover, a coefficient truncation method is proposed for further acceleration. As a result of the experiments, it can be shown that the proposed method overcomes the spurious vanishing problem and significantly increases the accuracy of classification."

We point out that this result verifies a prediction made by us more than a decade ago from an analysis of a nonlocal model of QED. This model had earlier been proposed by us in an ad hoc manner to interpret certain features of multiphoton double ionization and above-threshold ionization in an atom placed in a strong laser field ; in this paper we show that the model can be obtained field- theoretically by demanding covariance of the field Lagrangian under a nonlocal U(1) gauge transformation. The model also makes direct contact with squeezed light, and thus allows us to describe these two completely different scenarios from a unified point of view.   We obtain a fundamentally new result from our nonlocal QED, namely that only the past, but not the future, can influence the present - thus establishing a non-thermodynamic arrow of time at the quantum level. We also show that correlations within a quantum system should necessarily be of the EPR-type, a result that agrees with Bell's theorem. These results follow from the simple requirement of energy conservation in matter-radiation interaction. Furthermore, we also predict new and experimentally verifiable results on the basis of our model QED."

There have remained fundamental questions whether geometrical frustration preventing magnetic long-range order can induce quantum critical phenomena and how novel they are. Here, we employ a magnetic field angle as a tuning parameter and provide thermodynamic evidence for novel quantum criticality not only driven but also augmented by frustration in the quasi-kagome Kondo-lattice CeRhSn. The field-angle-resolved landscape of the entropy reveals the existence of a quantum critical line under a magnetic field, exactly parallel to the quasi-kagome plane. In particular, on this line, we observe a two-step decrease of the entropy accompanied by a qualitative change in the non-Fermi-liquid behavior. These results suggest that a partial release of frustration induces a quantum critical \"phase\", whose nature is distinctly different from the zero-field one."

An extensive set of echoes (84 800) from four different foliages was transcribed into a spike code using a parsimonious model (linear filtering, half-wave rectification, thresholding). The spike code is assumed to consist of time differences (interspike intervals) between threshold crossings. Among the elementary interspike intervals flanked by exceedances of adjacent thresholds, a few intervals triggered by disjoint half-cycles of the carrier oscillation stand out in terms of resolvability, visibility across resolution scales and a simple stochastic structure (uncorrelatedness). They are therefore argued to be a stochastic analogue to edges in vision. A three-dimensional feature vector representing these interspike intervals sustained a reliable target classification performance (0.06% classification error) in a sequential probability ratio test, which models sequential processing of echo trains by biological sonar systems. The dimensions of the representation are the first moments of duration and amplitude location of these interspike intervals as well as their number. All three quantities are readily reconciled with known principles of neural signal representation, since they correspond to the center of gravity of excitation on a neural map and the total amount of excitation."

We offer a new method of identification of neutron star systems using a temperature - luminosity relation. If a given X-ray source is characterized by a low bolometric luminosity and a relatively high color blackbody temperature (>1 kev) it has necessarily to be a neutron star rather than a black hole. From these arguments it is shown that the area of the soft photon source must be small (r ~ 1 km) and that the accretion disk, if present, must be truncated very far from the compact object. Here we report on the possible existence of a cyclotron line around 30 kev. The presence of a neutron star in the system is strongly favored by the available data."

We suggest that the error may have its source in a non relativistic intuition that imagines the Universe not as a spacetime but separates space from time and pictures the cosmological expansion as space evolving in time. The physical reality, however, is fundamentally different -- the expanding Universe is necessarily a curved spacetime. We show here that the fact that the spacetime is curved implies that the interpretation of the observed cosmological redshift as being due to the expansion of the cosmological 3D--space is observationally verifiable. Thus it is impossible to mimic the true cosmological redshift by a Doppler effect caused by motion of galaxies in a non-expanding 3D-space, flat or curved. We summarize our points in simple spacetime diagrams that illustrate a gedanken experiment distinguishing between expansion of space and pure kinematics. We also provide all relevant mathematics. None of the previously published discussions of the issue, including a recent popular Scientific American article, offered a similarly clear way out of the confusion."

The component we identify as the host galaxy shows a moderately high unobscured star formation rate, SFR = 5 M_solar/yr, but a high SFR per unit mass, indicative of a starburst. The image components show a broad range of (R-K) colors, with two of them being very red, possibly due to dust. Overall morphology of the system can be naturally interpreted as a strong tidal interaction of two or more galaxies, at a redshift where such events were much more common than now. Given the well established causal link between galaxy mergers and starbursts, we propose that this is a strong case for a GRB originating from a merger-induced starburst system.

We present the analysis of the high-resolution (0.3-1 keV) RGS and low-resolution (0.3-10 keV) EPIC spectroscopic data. A comparison with a 1998 BeppoSAX observation suggests that XMM-Newton caught the source in a `reflection-dominated' phase, measuring the lowest continuum flux level ever (F(2-10 keV) = 2.3 x 10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1) in 2005. NGC 7582 therefore experienced a dramatic spectral transition most likely due to the partial switching-off of the nuclear activity. The XMM-Newton spectrum of the continuum emission is very complex. It can be well described by a model consisting of a combination of a heavily absorbed (Nh ~ 10^(24) cm^-2) power law and a pure reflection component both obscured by a column density of ~ 4 x 10^(22) cm^-2. Notably, we detect a significant increase by a factor of ~2 in the column density of the inner, thicker absorber covering the primary X-ray source between 2001 and 2005. The 2005 XMM-Newton spectra show the strongest Fe Kalpha emission line ever measured in this source. This is consistent with the line delayed time response to the decrease of the nuclear activity. Our analysis also reveals that the soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines from highly ionized metals. The detection of a narrow OVIII radiative recombination continuum suggests an origin in a photoionized plasma."

In capillary electrophoresis the sample migrates in a microcapillary in the presence of a background electrolyte. When the ionic concentration of the sample is sufficiently high, the signal is known to exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear waves including sharp concentration `shocks'.In this paper we consider a simplified model consisting of a single sample ion and a background electrolyte consisting of a single co-ion and a counterion in the absence of any processes that might change the ionization states of the constituents. If the ionic diffusivities are assumed to be the same for all constituents the concentration of sample ion is shown to obey a one dimensional advection diffusion equation with a concentration dependent advection velocity.If the analyte concentration is sufficiently low in a suitable non-dimensional sense, Burgers' equation is recovered, and thus, the time dependent problem is exactly solvable with arbitrary initial conditions. In the case of small diffusivity either a leading edge or trailing edge shock is formed depending on the electrophoretic mobility of the sample ion relative to the background ions. Analytical formulas are presented for the shape, width and migration velocity of the sample peak and it is shown that axial dispersion at long times may be characterized by an effective diffusivity that is exactly calculated. These results are consistent with known observations from physical and numerical simulation experiments."

A functional form for free energy was proposed based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as a correction to the Debye free energy, with a single free parameter representing the effective density of potential modes to be saturated. This parameter was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations, and found to be ~0.2 per atom.

Conventional methods for template creation and image alignment to the template have undergone decades of rich technical development. In these frameworks, templates are constructed using an iterative process of template estimation and alignment, which is often computationally very expensive. Due in part to this shortcoming, most methods compute a single template for the entire population of images, or a few templates for specific sub-groups of the data. In this work, we present a probabilistic model and efficient learning strategy that yields either universal or conditional templates, jointly with a neural network that provides efficient alignment of the images to these templates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on a variety of domains, with a special focus on neuroimaging. This is particularly useful for clinical applications where a pre-existing template does not exist, or creating a new one with traditional methods can be prohibitively expensive.

        "Abstract": "The plasma lens concept is examined as an alternative to focusing horns and solenoids for a neutrino beam facility. The concept is based on a combined high-current lens/target configuration. Current is fed at an electrode located downstream from the beginning of the target where pion capturing is needed. The current is carried by plasma outside the target. A second plasma lens section, with an additional current feed, follows the target. The plasma is immersed in a relatively small solenoidal magnetic field to facilitate its current profile shaping to optimize pion capture. Simulations of the not yet fully optimized configuration yielded a 25% higher neutrino flux at a detector situated at 3 km from the target than the horn system for the entire energy spectrum and a factor of 2.5 higher flux for neutrinos with energy larger than 3 GeV. A major advantage of plasma lenses is in background reduction. In antineutrino operation, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of close to 3 for the whole spectrum, and for energy larger than 3 GeV, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of 3.6. Plasma lenses have additional advantages: larger axial currents, high signal purity: minimal neutrino background in antineutrino runs. The lens medium consists of plasma, consequently, particle absorption and scattering is negligible. Withstanding high mechanical and thermal stresses in a plasma is not an issue."

We show that the resolvent of $H$ admits a meromorphic extension from the upper half-plane to an appropriate complex manifold ${\\mathcal M}$, and define the resonances of $H$ as the poles of this meromorphic extension. We study their distribution near any fixed Landau level $2bq$, $q \\in {\\mathbb N}$. First, we obtain a sharp upper bound of the number of resonances in a vicinity of $2bq$. Moreover, under appropriate hypotheses, we establish corresponding lower bounds which imply the existence of an infinite number of resonances, or the absence of resonances in certain sectors adjoining $2bq$. Finally, we deduce a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair $(H,H_0)$ as a sum of a harmonic measure related to the resonances, and the imaginary part of a holomorphic function. This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner approximation, implies a trace formula, and provides information on the singularities of the SSF at the Landau levels."

        "Abstract": "Classical tests of fit typically reject a model for large enough real data samples. In contrast, often in statistical practice a model offers a good description of the data even though it is not the \"true\" random generator. We consider a more flexible approach based on contamination neighbourhoods around a model. Using trimming methods and the Kolmogorov metric we introduce a functional statistic measuring departures from a contaminated model and the associated estimator corresponding to its sample version. We show how this estimator allows testing of fit for the (slightly) contaminated model vs sensible deviations from it, with uniformly exponentially small type I and type II error probabilities. We also address the asymptotic behavior of the estimator showing that, under suitable regularity conditions, it asymptotically behaves as the supremum of a Gaussian process. As an application we explore methods of comparison between descriptive models based on the paradigm of model falseness. We also include some connections of our approach with the False-Discovery-Rate setting, showing competitive behavior when estimating the contamination level, although applicable in a wider framework."

        "Abstract": "The expansion of an initially unmagnetized planar rarefaction wave has recently been shown to trigger a thermal anisotropy-driven Weibel instability (TAWI), which can generate magnetic fields from noise levels. It is examined here if the TAWI can also grow in a curved rarefaction wave. The expansion of an initially unmagnetized circular plasma cloud, which consists of protons and hot electrons, into a vacuum is modelled for this purpose with a two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. It is shown that the momentum transfer from the electrons to the radially accelerating protons can indeed trigger a TAWI. Radial current channels form and the aperiodic growth of a magnetowave is observed, which has a magnetic field that is oriented orthogonal to the simulation plane. The induced electric field implies that the electron density gradient is no longer parallel to the electric field. Evidence is presented here for that this electric field modification triggers a second magnetic instability, which results in a rotational low-frequency magnetowave. The relevance of the TAWI is discussed for the growth of small-scale magnetic fields in astrophysical environments, which are needed to explain the electromagnetic emissions by astrophysical jets. It is outlined how this instability could be examined experimentally."

        "Abstract": "The noisy Burgers equation in one spatial dimension is analyzed by means of the Martin-Siggia-Rose technique in functional form. In a canonical formulation the morphology and scaling behavior are accessed by mean of a principle of least action in the asymptotic non-perturbative weak noise limit. The ensuing coupled saddle point field equations for the local slope and noise fields, replacing the noisy Burgers equation, are solved yielding nonlinear localized soliton solutions and extended linear diffusive mode solutions, describing the morphology of a growing interface. The canonical formalism and the principle of least action also associate momentum, energy, and action with a soliton-diffusive mode configuration and thus provides a selection criterion for the noise-induced fluctuations. In a ``quantum mechanical'' representation of the path integral the noise fluctuations, corresponding to different paths in the path integral, are interpreted as ``quantum fluctuations'' and the growth morphology represented by a Landau-type quasi-particle gas of ``quantum solitons'' with gapless dispersion and ``quantum diffusive modes'' with a gap in the spectrum. Finally, the scaling properties are dicussed from a heuristic point of view in terms of a``quantum spectral representation'' for the slope correlations. The dynamic eponent z=3/2 is given by the gapless soliton dispersion law, whereas the roughness exponent zeta =1/2 follows from a regularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation. A heuristic expression for the scaling function is given by spectral representation and has a form similar to the probability distribution for Levy flights with index $z$."

To meet the physics goals, the vertex and tracking detectors require not only a spatial resolution of a few micrometers and a very low material budget, but also timing capabilities with a precision of a few nanoseconds to allow suppression of beam-induced backgrounds.   Different technologies using hybrid silicon detectors are explored for the vertex detectors, such as dedicated readout ASICs, small-pitch active edge sensors as well as capacitively coupled High-Voltage CMOS sensors. Monolithic sensors are considered as an option for the tracking detector, and a prototype using a CMOS process with a high-resistivity epitaxial layer is being designed. Different designs using a silicon-on-insulator process are under investigation for both vertex and tracking detector.   All prototypes are evaluated in laboratory and beam tests, and newly developed simulation tools combining Geant4 and TCAD are used to assess and optimize their performance.

A microbridge 1 to 5 micrometers wide is firstly designed by ion irradiating a c-axis-oriented YBa2Cu3O7 film through a gold mask such as the unprotected part becomes insulating. A lower Tc part is then defined within the bridge by irradiating with a much lower dose through a 20 nm wide narrow slit opened in a standard electronic photoresist. These planar junctions, whose settings can be finely tuned, exhibit reproducible and nearly ideal Josephson characteristics. Non hysteretic Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) like behavior is observed, together with sinc Fraunhofer patterns for rectangular junctions. The IcRn product varies with temperature ; it can reach a few mV. The typical resistance ranges from 0.1 to a few ohms, and the critical current density can be as high as 30 kA/cm2. The dispersion in characteristics is very low, in the 5% to 10% range. Such nanojunctions have been used to make microSQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) operating at Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) temperature. They exhibit a very small asymmetry, a good sensitivity and a rather low noise. The process is easily scalable to make rather complex Josephson circuits."

        "Abstract": "Current proposals focusing on neutral atoms for quantum computing are mostly based on using single atoms as quantum bits (qubits), while using cavity induced coupling or dipole-dipole interaction for two-qubit operations. An alternative approach is to use atomic ensembles as qubits. However, when an atomic ensemble is excited, by a laser beam matched to a two-level transition (or a Raman transition) for example, it leads to a cascade of many states as more and more photons are absorbed^1. In order to make use of an ensemble as a qubit, it is necessary to disrupt this cascade, and restrict the excitation to the absorption (and emission) of a single photon only. Here, we show how this can be achieved by using a new type of blockade mechanism, based on the light-shift imbalance (LSI) in a Raman transition. We describe first a simple example illustrating the concept of light shift imbalanced induced blockade (LSIIB) using a multi-level structure in a single atom, and show verifications of the analytic prediction using numerical simulations. We then extend this model to show how a blockade can be realized by using LSI in the excitation of an ensemble. Specifically, we show how the LSIIB process enables one to treat the ensemble as a two level atom that undergoes fully deterministic Rabi oscillations between two collective quantum states, while suppressing excitations of higher order collective states."

        "Abstract": "Filter banks are a popular tool for the analysis of piecewise smooth signals such as natural images. Motivated by the empirically observed properties of scale and detail coefficients of images in the wavelet domain, we propose a hierarchical deep generative model of piecewise smooth signals that is a recursion across scales: the low pass scale coefficients at one layer are obtained by filtering the scale coefficients at the next layer, and adding a high pass detail innovation obtained by filtering a sparse vector. This recursion describes a linear dynamic system that is a non-Gaussian Markov process across scales and is closely related to multilayer-convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) generative model for deep networks, except that our model allows for deeper architectures, and combines sparse and non-sparse signal representations. We propose an alternating minimization algorithm for learning the filters in this hierarchical model given observations at layer zero, e.g., natural images. The algorithm alternates between a coefficient-estimation step and a filter update step. The coefficient update step performs sparse (detail) and smooth (scale) coding and, when unfolded, leads to a deep neural network. We use MNIST to demonstrate the representation capabilities of the model, and its derived features (coefficients) for classification."

        "Abstract": "A semiclassical approximation for an evolving density operator, driven by a \"closed\" hamiltonian operator and \"open\" markovian Lindblad operators, is obtained. The theory is based on the chord function, i.e. the Fourier transform of the Wigner function. It reduces to an exact solution of the Lindblad master equation if the hamiltonian operator is a quadratic function and the Lindblad operators are linear functions of positions and momenta.   Initially, the semiclassical formulae for the case of hermitian Lindblad operators are reinterpreted in terms of a (real) double phase space, generated by an appropriate classical double Hamiltonian. An extra \"open\" term is added to the double Hamiltonian by the non-hermitian part of the Lindblad operators in the general case of dissipative markovian evolution. The particular case of generic hamiltonian operators, but linear dissipative Lindblad operators, is studied in more detail. A Liouville-type equivariance still holds for the corresponding classical evolution in double phase, but the centre subspace, which supports the Wigner function, is compressed, along with expansion of its conjugate subspace, which supports the chord function.   Decoherence narrows the relevant region of double phase space to the neighborhood of a caustic for both the Wigner function and the chord function. This difficulty is avoided by a propagator in a mixed representation, so that a further \"small-chord\" approximation leads to a simple generalization of the quadratic theory for evolving Wigner functions."

        "Abstract": "A porous scaffold is a three-dimensional network structure composed of a large number of pores, and triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) are one of conventional tools for designing porous scaffolds. However, discontinuity, incompleteness, and high storage space requirements are the three main shortcomings of TPMSs for porous scaffold design. In this study, we developed an effective method for heterogeneous porous scaffold generation to overcome the abovementioned shortcomings of TPMSs. The input of the proposed method is a trivariate B-spline solid (TBSS) with a cubic parameter domain. The proposed method first constructs a threshold distribution field (TDF) in the cubic parameter domain, and then produces a continuous and complete TPMS within it. Moreover, by mapping the TPMS in the parametric domain to the TBSS, a continuous and complete porous scaffold is generated in the TBSS. In addition, if the TBSS does not satisfy engineering requirements, the TDF can be locally modified in the parameter domain, and the porous scaffold in the TBSS can be rebuilt. We also defined a new storage space-saving file format based on the TDF to store porous scaffolds. The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method using a TBSS as well as the superior space-saving of the proposed storage format."

In this work, we propose to tackle this task knowing only 3D models of the robot and object in the particular case where the scene is viewed from uncalibrated cameras -- a situation which would be typical in an uncontrolled environment, e.g., on a construction site. We demonstrate that this localization can be performed very accurately, with millimetric errors, without using a single real image for training, a strong advantage since acquiring representative training data is a long and expensive process. Our approach relies on a classification Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained using hundreds of thousands of synthetically rendered scenes with randomized parameters. To evaluate our approach quantitatively and make it comparable to alternative approaches, we build a new rich dataset of real robot images with accurately localized blocks."

TeV gamma-ray measurements of its flaring activity and spectral variability have placed constraints on models of the high-energy emission from blazars. However, observations between 50 and 300 GeV are rare, and the high-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED), predicted to be in this range, has never been directly detected. We present a detection of Mrk 421 above 100 GeV as made by the Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) during a multiwavelength campaign in early 2004. STACEE is a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescope using the wavefront sampling technique to detect gamma rays at lower energies than achieved by most imaging Cherenkov telescopes. We also outline a method for reconstructing gamma-ray energies using a solar heliostat telescope. This technique was applied to the 2004 data, and we present the differential energy spectrum of Mrk 421 above 130 GeV. Assuming a differential photon flux dN/dE proportional to E^-a, we measure a spectral index a = 2.1 +/- 0.2 (statistical) +0.2/-0.1 (systematic). Finally, we discuss the STACEE spectrum in the context of the multiwavelength results from the same epoch."

This represents the physical situation, which could for instance have appeared in the early universe, where a cosmic membrane (thin domain wall) is located near a black hole. Considering stationary axially symmetric membranes, three different membrane-topologies are possible depending on the boundary conditions at infinity: 2+1 Minkowski topology, 2+1 wormhole topology and 2+1 black hole topology.   Interestingly, we find that the different membrane-topologies are connected via phase transitions of the form first discussed by Choptuik in investigations of scalar field collapse. More precisely, we find a first order phase transition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black hole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between Minkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a naked singularity.   For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation analogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the parameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions. We find that $Mass\\propto|\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_*|^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma\\approx 0.66$.

We utilized Brownian dynamics simulations to predict the translational and rotational fluctuations of a Janus sphere with a cap of non-matching density. The presence of the cap significantly impacted the rotational dynamics of the particle as a consequence of gravitational torque at experimentally relevant conditions. Gravitational torque dominated stochastic torque for a particle > 1 micrometer in diameter and with a 20 nm thick gold cap. Janus particles at these conditions sampled mostly cap-down or quenched orientations. Although the results summarized herein showed that particles of smaller diameter (< 1 micrometer) with a thin gold coating (< 5 nm) behave similar to an isotropic particle, small increases in either particle diameter or coating thickness drastically quenched the polar rotation of the particle. Histogram landscapes of the separation distance from the boundary and orientation observations of particles with larger diameters or thicker gold coatings were mostly populated with quenched configurations. Finally, the histogram landscapes were inverted to obtain the potential energy landscapes, providing a path for experimental data to be interpreted."

        "Abstract": "The division of galaxies into ``barred'' (SB) and ``normal'' (S) spirals is a fundamental aspect of the Hubble galaxy classification system. This ``tuning fork'' view was revised by de Vaucouleurs, whose classification volume recognized apparent ``bar strength'' (SA, SAB, SB) as a continuous property of galaxies called the ``family''. However, the SA, SAB, and SB families are purely visual judgments that can have little bearing on the actual bar strength in a given galaxy. Until very recently, published bar judgments were based exclusively on blue light images, where internal extinction or star formation can either mask a bar completely or give the false impression of a bar in a nonbarred galaxy. Near-infrared camera arrays, which principally trace the old stellar populations in both normal and barred galaxies, now facilitate a quantification of bar strength in terms of their gravitational potentials and force fields. In this paper, we show that the maximum value, Qb, of the ratio of the tangential force to the mean radial force is a quantitative measure of the strength of a bar. Qb does not measure bar ellipticity or bar shape, but rather depends on the actual forcing due to the bar embedded in its disk. We show that a wide range of true bar strengths characterizes the category ``SB'', while de Vaucouleurs category ``SAB'' corresponds to a much narrower range of bar strengths. We present Qb values for 36 galaxies, and we incorporate our bar classes into a dust-penetrated classification system for spiral galaxies."

The LB method is used as a model for the solvent in order to take into account the hydrodynamic mass and momentum transport through the solvent. The colloidal particles are propagated via MD and they are coupled to the LB fluid by viscous forces. With respect to the LB fluid, the colloids are represented by uniformly distributed points on a sphere. Each such point (with a velocity V(r) at any off-lattice position r is interacting with the neighboring eight LB nodes by a frictional force F=\\xi_0(V(r)-u(r)) with \\xi_0 being a friction force and u(r) being the velocity of the fluid at the position r. Thermal fluctuations are introduced in the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics. This coupling scheme has been proposed recently for polymer systems by Ahlrichs and D\"unweg [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 8225 (1999)]. We investigate several properties of a single colloidal particle in a LB fluid, namely the effective Stokes friction and long time tails in the autocorrelation functions for the translational and rotational velocity. Moreover, a charged colloidal system is considered consisting of a macroion, counterions and coions that are coupled to a LB fluid. We study the behavior of the ions in a constant electric field. In particular, an estimate of the effective charge of the macroion is yielded from the number of counterions that move with the macroion in the direction of the electric field."

We show that it is possible to create very realistic face videos using a single image and a set of target landmarks.

The buyer proposes the price that can differ greatly from the paper value estimated by the seller, the seller, on the other hand, can not liquidate his portfolio instantly and waits for a more favorable offer. To minimize losses in this case we need to develop new methods. One of the steps moving the theory towards practical needs is to take into account the time lag of the liquidation of an illiquid asset. This task became especially significant for the practitioners in the time of the global financial crises. Working in the Merton's optimal consumption framework with continuous time we consider an optimization problem for a portfolio with an illiquid, a risky and a risk-free asset. While a standard Black-Scholes market describes the liquid part of the investment the illiquid asset is sold at a random moment with prescribed liquidation time distribution. In the moment of liquidation it generates additional liquid wealth dependent on illiquid assets paper value. The investor has the logarithmic utility function as a limit case of a HARA-type utility. Different distributions of the liquidation time of the illiquid asset are under consideration - a classical exponential distribution and Weibull distribution that is more practically relevant. Under certain conditions we show the existence of the viscosity solution in both cases. Applying numerical methods we compare classical Merton's strategies and the optimal consumption-allocation strategies for portfolios with different liquidation-time distributions of an illiquid asset."

Stretching of a specimen implies that some loose junctions become active, which decreases the average length of a chain.   A long chain is treated as an ensemble of inextensible strands connected in sequel. Two neighboring strands are bridged by a bond which may be in two conformations: flexed (trans) and extended (cis). A bond in the flexed conformation is modeled as a linear elastic solid, whereas the mechanical energy of a bond in the extended conformation (two rigid rods directed along a straight line) is disregarded. For a virgin specimen, all bonds are in the flexed conformation. Under loading some bonds are transformed from flexed to extended conformation.   Stress-strain relations for a rubbery polymer and kinetic equations for the trans-cis transition are derived using the laws of thermodynamics. Governing equations are determined by 5 adjustable parameters which are found by fitting experimental data in uniaxial tensile tests on natural rubber vulcanizates with various amounts of crosslinks. Fair agreement is demonstrated between results of numerical simulation and observations with the elongation ratio up to $k=8$. We analyze the effects of cyclic loading, thermal annealing and recovery by swelling on the material constants."

        "Abstract": "We develop a Genetic Programming-based methodology that enables discovery of novel functional forms for classical inter-atomic force-fields, used in molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike previous efforts in the field, that fit only the parameters to the fixed functional forms, we instead use a novel algorithm to search the space of many possible functional forms. While a follow-on practical procedure will use experimental and {\\it ab inito} data to find an optimal functional form for a forcefield, we first validate the approach using a manufactured solution. This validation has the advantage of a well-defined metric of success. We manufactured a training set of atomic coordinate data with an associated set of global energies using the well-known Lennard-Jones inter-atomic potential. We performed an automatic functional form fitting procedure starting with a population of random functions, using a genetic programming functional formulation, and a parallel tempering Metropolis-based optimization algorithm. Our massively-parallel method independently discovered the Lennard-Jones function after searching for several hours on 100 processors and covering a miniscule portion of the configuration space. We find that the method is suitable for unsupervised discovery of functional forms for inter-atomic potentials/force-fields. We also find that our parallel tempering Metropolis-based approach significantly improves the optimization convergence time, and takes good advantage of the parallel cluster architecture."

There is a unique infinite matrix $(c_{ij})$ with $0,1$ entries satisfying $$ U_iU_j=(-1)^{c_{ij}}U_jU_i, \\qquad i,j=1,2,.... $$ Every matrix $(c_{ij})$ with $0,1$ entries satisfying $c_{ij}=c_{ji}$ and $c_{ii}=0$ arises from a nontrivial irreducible spin system, and there are uncountably many such matrices.   Infinite dimensional irreducible representations exist when the commutation matrix $(c_{ij})$ is of \"infinite rank\". In such cases we show that the $C^*$-algebra generated by an irreducible spin system is the CAR algebra, an infinite tensor product of copies of $M_2(\\Bbb C)$, and we classify the irreducible spin systems associated with a given matrix $(c_{ij})$ up to approximate unitary equivalence. That follows from a structural result. The $C^*$-algebra generated by the universal spin system $u_1,u_2,...$ of $(c_{ij})$ decomposes into a tensor product $C(X)\\otimes\\Cal A$, where $X$ is a Cantor set (possibly finite) and $\\Cal A$ is either the CAR algebra or a finite tensor product of copies of $M_2(\\Bbb C)$.   The Bratteli diagram technology of AF algebras is not well suited to spin systems. Instead, we work out elementary properties of the $\\Bbb Z_2$-valued \"symplectic\" form $$ \\omega(x,y) =\\sum_{p,q=1}^\\infty c_{pq}x_qy_p, $$ $x,y$ ranging over the free infninite dimensional vector space over the Galois field $\\Bbb Z_2$, and show that one can read off the structure of $C(X)\\otimes\\Cal A$ from properties of $\\omega$."

        "Abstract": "As a result of a systematic NIR H-band (1.65 micron) imaging survey of normal galaxies in the local universe, we are able to measure in a highly homogeneous way photometric and structural properties for a sample of 1143 galaxies. We base our analysis on a quantitative structural parameter, the concentration index C_31, instead of relying on the galaxies' morphological classification. The C_31 parameter provides a model independent, quantitative and continuous characterization of the light distribution within galaxies, and it is thus to be preferred to either the Hubble type or a parameter like the bulge-to-disk or bulge-to-total light ratio. We find that galaxies can be completely described by three parameters, namely: a scale parameter (the H-band luminosity), a shape parameter (the concentration index C_31) and a colour parameter (e.g. the B-H colour). At low luminosity dEs and dIs, having similar C_31, are colour-discriminated, while at very high luminosity different C_31 discriminate S0s from Scs, otherwise undistinguishable on the basis of their colour. A single, monotonic relation exists between luminosity and mu_e in the H-band, as opposed to the two separate regimes that are generally observed in the B-band. As NIR luminosity traces quite accurately the galaxy mass distribution, this relation re-enforces the indication in favour of a scale-dependent mass collapse mechanism which produces higher surface-brightness and more centrally peaked galaxies with increasing mass. However, the presence of high-luminosity low-C_31 galaxies hints at other machanisms and physical properties (such as angular momentum) playing an important role in galaxy formation. (abridged)"

This technique is based on tensor computation. A tensor is a high-dimensional generalization of a matrix or a vector. By exploiting the hidden low-rank property of a high-dimensional data array, the large amount of unknown variation testing data may be predicted from a few random measurement samples. The tensor rank, which decides the complexity of a tensor representation, is decided by an available variational Bayesian approach. Our approach is validated by a practical chip testing data set, and it can be easily generalized to characterize the process variations of multiple wafers. Our approach is more efficient than the previous virtual probe techniques in terms of memory and computational cost when handling high-dimensional chip testing data."

EKGs contain useful diagnostic information about patient health that may be absent from other electronic health record (EHR) data. As multi-dimensional waveforms, they could be modeled using generic machine learning tools, such as a linear factor model or a variational autoencoder. We take a different approach:~we specify a model that directly represents the underlying electrophysiology of the heart and the EKG measurement process. We apply our model to two datasets, including a sample of emergency department EKG reports with missing data. We show that our model can more accurately reconstruct missing data (measured by test reconstruction error) than a standard baseline when there is significant missing data. More broadly, this physiological representation of heart function may be useful in a variety of settings, including prediction, causal analysis, and discovery."

        "Abstract": "Weak scale supersymmetry is often said to be fine-tuned, especially if the matter content is minimal. This is not true if there is a large A term for the top squarks. We present a systematic study on fine-tuning in minimal supersymmetric theories and identify low energy spectra that do not lead to severe fine-tuning. Characteristic features of these spectra are: a large A term for the top squarks, small top squark masses, moderately large tan\\beta, and a small \\mu parameter. There are classes of theories leading to these features, which are discussed. In one class, which allows a complete elimination of fine-tuning, the Higgsinos are the lightest among all the superpartners of the standard model particles, leading to three nearly degenerate neutralino/chargino states. This gives interesting signals at the LHC -- the dilepton invariant mass distribution has a very small endpoint and shows a particular shape determined by the Higgsino nature of the two lightest neutralinos. We demonstrate that these signals are indeed useful in realistic analyses by performing Monte Carlo simulations, including detector simulations and background estimations. We also present a method that allows the determination of all the relevant superparticle masses without using input from particular models, despite the limited kinematical information due to short cascades. This allows us to test various possible models, which is demonstrated in the case of a model with mixed moduli-anomaly mediation. We also give a simple derivation of special renormalization group properties associated with moduli mediated supersymmetry breaking, which are relevant in a model without fine-tuning."

We demonstrate that the dynamics of the FRW model with dark energy in the form of phantom field can be regarded as a scattering process of two types: multiple chaotic and classical non-chaotic. It depends whether the spontaneously symmetry breaking takes place. In the first class of models with the spontaneously symmetry breaking the dynamics is similar to the Yang-Mills theory. We find the evidence of a fractal structure in the phase space of initial conditions. We observe similarities to the phenomenon of a multiple scattering process around the origin. In turn the class of models without the spontaneously symmetry breaking can be described as the classical non-chaotic scattering process and the methods of symbolic dynamic are also used in this case. We show that the phantom cosmology can be treated as a simple model with scattering of trajectories which character depends crucially on a sign of a square of mass. We demonstrate that there is a possibility of chaotic behavior in the flat Universe with a conformally coupled phantom field in the system considered on non-zero energy level. We obtain that the acceleration is a generic feature in the considered model without the spontaneously symmetry breaking. We observe that the effective EOS coefficient oscillates and then approach to $w=-1$."

Ground manifold of the polar centers includes three terms $^{1}A_{1g}$ (Zhang-Rice singlet), $^{1}E_{u}$, $^{3}E_{u}$ with different spin multiplicity, orbital degeneracy and parity that provides an unconventional multi-mode behaviour of the cuprates. The spin subsystem of the copper oxides within the polar Jahn-Teller $CuO_{4}$ centers model is a two-component spin liquid and corresponds to a singlet-triplet magnet with possible noncollinear spin configurations. In the framework of a modified mean field approximation some kinds of spin ordering are discussed including as a trivial singlet or triplet states as a pure quantum singlet-triplet mixed state. A local boson movement is accompanied by a modulation of the spin density on the site resulting in the so called induced spin fluctuations. Some unconventional features of the induced spin fluctuations are considered including an appearance of the induced longitudinal ferrimagnetism with an appropriate contribution to the spin susceptibility, a possibility to observe and examine the charge fluctuations with the help of the traditional magnetic methods such as the magnetic inelastic neutron scattering and the spin lattice relaxation experiments. The suggested model, in comparison with the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi-liquid model, represents new approach to the description of the spin system of the high-$T_c$ cuprates."

A conceptual foundation for the wave nature of a quantum state has recently been presented, through the notion of quantum coherence. We introduce here a parallel notion for the particle nature of a quantum state of an arbitrary physical situation.

The authors observe in the linear excitation regime the formation of density and phase patterns reminiscent of those expected in the non-linear regime from the nucleation of dark solitons. Based on this observation, they conclude that previous theoretical and experimental reports on dark solitons in a polariton system should be revised. Here we comment why the results from Cilibrizzi et al. take place in a very different regime than previous investigations on dark soliton nucleation and do not reproduce all the signatures of its rich nonlinear phenomenology. First of all, Cilibrizzi et al. consider a particular type of radial excitation that strongly determines the observed patterns, while in previous reports the excitation has a plane-wave profile. Most importantly, the nonlinear relation between phase jump, soliton width and fluid velocity, and the existence of a critical velocity with the time-dependent formation of vortex-antivortex pairs are absent in the linear regime. In previous reports about dark soliton and half-dark soliton nucleation in a polariton fluid, the distinctive dark soliton physics is supported both by theory (analytical and numerical) and experiments (both continuous wave and pulsed excitation)."

For initialization, it is assumed that an accurate knowledge of the subspace in which $L_0$ lies is available. In recent works, Qiu et al proposed and analyzed a novel solution to this problem called recursive projected compressed sensing or ReProCS. In this work, we relax one limiting assumption of Qiu et al's result. Their work required that the $L_t$'s be mutually independent over time. However this is not a practical assumption, e.g., in the video application, $L_t$ is the background image sequence and one would expect it to be correlated over time. In this work we relax this and allow the $L_t$'s to follow an autoregressive model. We are able to show that under mild assumptions and under a denseness assumption on the unestimated part of the changed subspace, with high probability (w.h.p.), ReProCS can exactly recover the support set of $S_t$ at all times; the reconstruction errors of both $S_t$ and $L_t$ are upper bounded by a time invariant and small value; and the subspace recovery error decays to a small value within a finite delay of a subspace change time. Because the last assumption depends on an algorithm estimate, this result cannot be interpreted as a correctness result but only a useful step towards it."

The inner section of this SNR, within 2 degrees of the pulsar PSR B0833-45, has been observed by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray atmospheric Cherenkov detector in 2004 and 2005. A strong signal is seen from an extended region to the south of the pulsar, within an integration region of radius 0.8 deg. around the position (RA = 08h 35m 00s, dec = -45 deg. 36' J2000.0). The excess coincides with a region of hard X-ray emission seen by the ROSAT and ASCA satellites. The observed energy spectrum of the source between 550 GeV and 65 TeV is well fit by a power law function with photon index = 1.45 +/- 0.09(stat) +/- 0.2(sys) and an exponential cutoff at an energy of 13.8 +/- 2.3(stat) +/- 4.1(sys) TeV. The integral flux above 1 TeV is (1.28 +/- 0.17 (stat) +/- 0.38(sys)) x 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. This result is the first clear measurement of a peak in the spectral energy distribution from a VHE gamma-ray source, likely related to inverse Compton emission. A fit of an Inverse Compton model to the H.E.S.S. spectral energy distribution gives a total energy in non-thermal electrons of ~2 x 10^{45} erg between 5 TeV and 100 TeV, assuming a distance of 290 parsec to the pulsar.

Dust with similar A_V for the the host galaxy as a whole appears to be required by the measurement of a Balmer decrement in the spectrum of the host galaxy.

The most natural mechanism by which the SMNS can lose its rotational energy is through a strong pulsar type wind, between the supernova and the GRB events, which is expected to create a PWB. We analyze in some detail the observational implications of such a plerionic environment on the afterglow (AG) and prompt GRB emissions, and the prospect for direct detection of the plerion emission. We find that for a simple spherical model, GRBs with iron lines detected in the X-ray AG should not have a detectable radio afterglow, and should have small jet break times and non-relativistic transition times, in disagreement with observations for some of the GRBs with X-ray lines. These discrepancies with the observations may be reconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry, where the PWB is elongated along the polar axis. We find that lack of detection of the plerion emission provides interesting constraints on the model parameters. Finally, we predict that the inverse Compton upscattering of the PWB photons by the relativistic electrons of the AG (external Compton, EC) should lead to high energy emission during the early AG that might explain the GeV photons detected by EGRET for a few GRBs, and should be detectable by future missions such as GLAST."

We empirically observe that as the expressiveness of the provided grammar increases, the performance of these tools degrades significantly.   We claim that this degradation is not only due to a larger search space, but also due to overfitting. We formally define this phenomenon and prove no-free-lunch theorems for SyGuS, which reveal a fundamental tradeoff between synthesizer performance and grammar expressiveness.   A standard approach to mitigate overfitting in machine learning is to run multiple learners with varying expressiveness in parallel. We demonstrate that this insight can immediately benefit existing SyGuS tools.

These examples illustrate the formal structure of thermodynamics developed by Callen as applied to a gravitational configuration as well as the phenomenological manner in which Einstein equations largely determine the thermodynamical equations of state. We consider in detail the thermodynamics and quasi-static collapse of a self-gravitating shell. This includes a discussion of intrinsic stability for a one-parameter family of thermal equations of state and the interpretation of the Bekenstein bound. The entropy growth associated with a collapsing sequence of equilibrium states of a shell is computed under different boundary conditions in the quasi-static approximation and compared with black hole entropy.

A Wind Blwon Bubble (WBB) scenario is emplyed, in which a fast, tenuous wind from a Blue Supergiant expands into a slow, dense wind, expelled during an earlier Red Supergiant phase. The bipolar shapre develops due to a pole-to-equator density contrast in the slow wind (ie, the slow wind forms a slow torus). We use the Wind Compressed Disk (WCD) model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli (1992) to determine the shape of the slow torus. In the WCD scenario, the shape of the torus is determined by the rotation of the progenitor star. We then use a self-similar semi-analytical method for wind blown bubble evolution to determine the shape of the resulting bipolar nebula.   We find that the union of the wind-compressed-disk and bipolar-wind-blown- bubble models allows us to recover the salient properties of SN1987A's circumstellar nebula. In particular, the size, speed and density of SN1987A's inner ring are easily reproduced in our calculations. An exploration of parameter space shows the the red supergiant progenitor must be been rotating at > 0.3 of its breakup speed. We conclude that the progenitor was most likely spun up by a merger with a binary companion. Using a simple model for the binary merger we find that the companion is likely to have had a mass > 0.5 M_sun."

There is a unique infinite matrix $(c_{ij})$ with $0,1$ entries satisfying $$ U_iU_j=(-1)^{c_{ij}}U_jU_i, \\qquad i,j=1,2,.... $$ Every matrix $(c_{ij})$ with $0,1$ entries satisfying $c_{ij}=c_{ji}$ and $c_{ii}=0$ arises from a nontrivial irreducible spin system, and there are uncountably many such matrices.   Infinite dimensional irreducible representations exist when the commutation matrix $(c_{ij})$ is of \"infinite rank\". In such cases we show that the $C^*$-algebra generated by an irreducible spin system is the CAR algebra, an infinite tensor product of copies of $M_2(\\Bbb C)$, and we classify the irreducible spin systems associated with a given matrix $(c_{ij})$ up to approximate unitary equivalence. That follows from a structural result. The $C^*$-algebra generated by the universal spin system $u_1,u_2,...$ of $(c_{ij})$ decomposes into a tensor product $C(X)\\otimes\\Cal A$, where $X$ is a Cantor set (possibly finite) and $\\Cal A$ is either the CAR algebra or a finite tensor product of copies of $M_2(\\Bbb C)$.   The Bratteli diagram technology of AF algebras is not well suited to spin systems. Instead, we work out elementary properties of the $\\Bbb Z_2$-valued \"symplectic\" form $$ \\omega(x,y) =\\sum_{p,q=1}^\\infty c_{pq}x_qy_p, $$ $x,y$ ranging over the free infninite dimensional vector space over the Galois field $\\Bbb Z_2$, and show that one can read off the structure of $C(X)\\otimes\\Cal A$ from properties of $\\omega$."

The active galaxy M87 offers a convenient test case for the method due to the existence of a large amount of observational data on the jet and ambient environment properties in the central area of the object. We suggest that the observed transition of a jet boundary shape from a parabolic to a conical form is associated with the flow transiting from the magnetically dominated regime to the energy equipartition between plasma bulk motion and magnetic field. By coupling the unique set of observations available for the jet kinematics, environment and boundary profile with our MHD modelling under assumption on the presence of a dynamically important magnetic field in the M87 jet, we estimate the central black hole mass and spin. The method leads us to believe that the M87 super massive black hole has a mass somewhat larger than typically accepted so far."

Specifically, we show that there always exist two regions in the parameter space. In one region, the system possesses one single phase. However in the other region, there could coexist three phases and a van der Waals-like phase transition occurs.

The model was stimulated by our discovery that a majority of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used in other papers (cond-mat/0212043). It accounted quantitatively for several properties of empirically observed distribution of citations. However, important features, such as power-law distribution of citations to papers published during the same year and the fact that the average rate of citing decreases with aging of a paper, were not accounted for by that model. Here we propose a modified model: when a scientist writes a manuscript, he picks up several random recent papers, cites them and also copies some of their references. The difference with the original model is the word recent. We solve the model using methods of the theory of branching processes, and find that it can explain the aforementioned features of citation distribution, which our original model couldn't account for. The model can also explain \"sleeping beauties in science\", i.e., papers that are little cited for a decade or so, and later \"awake\" and get a lot of citations. Although much can be understood from purely random models, we find that to obtain a good quantitative agreement with empirical citation data one must introduce Darwinian fitness parameter for the papers."

The 0-form in the complex is a non $C^0$ nonconforming element space for biharmonic problems. This plate element contains only 12 degrees of freedom (DoFs) over a rectangular cell with a zeroth order weak continuity for the normal derivative, therefore only the lowest convergence order can be obtained by a standard consistency error analysis. Nevertheless, we prove that, if the rectangular mesh is uniform, an $O(h^2)$ convergence rate in discrete $H^2$-norm will be achieved. Moreover, based on a duality argument, it has an $O(h^3)$ convergence order in discrete $H^1$-norm if the solution region is convex. The 1-form and 2-form constitute a divergence-free pair for incompressible flow. We also show its higher accuracy than that derived from a usual error estimate under uniform partitions, which explains the phenomenon observed in our previous work.

In this paper, we propose convolutional Poisson factor analysis (CPFA) that directly operates on a lossless representation that processes the words in each document as a sequence of high-dimensional one-hot vectors. To boost its performance, we further propose the convolutional Poisson gamma belief network (CPGBN) that couples CPFA with the gamma belief network via a novel probabilistic pooling layer. CPFA forms words into phrases and captures very specific phrase-level topics, and CPGBN further builds a hierarchy of increasingly more general phrase-level topics. For efficient inference, we develop both a Gibbs sampler and a Weibull distribution based convolutional variational auto-encoder. Experimental results demonstrate that CPGBN can extract high-quality text latent representations that capture the word order information, and hence can be leveraged as a building block to enrich a wide variety of existing latent variable models that ignore word order."

        "Abstract": "A long laser beam propagating through an underdense plasma produces a positively charged ion channel by expelling plasma electrons in the transverse direction. We consider the dynamics of a test electron in a resulting two-dimensional channel under the action of the laser field and the transverse electric field of the channel. A considerable enhancement of the axial momentum can be achieved in this case via amplification of betatron oscillations. It is shown that the oscillations can be parametrically amplified when the betatron frequency, which increases with the wave amplitude, becomes comparable to the frequency of its modulations. The modulations are caused by non-inertial (accelerated/decelerated) relativistic axial motion induced by the wave regardless of the angle between the laser electric field and the field of the channel. We have performed a parameter scan for a wide range of wave amplitudes and ion densities and we have found that, for a given density, there is a well pronounced wave amplitude threshold above which the maximum electron energy is considerably enhanced. We have also calculated a time-integrated electron spectrum produced by an ensemble of electrons with a spread in the initial transverse momentum. The numerical results show that the considerable energy enhancement is accompanied by spectrum broadening. The presented mechanism of energy enhancement is robust with respect to an axial increase of ion density, because it relies on a threshold phenomenon rather than on a narrow linear resonance."

Next, we calculate the electrical susceptibility of a three-level quantum system (as a model for the two-dimensional electron gas trapped in the waveguide), by using phenomenological optical Bloch equations. We show that the two-dimensional electron gas behaves as a conducting interface, whose conductivity can be modified by controlling the populations of electrons and holes the energy levels. Finally, we design a slab waveguide in which a guided wave with the wavelength of 1.55um experiences a strong coupling to the conducting interface. We calculate the propagation constant of the wave in the waveguide subject to the conducting interface, by exploiting the modified transfer matrix method, and establish it linear dependence on the interface conductivity. By presenting a method for controlling the populations of electrons and holes, we design a compact optical modulator with an overall length of around 60um."

Two-particle spectroscopic factors derived from Monte Carlo Shell Model calculations are used, together with the sequential description of the two-particle transfer reaction mechanism. The calculation shows a clear signature for a shape phase transition between $^{98}$Zr and $^{100}$Zr, which displays coexistence of a deformed ground state with an excited spherical $0^+$ state.

Subsequently, it has been argued that the predictions of the SLC are inconsistent with general thermodynamic principles. Here we reconsider the thermodynamic viability of the SLC by examining a model equation of state for water first studied to clarify the relationship of the SLC to the proposed liquid-liquid phase transition in supercooled water. By demonstrating that a binodal may terminate on a spinodal at a point that is not a critical point, we show that the SLC is thermodynamically permissible in a system that has both a liquid-gas and a liquid-liquid phase transition. We also describe and clarify other unusual thermodynamic behavior that may arise in such a system, particularly that associated with the so-called \"critical-point-free\" scenario for a liquid-liquid phase transition, which may apply to the case of liquid Si."

A regulator imposes a floor on the amount of energy each regulated firm must generate from solar power in a given period and provides them with certificates for each generated MWh. Firms offset these certificates against the floor and pay a penalty for any lacking certificates. Certificates are tradable assets, allowing firms to purchase/sell them freely. In this work, we formulate a stochastic control problem for generating and trading in SREC markets from a regulated firm's perspective. We account for generation and trading costs, the impact both have on SREC prices, provide a characterization of the optimal strategy, and develop a numerical algorithm to solve this control problem. Through numerical experiments, we explore how a firm who acts optimally behaves under various conditions. We find that an optimal firm's generation and trading behaviour can be separated into various regimes, based on the marginal benefit of obtaining an additional SREC, and validate our theoretical characterization of the optimal strategy. We also conduct parameter sensitivity experiments and conduct comparisons of the optimal strategy to other candidate strategies."

In practice, however, the contrarian tendency is rarely followed when there is an overwhelming majority with a given opinion, which denotes a social norm. Such reasonable contrarian behavior is often considered a mark of independent thought, and can be a useful strategy in financial markets.   We present the opinion dynamics of a society of reasonable contrarian agents. The model is a cellular automaton of Ising type, with antiferromagnetic pair interactions modeling contrarianism and plaquette terms modeling social norms. We introduce the entropy of the collective variable as a way of comparing deterministic (mean-field) and probabilistic (simulations) bifurcation diagrams.   In the mean field approximation the model exhibits bifurcations and a chaotic phase, interpreted as coherent oscillations of the whole society. However, in a one-dimensional spatial arrangement one observes incoherent oscillations and a constant average.   In simulations on Watts-Strogatz networks with a small-world effect the mean field behavior is recovered, with a bifurcation diagram that resembles the mean-field one, but using the rewiring probability as the control parameter. Similar bifurcation diagrams are found for scale free networks, and we are able to compute an effective connectivity for such networks."

Considering stationary axially symmetric membranes, three different membrane-topologies are possible depending on the boundary conditions at infinity: 2+1 Minkowski topology, 2+1 wormhole topology and 2+1 black hole topology.   Interestingly, we find that the different membrane-topologies are connected via phase transitions of the form first discussed by Choptuik in investigations of scalar field collapse. More precisely, we find a first order phase transition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black hole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between Minkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a naked singularity.   For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation analogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the parameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions. We find that $Mass\\propto|\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_*|^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma\\approx 0.66$.

Given a black-box classifier, we aim to eliminate the performance gap by perturbing the distribution of input variables for the disadvantaged group. We refer to the perturbed distribution as a counterfactual distribution, and characterize its properties for common fairness criteria. We introduce a descent algorithm to learn a counterfactual distribution from data. We then discuss how the estimated distribution can be used to build a data preprocessor that can reduce disparate impact without training a new model.

This drag force acts in the direction -\\hat V, and arises from the gravitational attraction between the perturber and its wake in the ambient medium. For supersonic motion (M=V/c_s>1), the enhanced-density wake is confined to the Mach cone trailing the perturber; for subsonic motion (M<1), the wake is confined to a sphere of radius c_s t centered a distance V t behind the perturber. Inside the wake, surfaces of constant density are hyperboloids or oblate spheroids for supersonic or subsonic perturbers, respectively, with the density maximal nearest the perturber. The dynamical drag force has the form F_df= - I 4\\pi (G M_p)^2\\rho_0/V^2. We evaluate I analytically; its limits are I\\to M^3/3 for M<<1 and I\\to ln(Vt/r_min) for M>>1.

This paper focuses on graph classes with bounded layered treewidth, which include planar graphs, graphs of bounded Euler genus, graphs embeddable on a fixed surface with a bounded number of crossings per edge, amongst other examples. Our main theorem says that for fixed integers $s,t,k$, every graph with layered treewidth at most $k$ and with no $K_{s,t}$ subgraph is $(s+2)$-colorable with bounded clustering. In the $s=1$ case, which corresponds to graphs of bounded maximum degree, we obtain polynomial bounds on the clustering. This greatly improves a corresponding result of Esperet and Joret for graphs of bounded genus. The $s=3$ case implies that every graph with a drawing on a fixed surface with a bounded number of crossings per edge is 5-colorable with bounded clustering.

In one example the trace anomaly comes from the matter sector -- a novel, closed form, generalisation of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution with an $F^4$ correction -- whereas in the other example it comes from the geometry sector -- a noncommutative geometry generalization of the Schwarzschild black hole. For comparison, we also consider the scalarisation of a black hole surrounded by (non-conformally invariant) classical matter (Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes). We find that the scalarised solutions are, generically, entropically favoured."

        "Abstract": "Complex systems often have features that can be modeled by advanced mathematical tools [1]. Of special interests are the features of complex systems that have a network structure as such systems are important for modeling technological and social processes [3, 4]. In our previous research we have discussed the flow of a single substance in a channel of network. It may happen however that two substances flow in the same channel of network. In addition the substances may react and then the question arises about the distribution of the amounts of the substances in the segments of the channel. A study of the dynamics of the flow of the substances as well as a study of the distribution of the substances is presented in this paper on the base of a discrete - time model of flow of substances in the nodes of a channel of a network."

        "Title": "Quantum Time Uncertainty in a Gravity's Rainbow Formalism",
        "Abstract": "The existence of a minimum time uncertainty is usually argued to be a consequence of the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Most of the studies that point to this result are nonetheless based on perturbative quantization approaches, in which the effect of matter on the geometry is regarded as a correction to a classical background. In this paper, we consider rainbow spacetimes constructed from doubly special relativity by using a modification of the proposals of Magueijo and Smolin. In these models, gravitational effects are incorporated (at least to a certain extent) in the definition of the energy-momentum of particles without adhering to a perturbative treatment of the back reaction. In this context, we derive and compare the expressions of the time uncertainty in quantizations that use as evolution parameter either the background or the rainbow time coordinates. These two possibilities can be regarded as corresponding to perturbative and non-perturbative quantization schemes, respectively. We show that, while a non-vanishing time uncertainty is generically unavoidable in a perturbative framework, an infinite time resolution can in fact be achieved in a non-perturbative quantization for the whole family of doubly special relativity theories with unbounded physical energy."

The fields in the theory consist of: a metric on X, a connection on P and a B-field which is, roughly speaking, a two-form on X. As in a gauge theory, these fields are considered up to gauge equivalence. This means that the connection is considered up to bundle isomorphism, that the metric is considered up to diffeomorphism equivalence, and that the two-form B is considered up to equivalence by adding exact two-forms. The fact that B has a gauge invariance implies that it is not in fact a globally defined two-form but rather must be given as a gerbe-like object. The purpose of this paper is to give a precise definition of the mathematical nature of the B-field following the recent work of Freed and then to work out a description of the moduli space of 8-dimensional Euclidean invariant classical solutions to the string Equations of Motion in the case when space-time is compactified along a two-torus."

For statistics related to count-in-cells, such as factorial moments, F_k, the average correlation function, xiav, and cumulants, S_N, the functions Upsilon(VF_k), Upsilon(Vxiav), and Upsilon(VS_N) were measured in a large tauCDM simulation. This N-body experiment simulates almost the full ``Hubble Volume'' of the universe, thus, for the first time, it allowed for an accurate analysis of the cosmic distribution function, and, in particular, of its variance (Delta A)^2, the cosmic error. The resulting detailed knowledge about the shape of Upsilon is crucial for likelihood analyses. The measured cosmic error agrees remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of Szapudi & Colombi (1996) and Szapudi, Bernardeau & Colombi (1998) in the weakly non-linear regime, while the predictions are slightly above the measurements in the highly nonlinear regime. When the relative cosmic error is small, (Delta A/A)^2, function Upsilon is nearly Gaussian. When (Delta A/A)^2 approaches unity or is larger, function Upsilon(VA) is increasingly skewed and well approximated by a lognormal distribution for A=F_k, or A=xiav. The measured cumulants follow accurately the perturbation theory predictions in the weakly nonlinear regime.

The models studied include not only a spherically symmetric hot matter shell with constant particle number but also a black hole characterized by a general thermal equation of state. These examples illustrate the formal structure of thermodynamics developed by Callen as applied to a gravitational configuration as well as the phenomenological manner in which Einstein equations largely determine the thermodynamical equations of state. We consider in detail the thermodynamics and quasi-static collapse of a self-gravitating shell. This includes a discussion of intrinsic stability for a one-parameter family of thermal equations of state and the interpretation of the Bekenstein bound. The entropy growth associated with a collapsing sequence of equilibrium states of a shell is computed under different boundary conditions in the quasi-static approximation and compared with black hole entropy. Although explicit expressions involve empirical coefficients, these are constrained by physical conditions of thermodynamical origin. The absence of a Gibbs-Duhem relation and the associated scaling laws for self-gravitating matter systems are presented."

        "Abstract": "Amplifiers are ubiquitous in electronics and play a fundamental role in a wide range of scientific measurements. From a user's perspective, an ideal amplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a high dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little distortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these characteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer multi-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise remains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers and are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power from a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely reactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the quantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson parametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow band and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a superconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations. The amplifier is very simple, consisting only of a patterned metal film on a dielectric substrate, and relies on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2 GHz on either side of an 11.56 GHz pump tone, and we place an upper limit on the added noise of the amplifier of 3.4 photons at 9.4 GHz. Furthermore, the dynamic range is very large, comparable to microwave transistor amplifiers, and the concept can be applied throughout the microwave, millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave bands."

Initially, we employ a false vacuum potential system; however ,when cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein cosmological constant at the end of chaotic inflation, the initial di quark scalar field is not consistent with respect to a semi classical consistency conditions we analyze as the potential changes to the chaotic inflationary potential utilized by Guth. We use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero during initial inflationary cosmology, and obtain a sound speed approaching unity as the slope of the scalar field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All this is to aid in a data reconstruction problem of how to account for the initial origins of CMB due to dark matter since effective field theories as presently constructed require a cut off value for applicability of their potential structure. This is often at the cost of, especially in early universe theoretical models, of clearly defined baryogenesis, and of a well defined mechanism of phase transitions."

The unperturbed dynamical system has a bound state, a spatially localized and time periodic solution. We show that, for generic nonlinear Hamiltonian perturbations, all small amplitude solutions decay to zero as time tends to infinity at an anomalously slow rate.   In particular, spatially localized and time-periodic solutions of the linear problem are destroyed by generic nonlinear Hamiltonian perturbations via slow radiation of energy to infinity. These solutions can therefore be thought of as metastable states.   The main mechanism is a nonlinear resonant interaction of bound states (eigenfunctions) and radiation (continuous spectral modes), leading to energy transfer from the discrete to continuum modes.   This is in contrast to the KAM theory in which appropriate nonresonance conditions imply the persistence of invariant tori. A hypothesis ensuring that such a resonance takes place is a nonlinear analogue of the Fermi golden rule, arising in the theory of resonances in quantum mechanics. The techniques used involve: (i) a time-dependent method developed by the authors for the treatment of the quantum resonance problem and perturbations of embedded eigenvalues, (ii) a generalization of the Hamiltonian normal form appropriate for infinite dimensional dispersive systems and (iii) ideas from scattering theory. The arguments are quite general and we expect them to apply to a large class of systems which can be viewed as the interaction of finite dimensional and infinite dimensional dispersive dynamical systems, or as a system of particles coupled to a field."

Deprojection is ill-posed-- often there are many plausible solutions for a given input. We first propose a probabilistic model capturing the ambiguity of the task. We then present a variational inference strategy using convolutional neural networks as functional approximators. Sampling from the inference network at test time yields plausible candidates from the distribution of original signals that are consistent with a given input projection. We evaluate the method on several datasets for both spatial and temporal deprojection tasks. We first demonstrate the method can recover human gait videos and face images from spatial projections, and then show that it can recover videos of moving digits from dramatically motion-blurred images obtained via temporal projection."

We investigate these analytically. The non-axisymmetric Rayleigh-Taylor and axisymmetric Kelvin-Helmholtz linear instabilities are potential sources of destabilization of the subsonic accretion flow after the shock. A local Lagrangian approach is used in order to evaluate the efficiency of these linear instabilities. However, the conditions required for such a WKB type approximation are fulfilled only marginally: a quantitative estimate of their local growth rate integrated along a flow line shows that their growth time is at best comparable to the time needed for advection onto the accretor, even at high Mach number and for a small accretor size. Despite this apparently low efficiency, several features of these mechanisms qualitatively match those observed in numerical simulations: in a gas with uniform entropy, the instability occurs only for supersonic accretors. It is nonaxisymmetric, and begins close to the accretor in the equatorial region perpendicular to the symmetry axis. The mechanism is more efficient for a small, highly supersonic accretor, and also if the shock is detached. We also show by a 3-D numerical simulation an example of unstable accretion of a subsonic flow with non-uniform entropy at infinity. This instability is qualitatively similar to the one observed in 3-D simulations of the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flow, although it involves neither a bow shock nor an accretion line."

Although it is widely accepted that long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, at least two fundamentally different scenarios concerning the final collapse are currently being considered. Delayed reddened excesses in the optical afterglows of several GRBs indicate that a supernova, possibly of Type Ic, takes place within a few days of a GRB. This supports the collapsar model, where the core of a massive star collapses promptly to a black hole. Variable X-ray features observed in the prompt and afterglow spectra of several GRBs, suggest that a highly metal enriched and dense shell of material surrounds the sources of GRBs. In some cases, evidence for expansion of these shells with velocities of a substantial fraction of the speed of light has been claimed. These observations have been interpreted as support for the supranova model, where a massive star collapses first to a supramassive neutron star, which later collapses to a black hole following loss of rotational support. In this review paper, I will present a brief overview of the current status of the observational evidence for X-ray spectral features in GRBs, and discuss their implications for both the collapsar and the supranova model."

We consider both deterministic biasing, where $f$ is simply a function, and stochastic biasing, in which the galaxy density is a random variable whose distribution depends on the matter density: $\\delta_g=X(\\delta)$. We show that even when this mapping is performed on a highly nonlinear density field with a hierarchical correlation structure, the correlation function $\\xi$ is simply scaled up by a constant, as long as $\\xi << 1$. In stochastic biasing models, the galaxy autocorrelation function behaves exactly as in deterministic models, with the mean value of $X$ for a given value of $\\delta$ taking the role of the deterministic bias function. We extend our results to the power spectrum P(k), showing that for sufficiently small k, the effect of local biasing is equivalent to the multiplication of P(k) by a constant, with the addition of a constant term.

On the other hand, a magnetic field acting on an open Fermi surface induces a dimensional crossover by confining the electronic wave-functions wave-functions along the chains of highest conductivity, which results in a divergence of the orbital critical field and in a stabilization at low temperature of a cascade of superconducting phases separated by first order transistions. In this paper, we study the phase diagram as a function of the anisotropy. We discuss in details the experimental situation in the quasi-1D organic conductors of the Bechgaard salts family and argue that they appear as good candidates for the observation of the LOFF state, provided that their anisotropy is large enough. Recent experiments on the organic quasi-1D superconductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ are in agreement with the results obtained in this paper and could be interpreted as a signature of a high-field superconducting phase.

        "Abstract": "Starting from a system of $N$ radial Schr\\\"odinger equations with a vanishing potential and finite threshold differences between the channels, a coupled $N \\times N$ exactly-solvable potential model is obtained with the help of a single non-conservative supersymmetric transformation. The obtained potential matrix, which subsumes a result obtained in the literature, has a compact analytical form, as well as its Jost matrix. It depends on $N (N+1)/2$ unconstrained parameters and on one upper-bounded parameter, the factorization energy. A detailed study of the model is done for the $2\\times 2$ case: a geometrical analysis of the zeros of the Jost-matrix determinant shows that the model has 0, 1 or 2 bound states, and 0 or 1 resonance; the potential parameters are explicitly expressed in terms of its bound-state energies, of its resonance energy and width, or of the open-channel scattering length, which solves schematic inverse problems. As a first physical application, exactly-solvable $2\\times 2$ atom-atom interaction potentials are constructed, for cases where a magnetic Feshbach resonance interplays with a bound or virtual state close to threshold, which results in a large background scattering length."

        "Title": "A closed linkage mechanism having the shape of a discrete M\u00f6bius strip",
        "Abstract": "A closed linkage mechanism in three-dimensional space is an object comprising rigid bodies connected with hinges in a circular form like a rosary. Such linkages include Bricard6R and Bennett4R. To design such a closed linkage, it is necessary to solve a high-degree algebraic equation, which is generally difficult. In this lecture, the author proposes a new family of closed linkage mechanisms with an arbitrary number of hinges as an extension of a certain Bricard6R. They have singular properties, such as one-dimensional degree of freedom (1-DOF), and certain energies taking a constant value regardless of the state. These linkage mechanisms can be regarded as discrete M\\\"obius strips and may be of interest in the context of pure mathematics as well. However, many of the properties described here have been confirmed only numerically, with no rigorous mathematical proof, and should be interpreted with caution."

        "Abstract": "This article develops a Reinforcement Learning (RL) boundary controller of stop-and-go traffic congestion on a freeway segment. The traffic dynamics are governed by a macroscopic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model, consisting of $2\\times 2$ nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for traffic density and velocity. The boundary actuation of traffic flow is implemented with ramp-metering, which is a common approach to freeway congestion management. We use a discretized ARZ PDE model to describe the macroscopic freeway traffic environment for a stretch of freeway, and apply deep RL to develop continuous control on the outlet boundary. The control objective is to achieve $L^2$ norm regulation of the traffic state to a spatially uniform density and velocity. A recently developed neural network based policy gradient algorithm is employed, called proximal policy optimization. For comparison, we also consider an open-loop controller and a PDE backstepping approach. The backstepping controller is a model-based approach recently developed by the co-authors. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the RL approach nearly recovers the control performance of the model-based PDE backstepping approach, despite no \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the traffic flow dynamics."

        "Abstract": "We introduce and study the notion of k-divisible elements in a non-commutative probability space. A k-divisible element is a (non-commutative) random variable whose n-th moment vanishes whenever n is not a multiple of k. First, we consider the combinatorial convolution \\ast in the lattices NC of non-crossing partitions and NC^k of k-divisible non-crossing partitions and show that convolving k times with the zeta-function in NC is equivalent to convolving once with the zeta-function in NC^k. Furthermore, when x is k-divisible, we derive a formula for the free cumulants of x^k in terms of the free cumulants of x, involving k-divisible non-crossing partitions. Second, we prove that if a and s are free and s is k-divisible then sps and a are free, whenever p is any polynomial (on a and s) of degree k - 2 on s. Moreover, we define a notion of R-diagonal k-tuples and prove similar results. Next, we show that free multiplicative convolution between a measure concentrated in the positive real line and a probability measure with k-symmetry is well defined. Analytic tools to calculate this convolution are developed. Finally, we concentrate on free additive powers of k-symmetric distributions and prove that \\mu t is a well defined probability measure, for all t > 1. We derive central limit theorems and Poisson type ones. More generally, we consider freely infinitely divisible measures and prove that free infinite divisibility is maintained under the mapping \\mu \\rightarrow \\mu^k . We conclude by focusing on (k-symmetric) free stable distributions, for which we prove a reproducing property generalizing the ones known for one sided and real symmetric free stable laws."

Unlike previous efforts in the field, that fit only the parameters to the fixed functional forms, we instead use a novel algorithm to search the space of many possible functional forms. While a follow-on practical procedure will use experimental and {\\it ab inito} data to find an optimal functional form for a forcefield, we first validate the approach using a manufactured solution. This validation has the advantage of a well-defined metric of success. We manufactured a training set of atomic coordinate data with an associated set of global energies using the well-known Lennard-Jones inter-atomic potential. We performed an automatic functional form fitting procedure starting with a population of random functions, using a genetic programming functional formulation, and a parallel tempering Metropolis-based optimization algorithm. Our massively-parallel method independently discovered the Lennard-Jones function after searching for several hours on 100 processors and covering a miniscule portion of the configuration space. We find that the method is suitable for unsupervised discovery of functional forms for inter-atomic potentials/force-fields. We also find that our parallel tempering Metropolis-based approach significantly improves the optimization convergence time, and takes good advantage of the parallel cluster architecture."

        "Abstract": "In the real world, experimental data are rarely, if ever, distributed as a normal (Gaussian) distribution. As an example, a large set of data--such as the cross sections for particle scattering as a function of energy contained in the archives of the Particle Data Group--is a compendium of all published data, and hence, unscreened. Inspection of similar data sets quickly shows that, for many reasons, these data sets have many outliers--points well beyond what is expected from a normal distribution--thus ruling out the use of conventional $\\chi^2$ techniques. This note suggests an adaptive algorithm that allows a phenomenologist to apply to the data sample a sieve whose mesh is coarse enough to let the background fall through, but fine enough to retain the preponderance of the signal, thus sifting the data. A prescription is given for finding a robust estimate of the best-fit model parameters in the presence of a noisy background, together with a robust estimate of the model parameter errors, as well as a determination of the goodness-of-fit of the data to the theoretical hypothesis. Extensive computer simulations are carried out to test the algorithm for both its accuracy and stability under varying background conditions."

We study electric and magnetic fields with three possible orientations: radial (R), longitudinal (L) and azimuthal (A), and try to find solitonic stringlike solutions, having a regular axis and a flat metric at large $r$, with a possible angular defect. Assuming the function $\\Phi(F)$ to be regular at small $F$, it is shown that a regular axis is impossible in R-fields if there is a nonzero effective electric charge and in A-fields if there is a nonzero effective electric current along the axis. Solitonic solutions are only possible for purely magnetic R-fields and purely electric A-fields, in cases when $\\Phi(F)$ tends to a finite limit at large $F$. For both R- and A-fields, the desired large $r$ asymptotic is only possible with a non- Maxwell behaviour of $\\Phi(F)$ at small $F$. For L-fields, solutions with a regular axis are easily obtained (and can be found by quadratures) whereas a desired large $r$ asymptotic is only possible in an exceptional solution; the latter gives rise to solitonic configurations in case $\\Phi(F) = \\const \\cdot \\sqrt{F}$.

The model describes the time evolution of 1D quantum particle in a time-varying potential and also applies to propagation of electromagnetic waves in two dimensions within the parabolic approximation. We present a closed form solution for propagation in a uniform system. Motivated by recent studies of non-unitary directed models for localized 2D electrons tunneling in a magnetic field, we then address related theoretical questions of how the interference pattern between constrained-forward paths in this unitary model is affected by the addition of phases corresponding to such a magnetic field. The behavior is found to depend sensitively on the value of $\\Phi/\\Phi_{0}$, where $\\Phi$ is flux per plaquette and $\\Phi_{0}$ is the unit of flux quantum. For $\\Phi/\\Phi_{0} = p/q$ we find the amplitude to be more collimated the larger is the value of $q$. We next consider propagation in a random forward scattering media. In particular the scaling properties associated with the transverse width $x$ of the wave, as function of its distance $t$ from point source, are addressed. We find the moments of $x$ to scale with $t$ in a very different way from what is known for either off-lattice unitary or on-lattice non-unitary systems. The scaling of the moments of the probability $[P^{n}(x,t)]$ (or intensity) at a point $(x=0,t)$ is found to be consistent with a simple behavior $[P^{n}(0,t)] \\sim t^{-\\frac{n}{2}}$.

For different values of the rotation angle, we observe that such a coin leads to a variety of probability distributions, e.g. localized, periodic, classical-like, semi-classical-like, and quantum-like. Further, we study the Shannon entropy associated with position space and coin space of a quantum particle and compare it with the case of the position-independent coin. We show that the entropy is smaller for most values of the rotation angle as compared to the case of the position-independent coin. We also study the effect of entanglement on the behavior of probability distribution and Shannon entropy of a quantum walk by considering two identical position-dependent entangled coins. We observe that in general, a quantum particle becomes more localized as compared to the case of the position-independent coin and hence the corresponding Shannon entropy is minimum. Our results show that position-dependent coin can be used as a controlling tool of quantum walks."

Following Bacry and Kihlberg a four-dimensional internal spin space $\\bar S$ is chosen possessing an invariant measure and being able to represent integer as well as half integer spins. $\\bar S$ is a homogeneous space of the group $SL(2, C)$ parametrized in terms of spinors $\\a\\in C_2$ and their complex conjugates $\\bar\\a$. The generalized scalar quantum mechanical wave functions may be reduced to yield irreducible components of definite physical mass and spin $[m,s]$, with $m\\ge 0$ and $s=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 ...$, with spin described in terms of the usual $(2s+1)$-component fields. Viewed from the internal space description of spin this reduction amounts to a restriction of the variable $\\a$ to a compact subspace of $\\bar S$, i.e. a ``spin shell'' $S^2_{r=2s}$ of radius $r=2s$ in $ C_2$. This formulation of single particles or single antiparticles of type $[m,s]$ is then used to study the geometro- stochastic (i.e. quantum) propagation of amplitudes for arbitrary spin on a curved background space-time possessing a metric and axial vector torsion treated as external fields. A Poincar\\'e gauge covariant path integral-like representation for the probability amplitude (generalized wave function) of a particle with arbitrary spin is derived satisfying a second order wave equation on the Hilbert bundle constructed over curved space-time. The implications for the stochastic nature of polarization effects in the presence of gravitation are pointed out and the extension to Fock bundles of bosonic and fermionic type is briefly mentioned."

An example for this is the symplectic form of a magnetic monopole. A criterion for the removability of singularities is given in terms of regularizing functions for pure spinors. All removable singularities are poles in the sense that the norm of $\\omega$ is not locally bounded. The points at which removable singularities occur are the non-regular points of the Dirac structure for which we prove a general splitting theorem: Locally, every Dirac structure is the gauge transform of the product of a tangent bundle and the graph of a Poisson structure. This implies that in a neighborhood of a removable singularity $\\omega$ can be split into a non-singular presymplectic form and a singular presymplectic form which is the partial inverse of a Poisson bivector that vanishes at the singularity. An interesting class of examples is given by log-Dirac structures which generalize log-symplectic structures. The analogous notion of removable singularities of Poisson structures is also studied."

        "Abstract": "The genesis of spheroids is central to our understanding of galaxy formation -- they are relatively simple systems, containing about half the stellar mass of the Universe. A major subset of spheroids, massive elliptical galaxies, are preferentially found in clusters where they exhibit old, coeval stellar populations suggesting that they formed synchronously at early epochs. Here we report SCUBA submillimeter imaging of a region around a z=1.8 X-ray selected QSO. The image reveals a remarkable 400 kiloparsec long chain of galaxies each with an obscured star-formation rate sufficiently high to build a massive spheroid in less than 1 Gyr. The large over-density of these galaxies relative to expectations for a random field implies they probably reside in a structure associated with the QSO. We suggest that this star formation is associated with galaxy mergers or encounters within the filament, such as those predicted by the popular hierarchical model of galaxy formation. Our observations suggest that strong absorption in the X-ray spectra of QSOs at high-redshifts may result from a veil of gas thrown up by a merger or merger-induced activity, rather than an orientation-dependent obscuring torus. It is argued that these systems are the precursors of elliptical galaxies found today in the core regions of all rich galaxy clusters."

On the one hand, the quasi-1D structure of the Fermi surface strongly favors the formation of a non-uniform state (Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state) in the presence of a magnetic field acting on the electron spins. On the other hand, a magnetic field acting on an open Fermi surface induces a dimensional crossover by confining the electronic wave-functions wave-functions along the chains of highest conductivity, which results in a divergence of the orbital critical field and in a stabilization at low temperature of a cascade of superconducting phases separated by first order transistions. In this paper, we study the phase diagram as a function of the anisotropy. We discuss in details the experimental situation in the quasi-1D organic conductors of the Bechgaard salts family and argue that they appear as good candidates for the observation of the LOFF state, provided that their anisotropy is large enough. Recent experiments on the organic quasi-1D superconductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ are in agreement with the results obtained in this paper and could be interpreted as a signature of a high-field superconducting phase. We also point out the possibility to observe a LOFF state in some quasi-2D organic superconductors."

Surprisingly, many key theoretical predictions for this ultra-relativistic regime have yet to be tested in a laboratory. Graphene, a 2D material in which electrons behave like massless Dirac fermions, provides a unique opportunity to experimentally test such predictions. The response of Dirac fermions to a Coulomb potential in graphene is central to a wide range of electronic phenomena and can serve as a sensitive probe of graphene's intrinsic dielectric constant, the primary factor determining the strength of electron-electron interactions in this material. Here we present a direct measurement of the nanoscale response of Dirac fermions to a single Coulomb potential placed on a gated graphene device. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy were used to fabricate tunable charge impurities on graphene and to measure how they are screened by Dirac fermions for a Q = +1|e| impurity charge state. Electron-like and hole-like Dirac fermions were observed to respond very differently to tunable Coulomb potentials. Comparison of this electron-hole asymmetry to theoretical simulations has allowed us to test basic predictions for the behavior of Dirac fermions near a Coulomb potential and to extract the intrinsic dielectric constant of graphene: {\\epsilon}_g= 3.0 \\pm 1.0. This small value of {\\epsilon}_g indicates that microscopic electron-electron interactions can contribute significantly to graphene properties."

The most natural mechanism by which the SMNS can lose its rotational energy is through a strong pulsar type wind, between the supernova and the GRB events, which is expected to create a PWB. We analyze in some detail the observational implications of such a plerionic environment on the afterglow (AG) and prompt GRB emissions, and the prospect for direct detection of the plerion emission. We find that for a simple spherical model, GRBs with iron lines detected in the X-ray AG should not have a detectable radio afterglow, and should have small jet break times and non-relativistic transition times, in disagreement with observations for some of the GRBs with X-ray lines. These discrepancies with the observations may be reconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry, where the PWB is elongated along the polar axis. We find that lack of detection of the plerion emission provides interesting constraints on the model parameters. Finally, we predict that the inverse Compton upscattering of the PWB photons by the relativistic electrons of the AG (external Compton, EC) should lead to high energy emission during the early AG that might explain the GeV photons detected by EGRET for a few GRBs, and should be detectable by future missions such as GLAST."

The scheduling counting function counts the number of solutions to $S$. We prove that this counting function is a polynomial in the number of time slots allowed. Scheduling polynomials include the chromatic polynomial of a graph, the zeta polynomial of a lattice, the Billera-Jia-Reiner polynomial of a matroid.   To any scheduling problem, we associate not only a counting function for solutions, but also a quasisymmetric function and a quasisymmetric function in non-commuting variables. These scheduling functions include the chromatic symmetric functions of Sagan, Gebhard, and Stanley, and a close variant of Ehrenborg's quasisymmetric function for posets.   Geometrically, we consider the space of all solutions to a given scheduling problem. We extend a result of Steingr\\'immson by proving that the $h$-vector of the space of solutions is given by a shift of the scheduling polynomial.

Thus, finding exceptional points in different quantum systems is vital for developing such future sensing devices. Taking advantage of the enhanced light-matter interactions in a confined volume on a metal nanoparticle surface, here we theoretically demonstrate the existence of exceptional points in a system consisting of quantum emitters coupled to a metal nanoparticle of subwavelength scale. By using an analytical quantum electrodynamics approach, exceptional points are manifested as a result of a strong coupling effect and observable in a drastic splitting of originally coalescent eigenenergies. Furthermore, we show that exceptional points can also occur when a number of quantum emitters is collectively coupled to the dipole mode of localized surface plasmons. Such a quantum collective effect not only relaxes the strong-coupling requirement for an individual emitter, but also results in a more stable generation of the exceptional points. Finally, we point out that the exceptional points can be explicitly shown in the transmission spectrum of an ancilla waveguide coupled to the system."

A hyperplane $\\Hy$ is an \\emph{$m$-separator} for $\\D$ if each closed halfspace bounded by $\\Hy$ contains at least $m$ points from $P$. This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond to $n/2$-separators. The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied. Separators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer schemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating hyperplane may still interact with both sides of the partition. Therefore it is desirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls only. We present three deterministic algorithms to bisect or approximately bisect a given set of disjoint unit balls by a hyperplane: Firstly, we present a simple linear-time algorithm to construct an $\\alpha n$-separator for balls in $\\R^d$, for any $0<\\alpha<1/2$, that intersects at most $cn^{(d-1)/d}$ balls, for some constant $c$ that depends on $d$ and $\\alpha$.

        "Abstract": "States of a quantum mechanical system are represented by rays in a complex Hilbert space. The space of rays has, naturally, the structure of a K\\\"ahler manifold. This leads to a geometrical formulation of the postulates of quantum mechanics which, although equivalent to the standard algebraic formulation, has a very different appearance. In particular, states are now represented by points of a symplectic manifold (which happens to have, in addition, a compatible Riemannian metric), observables are represented by certain real-valued functions on this space and the Schr\\\"odinger evolution is captured by the symplectic flow generated by a Hamiltonian function. There is thus a remarkable similarity with the standard symplectic formulation of classical mechanics. Features---such as uncertainties and state vector reductions---which are specific to quantum mechanics can also be formulated geometrically but now refer to the Riemannian metric---a structure which is absent in classical mechanics. The geometrical formulation sheds considerable light on a number of issues such as the second quantization procedure, the role of coherent states in semi-classical considerations and the WKB approximation. More importantly, it suggests generalizations of quantum mechanics. The simplest among these are equivalent to the dynamical generalizations that have appeared in the literature. The geometrical reformulation provides a unified framework to discuss these and to correct a misconception. Finally, it also suggests directions in which more radical generalizations may be found."

Partial $k$-colorability is a more robust structural property of a graph than $k$-colorability. For graphs that arise in practice, partial $k$-colorability might be a better notion to use than $k$-colorability, since data arising in practice often contains various forms of noise.   We give a polynomial time algorithm that takes as input a $(1 - \\epsilon)$-partially $3$-colorable graph $G$ and a constant $\\gamma \\in [\\epsilon, 1/10]$, and colors a $(1 - \\epsilon/\\gamma)$ fraction of the vertices using $\\tilde{O}\\left(n^{0.25 + O(\\gamma^{1/2})} \\right)$ colors.

The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

The system comprises two high-surface brightness arcs with a maximum extent of 3\", bracketing a central object which we identify as a massive early-type galaxy at z=0.73. We construct a lens model which reproduces the main features of the system using a combination of a galaxy-scale lens and the foreground cluster. We show that the morphological, spectral and photometric properties of the arcs are consistent with them arising from the lensing of a single ~L* LBG. The most important feature of this system is that the lensing magnification results in an apparent magnitude of r=20.3, making this one of the brightest LBGs known. Such a high magnification provides the opportunity of obtaining very high signal to noise (and potentially spatially resolved) spectroscopy of a high redshift galaxy to study its physical properties. We present initial imaging and spectroscopy demonstrating the basic properties of the system and discuss the opportunities for future observations."

        "Title": "Algorithms for Discrete Denoising Under Channel Uncertainty",
        "Abstract": "The goal of a denoising algorithm is to reconstruct a signal from its noise-corrupted observations. Perfect reconstruction is seldom possible and performance is measured under a given fidelity criterion. In a recent work, the authors addressed the problem of denoising unknown discrete signals corrupted by a discrete memoryless channel when the channel, rather than being completely known, is only known to lie in some uncertainty set of possible channels. A sequence of denoisers was derived for this case and shown to be asymptotically optimal with respect to a worst-case criterion argued most relevant to this setting. In the present work we address the implementation and complexity of this denoiser for channels parametrized by a scalar, establishing its practicality. We show that for symmetric channels, the problem can be mapped into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. We also present empirical results suggesting the potential of these schemes to do well in practice. A key component of our schemes is an estimator of the subset of channels in the uncertainty set that are feasible in the sense of being able to give rise to the noise-corrupted signal statistics for some channel input distribution. We establish the efficiency of this estimator, both algorithmically and experimentally. We also present a modification of the recently developed discrete universal denoiser (DUDE) that assumes a channel based on the said estimator, and show that, in practice, the resulting scheme performs well. For concreteness, we focus on the binary alphabet case and binary symmetric channels, but also discuss the extensions of the algorithms to general finite alphabets and to general channels parameterized by a scalar."

        "Abstract": "In case of spacetimes with single horizon, there exist several well-established procedures for relating the surface gravity of the horizon to a thermodynamic temperature. Such procedures, however, cannot be extended in a straightforward manner when a spacetime has multiple horizons. In particular, it is not clear whether there exists a notion of global temperature characterizing the multi-horizon spacetimes. We examine the conditions under which a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using the example of Schwarzschild-De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically extend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor, response of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for identifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the SDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart which covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a consistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS spacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two temperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS spacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational (c) Even when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal nature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate chart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other charts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures. The coordinate dependence of the thermal nature is reminiscent of the flat spacetime in Minkowski and Rindler coordinate charts. The implications are discussed."

        "Abstract": "Cancer stem cells have been shown to be critical to the development of a variety of solid cancers. The precise interplay mechanisms between cancer stem cells and the rest of a tissue are still not elucidated. To shed light on the interactions between stem and non-stem cancer cell populations we develop a two-population mathematical model, which is suitable to describe tumorsphere growth. Both interspecific and intraspecific interactions, mediated by the microenvironment, are included. We show that there is a tipping point, characterized by a transcritical bifurcation, where a purely non-stem cell attractor is replaced by a new attractor that contains both stem and differentiated cancer cells. The model is then applied to describe the outcome of a recent experiment. This description reveals that, while the intraspecific interactions are inhibitory, the interspecific interactions stimulate growth. This can be understood in terms of stem cells needing differentiated cells to reinforce their niches, and phenotypic plasticity favoring the de-differentiation of differentiated cells into cancer stem cells. We posit that this is a consequence of the deregulation of the quorum sensing that maintains homeostasis in healthy tissues."

In this work, we consider a function that given a path returns the supremum value of the window mean-payoff that can be ensured over the path and we show how to compute its expected value in Markov chains and Markov decision processes. We consider two variants of the function: Fixed window mean-payoff in which a fixed window length $l_{max}$ is provided; and Bounded window mean-payoff in which we compute the maximum possible value of the window mean-payoff over all possible window lengths. Further, for both variants, we consider (i) a direct version of the problem where for each path, the payoff that can be ensured from its very beginning and (ii) a non-direct version that is the prefix independent counterpart of the direct version of the problem."

        "Abstract": "The injection of a fluid into a material causes a spatiotemporal pattern to form along the injection front. This process is relevant in the case of oil recovery from soil. When the replaced material is a viscous fluid, it forms a finger-like pattern, known as viscous fingering. Interestingly, most replaced materials are, in reality, viscoelastic, i.e., they behave as an elastic solid over short timescales but flow as a viscous liquid over longer timescales. Therefore, it is important to study the scenario in which the replaced material is a viscoelastic fluid. In this study, we observe the appearance of delamination-induced fingering when an incompressible organic fluid is injected into an oleophilic Hele--Shaw cell filled with an aqueous viscoelastic fluid composed of a wormlike micellar solution. We find a transition in the injection pattern: during the injection, the thick fingering pattern of the interface near the inlet changes to thin fingers with a characteristic size of four times the cell thickness. We examine the material properties, and conclude that the fingering pattern observed at later times is caused by the delamination of viscoelastic fluid from the substrate."

The neighborhood sampling used in GraphSAGE is effective in order to improve computing and memory efficiency when inferring a batch of target nodes with diverse degrees in parallel. Despite this advantage, the default uniform sampling suffers from high variance in training and inference, leading to sub-optimum accuracy. We propose a new data-driven sampling approach to reason about the real-valued importance of a neighborhood by a non-linear regressor, and to use the value as a criterion for subsampling neighborhoods. The regressor is learned using a value-based reinforcement learning. The implied importance for each combination of vertex and neighborhood is inductively extracted from the negative classification loss output of GraphSAGE. As a result, in an inductive node classification benchmark using three datasets, our method enhanced the baseline using the uniform sampling, outperforming recent variants of a graph neural network in accuracy."

These problems are centered on the problematic relation between the quantum and classical worlds. The most famous element is the measurement problem, i.e., the measurement of a quantum system by a classical apparatus, and the concomitant phenomena of wave packet reduction, the appearance of probability, and the problems related to Schr\\\"odinger cat states. A fundamental question in this context is whether quantum mechanics can bootstrap itself to the classical world: is quantum mechanics self-consistent, such that the measurement process can be understood within quantum mechanics itself, or does this process require additional elements from the realm outside of traditional quantum mechanics? Here, we point to a problematic aspect in the traditional Schr\\\"odinger cat argument which can be overcome through its extension with a proper macroscopic preparation device; the deliberate creation of a cat state and its identification then turns into a non-trivial problem requiring the determination of the evolution of a quantum system entangled with a macroscopic reservoir. We describe a new type of wave-function correlator testing for the appearance of Schr\\\"odinger cat states and discuss its implications for theories deriving the wave function collapse from a unitary evolution."

        "Abstract": "The classical numerical treatment of boundary value problems defined on infinite intervals is to replace the boundary conditions at infinity by suitable boundary conditions at a finite point, the so-called truncated boundary. A truncated boundary allowing for a satisfactory accuracy of the numerical solution has to be determined by trial and errors and this seems to be the weakest point of the classical approach. On the other hand, the free boundary approach overcomes the need for a priori definition of the truncated boundary. In fact, in a free boundary formulation the unknown free boundary can be identified with a truncated boundary and being unknown it has to be found as part of the solution. In this paper we consider a different way to overcome the introduction of a truncated boundary, namely finite differences schemes defined on quasi-uniform grids. A quasi-uniform grid allows us to describe the infinite domain by a finite number of intervals. The last node of such grid is placed on infinity so right boundary conditions are taken into account exactly. We apply the proposed approach to the Falkner-Skan model and to a problem of interest in foundation engineering. The obtained numerical results are found in good agreement with those available in literature. Moreover, we provide a simple way to improve the accuracy of the numerical results using Richardson's extrapolation. Finally, we indicate a possible way to extend the proposed approach to boundary value problems defined on the whole real line."

        "Abstract": "We present a deep X-ray observation of the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in NGC4258 (M106) using ASCA. The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

Stimulated Brillouin scattering, which was recently demonstrated in silicon, is a particularly powerful approach to induce a phase shift due to its inherent flexibility, offering an optically controllable and selective phase shift. However, to date, only moderate amounts of Brillouin gain has been achieved and theoretically this would restrict the phase shift to a few tens of degrees, significantly less than the required 360 degrees. Here, we overcome this limitation with a phase enhancement method using RF interference, showing a 360 degrees broadband phase shifter based on Brillouin scattering in a suspended silicon waveguide. We achieve a full 360 degrees phase-shift over a bandwidth of 15 GHz using a phase enhancement factor of 25, thereby enabling practical broadband Brillouin phase shifter for beam forming and other applications."

Using a very simple model with bottom-up majority rule voting, the dynamics of power distribution at the various hierarchical levels is calculated within a probabilistic framework. Given a leadership at the top, the opposition weight from the hierarchy bottom is shown to fall off quickly while climbing up the hierarchy. It reaches zero after only a few hierarchical levels. Indeed the voting process is found to obey a threshold dynamics with a deterministic top outcome. Accordingly the leadership may stay stable against very large amplitude increases in the opposition at the bottom level. An opposition can thus grow steadily from few percent up to seventy seven percent with not one a single change at the elected top level. However and in contrast, from one election to another, in the vicinity of the threshold, less than a one percent additional shift at the bottom level can drive a drastic and brutal change at the top. The opposition topples the current leadership at once. In addition to analytical formulas, results from a large scale simulation are presented. The results may shed a new light on management architectures as well as on alert systems. They could also provide some different insight on last century's Eastern European communist collapse."

With a peak absolute R magnitude of -12 this event is distinctly brighter than novae, but fainter than type Ia supernovae (expected from a population of old stars in lenticular galaxies). Archival images of the field do not show a luminous star at that position with an upper limit of ~-4.1, so it is unlikely to be a giant eruption from a luminous blue variable star. Over a two month period the transient emitted radiation energy of almost 10E47 erg and subsequently faded in the opical sky. It is similar to, but more luminous at peak by a factor of 6 than, an enigmatic transient in the galaxy M31. A possible origin of M85 OT2006-1 is a stellar merger.

        "Title": "Stability of leadership in bottom-up hierarchical organizations",
        "Abstract": "The stability of a leadership against a growing internal opposition is studied in bottom-up hierarchical organizations. Using a very simple model with bottom-up majority rule voting, the dynamics of power distribution at the various hierarchical levels is calculated within a probabilistic framework. Given a leadership at the top, the opposition weight from the hierarchy bottom is shown to fall off quickly while climbing up the hierarchy. It reaches zero after only a few hierarchical levels. Indeed the voting process is found to obey a threshold dynamics with a deterministic top outcome. Accordingly the leadership may stay stable against very large amplitude increases in the opposition at the bottom level. An opposition can thus grow steadily from few percent up to seventy seven percent with not one a single change at the elected top level. However and in contrast, from one election to another, in the vicinity of the threshold, less than a one percent additional shift at the bottom level can drive a drastic and brutal change at the top. The opposition topples the current leadership at once. In addition to analytical formulas, results from a large scale simulation are presented. The results may shed a new light on management architectures as well as on alert systems. They could also provide some different insight on last century's Eastern European communist collapse."

        "Abstract": "We are pursuing a modeling methodology that views the world as a realm of things. A thing is defined as something that can be created, processed, released, transferred, and received. Additionally, in this modeling approach, a thing is a five-dimensional structure referred to as a thinging (abstract) machine. On the other hand, machines are things that are operated on; that is, they are created, processed, released, transferred, and received. The intertwining with the world is accomplished by integrating these two modes of an entity s being: being a thing that flows through machines and being a machine that processes things. This paper further enriches these notions of things and machines. We present further exploration of the thinging machine model through introducing a new notion called the thing/machine (thimac) as a label of the unity of things/machines. Thimacs replace traditional categorization, properties, and behavior with creating, processing, releasing, transferring, and receiving, as well as the two linking notions of flow and triggering. The paper discusses the concept of thimacs with examples and focuses on the notion of structure as it applies to various diagrammatic modeling methodologies."

Given Phase II study results or prior knowledge, it is usually of main interest to find the optimal graph that maximizes a certain objective function in a future Phase III study. However, lack of a closed form expression in the objective function makes the optimization challenging. In this manuscript, we propose a general optimization framework to obtain the global maximum via feedforward neural networks (FNNs) in deep learning. Simulation studies show that our FNN-based approach has a better balance between robustness and time efficiency than some existing derivative-free constrained optimization algorithms. Compared to the traditional window searching approach, our optimizer has moderate multiplicity adjusted power gain when the number of hypotheses is relatively large or when their correlations are high. We further apply it to a case study to illustrate how to optimize a multiple test procedure with respect to a specific study objective."

Giving quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases, it is a candidate for a unified physical theory. The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the so-called causal action principle. The causal action principle does not rely on a presupposed space-time structure. Instead, it is a variational principle for space-time itself as well as for all structures in space-time (like particles, fields, etc.).   After a general motivation and introduction, we report on mathematical results for two-particle causal fermion systems which state that every minimizer describes a discrete space-time. We explain and make precise that on scales which are much larger than the scale of the microscopic space-time structures, the dynamics of a causal fermion system respects causality with a finite speed of propagation."

For $p=2^*-1$, this equivalence leads us to a Brezis--Nirenberg type problem, cf. \\cite{BN}, but, in our particular case, the linear term is a nonlocal term. The effect that this nonlocal term has on the equation changes the dimensions for which the classical technique based on the minimizers of the Sobolev constant ensures the existence of solution, going from dimensions $N\\geq 4$ in the classical Brezis-Nirenberg problem, to dimensions $N\\geq7$ for this nonlocal problem."

        "Abstract": "When a deep neural network is trained on data with only image-level labeling, the regions activated in each image tend to identify only a small region of the target object. We propose a method of using videos automatically harvested from the web to identify a larger region of the target object by using temporal information, which is not present in the static image. The temporal variations in a video allow different regions of the target object to be activated. We obtain an activated region in each frame of a video, and then aggregate the regions from successive frames into a single image, using a warping technique based on optical flow. The resulting localization maps cover more of the target object, and can then be used as proxy ground-truth to train a segmentation network. This simple approach outperforms existing methods under the same level of supervision, and even approaches relying on extra annotations. Based on VGG-16 and ResNet 101 backbones, our method achieves the mIoU of 65.0 and 67.4, respectively, on PASCAL VOC 2012 test images, which represents a new state-of-the-art."

The deepest optical spectrum does not reveal any absorption line from a donor star. Our aim was to measure the radial velocity curve and estimate the parameters of the binary system. We find an upper limit on the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity of K=132\\pm42 km/s. A search for a periodic signal in the data resulted in no statistically significant period. The mass function and constraints on the binary system imply a black hole mass of less than ~510 M_sun. Whilst, a disc irradiation model may imply a black hole mass smaller than ~431-1985 M_sun, depending on inclination. Our data can also be consistent with an unexplored orbital period range from a couple of hours to a few days, thus with a stellar-mass black hole and a subgiant companion."

Here we propose a magnetic photogalvanic effect that couples the magnetism to the light-matter interaction. This phenomenon emerges from the $\\mathbf{k}$ to $\\mathbf{-k}$ symmetry-breaking in the band structure and does not require a static polarization. It is distinct from other known bulk photovoltaic mechanisms such as the shift current. We demonstrate such phenomena in a newly discovered layered magnetic insulator CrI$_3$. A record photoconductivity response (more than 200 $\\mu A V^{-2} $) is generated under the irradiation of a visible light in the antiferromagnetic phase. The current can be reversed and switched by controllable magnetic phase transitions.

Ground manifold of the polar centers includes three terms $^{1}A_{1g}$ (Zhang-Rice singlet), $^{1}E_{u}$, $^{3}E_{u}$ with different spin multiplicity, orbital degeneracy and parity that provides an unconventional multi-mode behaviour of the cuprates. The spin subsystem of the copper oxides within the polar Jahn-Teller $CuO_{4}$ centers model is a two-component spin liquid and corresponds to a singlet-triplet magnet with possible noncollinear spin configurations. In the framework of a modified mean field approximation some kinds of spin ordering are discussed including as a trivial singlet or triplet states as a pure quantum singlet-triplet mixed state. A local boson movement is accompanied by a modulation of the spin density on the site resulting in the so called induced spin fluctuations. Some unconventional features of the induced spin fluctuations are considered including an appearance of the induced longitudinal ferrimagnetism with an appropriate contribution to the spin susceptibility, a possibility to observe and examine the charge fluctuations with the help of the traditional magnetic methods such as the magnetic inelastic neutron scattering and the spin lattice relaxation experiments. The suggested model, in comparison with the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi-liquid model, represents new approach to the description of the spin system of the high-$T_c$ cuprates."

The map is embedded into a continuous unitary transformation generated by a time-independent quasi-Hamiltonian. Such a Hamiltonian generates at the very point of the resonance a local gauge transformation described the unitary unimodular group SU(q). The resonant energy growth of is attributed to the zero Liouville eigenmodes of the generator in the adjoint representation of the group while the non-zero modes yield saturating with time contribution. In a vicinity of a given resonance, the quasi-Hamiltonian is then found in the form of power expansion with respect to the detuning from the resonance. The problem is related in this way to the motion along a circle in a (q^2-1)-component inhomogeneous \"magnetic\" field of a quantum particle with $q$ intrinsic degrees of freedom described by the SU(q) group. This motion is in parallel with the classical phase oscillations near a non-linear resonance. The most important role is played by the resonances with the orders much smaller than the typical localization length, q << l. Such resonances master for exponentially long though finite times the motion in some domains around them. Explicit analytical solution is possible for a few lowest and strongest resonances."

The estimated temperature of the cluster is kT = 2.45 keV and the central electron density is no~7.8 x 10^(-3) cm^(-3) which reveals a hot, dense environment in which Hercules A is situated.

For the wave vector $k_{x}$ within the first Brillouin zone, the EMPs show as the regions of acoustical or quasi-acoustical dispersion, with a finite value of group velocity, so the regions with frequency gaps, where a group velocity is nullified at some $k_{x}$. We obtain that for $k_{x} \\to 0$ only for two EMPs the frequency tends to zero as for other EMPs it obtains finite values. Strong dependence of dispersion relations of the EMPs from the period of the superlattice $a_{0}$ and the distance $d$ from a metallic gate is shown; in particular, for typical size of a gap, for characteristic value of the frequency and $k_{x}$ at which the group velocity is reduced to zero.

Those features allowed us to characterize field emission for macroscopic electric fields up to 250 V/$\\mu$m and attain current densities larger than 10$^5$ A/cm$^2$. FE behaviour is analyzed in the framework of the Fowler-Nordheim theory. A field enhancement factor $\\gamma \\approx$ 40-50 and a turn-on field $E_{turn-on} \\sim$15 V/$\\mu$m at an inter-electrode distance of 1 $\\mu$m are estimated. Current saturation observed at high voltages in the I-V characteristics is explained in terms of a series resistance of the order of M$\\Omega$. Additional effects as electrical conditioning, CNT degradation, response to laser irradiation and time stability are investigated and discussed."

        "Title": "CvxNets: Learnable Convex Decomposition",
        "Abstract": "Any solid object can be decomposed into a collection of convex polytopes (in short, convexes). When a small number of convexes are used, such a decomposition can be thought of as a piece-wise approximation of the geometry. This decomposition is fundamental to real-time physics simulation in computer graphics, where it creates a unifying representation of dynamic geometry for collision detection. A convex object also has the property of being simultaneously an explicit and implicit representation: one can interpret it explicitly as a mesh derived by computing the vertices of a convex hull, or implicitly as the collection of half-space constraints or support functions. Their implicit representation makes them particularly well suited for neural network training, as they abstract away from the topology of the geometry they need to represent. We introduce a network architecture to represent a low dimensional family of convexes. This family is automatically derived via an autoencoding process. We investigate the applications of the network including automatic convex decomposition, image to 3D reconstruction, and part-based shape retrieval."

        "Title": "Few-Shot Adversarial Learning of Realistic Neural Talking Head Models",
        "Abstract": "Several recent works have shown how highly realistic human head images can be obtained by training convolutional neural networks to generate them. In order to create a personalized talking head model, these works require training on a large dataset of images of a single person. However, in many practical scenarios, such personalized talking head models need to be learned from a few image views of a person, potentially even a single image. Here, we present a system with such few-shot capability. It performs lengthy meta-learning on a large dataset of videos, and after that is able to frame few- and one-shot learning of neural talking head models of previously unseen people as adversarial training problems with high capacity generators and discriminators. Crucially, the system is able to initialize the parameters of both the generator and the discriminator in a person-specific way, so that training can be based on just a few images and done quickly, despite the need to tune tens of millions of parameters. We show that such an approach is able to learn highly realistic and personalized talking head models of new people and even portrait paintings."

Tunneling fixed points are a subset of `termination' fixed points, which describe boundary conditions on a multicomponent edge. The requirement of unitary time evolution at the boundary gives a nontrivial consistency condition for possible low-energy boundary conditions. The effect of interactions and random hopping on fixed points is studied through a perturbative RG approach which generalizes the Giamarchi-Schulz RG for disordered Luttinger liquids to broken left-right symmetry and multiple modes. The allowed termination points of a multicomponent edge are classified by a B-matrix with rational matrix elements. We apply our approach to a number of examples, such as tunneling between a quantum Hall edge and a superconductor and tunneling between two quantum Hall edges in the presence of interactions. Interactions are shown to induce a continuous renormalization of effective tunneling charge for the integrable case of tunneling between two Laughlin states. The correlation functions of electronlike operators across a junction are found from the B matrix using a simple image-charge description, along with the induced lattice of boundary operators.

        "Abstract": "We have searched for a methane signature in the infrared spectrum of tau Bootis, produced by the planetary companion. The observations comprise 598 low-noise, high resolution spectra near 3.28 microns, which we analyze by cross-correlating with a modeled planetary spectrum based on the work of Burrows and Sharp (1999), and Sudarsky et al. (2000). The 3-sigma random noise level of our analysis is 0.00006 stellar continuum flux units, and the confusion noise limit - measuring the resemblence of a cross-correlation feature to the spectrum of methane - is 0.00025.   We find a significant cross-correlation amplitude of 0.00033 continuum units at a velocity near that of the star. This is likely due to methane from a low-mass companion in a long-period orbit. Fischer, Butler and Marcy (2000) report a long-term velocity drift indicative of such a companion. But the system is known to be a visual binary with an eccentric orbit, and is rapidly approaching periastron. Whether the visual companion can account for our observations and the Fischer et al. velocity drift depends on knowing the orbit more precisely. The stability of planetary orbits in this system also depends crucially on the properties of the binary orbit. A second cross-correlation feature, weaker and much more diffuse, has intensity amplitude 0.0002 continuum units and occurs at a velocity amplitude of 71 +/-10 km/sec, in agreement with the orbit claimed for the planet by Cameron et al. (1999). Like the first feature, it has passed several tests designed to reject systematic errors. We discuss the possibility that this second feature is due to the planet."

        "Abstract": "When two superconductors become electrically connected by a weak link a zero-resistance supercurrent can flow. This supercurrent is carried by Cooper pairs of electrons with a combined charge of twice the elementary charge, e. The 2e charge quantum is clearly visible in the height of Shapiro steps in Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation and in the magnetic flux periodicity of h/2e in superconducting quantum interference devices. Several different materials have been used to weakly couple superconductors, such as tunnel barriers, normal metals, or semiconductors. Here, we study supercurrents through a quantum dot created in a semiconductor nanowire by local electrostatic gating. Due to strong Coulomb interaction, electrons only tunnel one-by-one through the discrete energy levels of the quantum dot. This nevertheless can yield a supercurrent when subsequent tunnel events are coherent. These quantum coherent tunnelling processes can result in either a positive or a negative supercurrent, i.e. in a normal or a pi-junction, respectively. We demonstrate that the supercurrent reverses sign by adding a single electron spin to the quantum dot. When excited states of the quantum dot are involved in transport, the supercurrent sign also depends on the character of the orbital wavefunctions."

        "Abstract": "Recent images of the disks of dust around the young stars HR 4796A and Fomalhaut show, in each case, a double-lobed feature that may be asymmetric (one lobe may be brighter than the other). A symmetric double-lobed structure is that expected from a disk of dust with a central hole that is observed nearly edge-on (i.e., close to the plane of the disk). This paper shows how the gravitational influence of a second body in the system with an eccentric orbit would cause a brightness asymmetry in such a disk by imposing a \"forced eccentricity\" on the orbits of the constituent dust particles, thus shifting the center of symmetry of the disk away from the star and causing the dust near the forced pericenter of the perturbed disk to glow. Dynamic modeling of the HR 4796 disk shows that its 5% brightness asymmetry could be the result of a forced eccentricity as small as 0.02 imposed on the disk by either the binary companion HR 4796B, or by an unseen planet close to the inner edge of the disk. Since it is likely that a forced eccentricity of 0.01 or higher would be imposed on a disk in a system in which there are planets, but no binary companion, the corresponding asymmetry in the disk's structure could serve as a sensitive indicator of these planets that might otherwise remain undetected."

We assume, further, that the event horizon, $\\tn$, of the black hole is a Killing horizon with compact cross-sections. We prove that if surface gravity is non-zero constant throughout the horizon one can {\\it globally} extend such a spacetime so that the image of $\\cal N$ is a proper subset of a regular bifurcate Killing horizon in the enlarged spacetime. The necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the extendibility of matter fields to the enlarged spacetime. These conditions are automatically satisfied if the spacetime is static (and, hence ``$t$\"-reflection symmetric) or stationary-axisymmetric with ``$t-\\phi$\" reflection isometry and the matter fields respect the reflection isometry. In addition, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the constancy of the surface gravity on a Killing horizon is that the exterior derivative of the twist of the horizon Killing field vanish on the horizon. As a corollary of this, we recover a result of Carter that constancy of surface gravity holds for any black hole which is static or stationary- axisymmetric with the ``$t-\\phi$\" reflection isometry. No use of Einstein's equation is made in obtaining any of the above results. Taken together, these results support the view that any spacetime representing the asymptotic final state of a black hole formed by gravitational collapse may be assumed to possess a bifurcate Killing horizon or a Killing horizon with vanishing surface gravity."

Here we propose a method to enlarge a minute mechanical frequency shift, which is smaller than the linewidth of the mechanical oscillator, into a huge frequency shift of the normal mode. Explicitly, a frequency shift of about 20 Hz of the mechanical oscillator would be magnified to be a 1 MHz frequency shift in the normal mode, which increases it by five orders of magnitude. This enhancement relies on the sensitivity appearing near the quantum critical point of the electromechanical system. We show that a mechanical frequency shift of 1 Hz could be resolved with a mechanical resonance frequency $\\omega_b = 11\\times 2\\pi $ MHz. Namely, an ultrasensitive mechanical mass sensor of the resolution $\\Delta m /m \\sim2\\Delta \\omega_b/\\omega_b\\sim 10^{-8}$ could be achieved.

        "Abstract": "We summarize recent developments in the study of the origin of halo spin profiles and preliminary implications on disk formation. The specific angular-momentum distributions within halos in N-body simulations match a universal shape, M(<j) \\propto j/(j_0+j). It is characterized by a power law over most of the mass, and one shape parameter in addition to the spin parameter \\lambda. The angular momentum tends to be aligned throughout the halo and of cylindrical symmetry. Even if angular momentum is conserved during baryonic infall, the resultant disk density profile is predicted to deviate from exponential, with a denser core and an extended tail. A slightly corrected version of the scaling relation due to linear tidal-torque theory is used to explain the origin of a typical power-law profile in shells, j(M) \\propto M^s with s \\gsim 1. While linear theory crudely predicts the amplitudes of halo spins, it is not a good predictor of their directions. Independently, mergers of halos are found to produce a similar profile due to j transfer from the orbit to the product halo via dynamical friction and tidal stripping. The halo spin is correlated with having a recent major merger, though this correlation is weakened by mass loss. These two effects are due to a correlation between the spins of neighboring halos and their orbit, leading to prograde mergers."

We start with a root node containing all the particles and then recursively divide each node into two nodes each containing roughly equal number of particles,until each of the nodes contains only one particle. The volume of such a leaf node provides an estimate of the local density. We implement an entropy-based node splitting criterion that results in a significant improvement in the estimation of densities compared to earlier work. The method is completely metric free and can be applied to arbitrary number of dimensions. We apply this method to determine the phase space densities of dark matter halos obtained from cosmological N-body simulations. We find that contrary to earlier studies, the volume distribution function $v(f)$ of phase space density $f$ does not have a constant slope but rather a small hump at high phase space densities. We demonstrate that a model in which a halo is made up by a superposition of Hernquist spheres is not capable in explaining the shape of $v(f)$ vs $f$ relation, whereas a model which takes into account the contribution of the main halo separately roughly reproduces the behavior as seen in simulations. The use of the presented method is not limited to calculation of phase space densities, but can be used as a general-purpose data-mining tool and due to its speed and accuracy it is ideally suited for analysis of large multidimensional data sets."

The periodic driving, we employ here, is adiabatically switched on to break the particle-hole symmetry and generate a chiral mass term in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian; consequently the Floquet Hamiltonian also gets deformed without crossing the gapless critical point. The particle hole symmetry is subsequently restored in the Floquet Hamiltonian by adiabatically switching off a part of the periodic potential. Thereafter, the Floquet Hamiltonian develops a symmetry protected non-trivial topological winding number. Furthermore, we also observe stroboscopic topologically protected localised edge states in a long open chain and show that a bulk boundary correspondence survives a unitary non-equilibrium situation in 1D BDI Hamiltonians."

This framework has been limited to linear lattice dynamics so far. Here we show a topological transition in a nonlinear regime and its implication in emerging nonlinear solutions. We employ nonlinearity management such that the system consists of masses connected with two types of nonlinear springs, \"stiffening\" and \"softening\" types, alternating along the length. We show, analytically and numerically, that the lattice makes a topological transition simply by changing the excitation amplitude and invoking nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we witness the emergence of a new family of finite-frequency edge modes, not observed in linear phononic systems. We also report the existence of kink solitons at the topological transition point. These correspond to heteroclinic orbits that form a closed curve in the phase portrait separating the two topologically-distinct regimes. These findings suggest that nonlinearity can be used as a strategic tuning knob to alter topological characteristics of phononic crystals. These also provide fresh perspectives towards understanding a new family of nonlinear solutions in light of topology."

A striking result is a common mean observed radio luminosity from the black hole candidates (BHCs) in the Low/Hard X-ray state and the neutron-star Z sources on the horizontal X-ray branch. This implies a common mean intrinsic radio luminosity to within a factor of twenty five (or less, if there is significant Doppler boosting of the radio emission). Unless coincidental, these results imply a physical mechanism for jet formation which requires neither a black hole event horizon or a neutron star surface. As a whole the populations of Atoll and X-ray pulsar systems are less luminous by factors of >5 and >10 at radio wavelengths than the BHCs and Z sources (while some Atoll sources have been detected, no high-field X-ray pulsar has ever been reliably detected as a radio source). We suggest that all of the persistent BHCs and the Z sources generate, at least sporadically, an outflow with physical dimensions > 1e12cm, i.e. significantly larger than the binary separations of most of the systems. We compare the physical conditions of accretion in each of the types of persistent X-ray binary and conclude that a relatively low (<1e10 G) magnetic field associated with the accreting object, and a high (>0.1 Eddington) accretion rate and/or dramatic physical change in the accretion flow, are required for formation of a radio-emitting outflow or jet."

Common goodness of fit methods are based on the calculation of the distribution of certain statistical quantities under the assumption that the model under consideration {\\it holds true}. This proceeding bears methodological flaws, e.g. a good ``fit'' - albeit the model is wrong - might be due to over-fitting, or to the fact that the chosen statistical criterion is not powerful enough against the present particular deviation between model and true regression function. This causes particular difficulties when models with different numbers of parameters are to be compared. Therefore the number of parameters is often penalised additionally. We provide a methodology which circumvents these problems to some extent. It is based on the consideration of the error distribution of the goodness of fit criterion under a broad range of possible models - and not only under the assumption that a given model holds true. We present a graphical method to decide for the most evident model from a range of parametric models of the data. The method allows to quantify statistical evidence {\\it for} the model (up to some distance between model and true regression function) and not only {\\it absence of evidence} against, as common goodness of fit methods do.

However this theory has encountered certain conceptual difficulties like non-locality in time, self force of the electron, pre acceleration and the perfect absorption condition of Feynman and Wheeler, that is the instantaneous action of the remaining charges in the universe on the charge in question. More recently, Hoyle and Narlikar have resurrected this theory, but within the context of a Steady State or Quasi Steady State cosmology. They argue that the theory infact has a better standing than the generally accepted quantum theoretic description. In this article we consider a quantum theoretic description and a cosmology which parallels the Hoyle-Narlikar approach. This leads to a synthesis and justification of the Dirac and Feynman-Wheeler approaches, clarifying the conceptual problems in the process. We deduce a scenario with quantized space-time and a holistic cosmology, consistent with physical and astrophysical data. The non-locality is now seen to be meaningful within the minimum space-time intervals, as also the perfect absorption within the holistic description. Local realism, and the usual causal field theory are seen to have an underpinning of direct action. For example this is brought out by the virtual photons which mediate interactions in Quantum Electro Dynamics, and the emergence of the inverse square law in the above approach from a background Zero Point Field."

We will see the essence of the generalized photon sphere is not the stationary cycling of the photon orbits, which is the concept only available in a stationary spacetime, but their accumulation. With any wandering null geodesic, it is implied that this accumulation will be occur anywhere in an asymptotically flat spacetime."

        "Title": "The Discovery of a Planetary Companion to 16 Cygni B",
        "Abstract": "High precision radial velocity observations of the solar-type star 16 Cygni B taken at McDonald Observatory and at Lick Observatory, have each independently discovered periodic radial-velocity variations indicating the presence of a Jovian-mass companion to this star. The orbital fit to the combined data gives a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude of 43.9 m/s, and an eccentricity of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 Msun, this implies a mass for the companion of 1.5 sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital eccentricity cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal manner with a low eccentricity orbit, and has undergone post-formational orbital evolution, either through the same process which formed the ``massive eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD114762, or by gravitational interactions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the object is an extremely low mass brown dwarf, formed through fragmentation of the collapsing protostar. We explore a possible connection between stellar photospheric Li depletion, pre-main sequence stellar rotation, the presence of a massive proto-planetary disk, and the formation of a planetary companion."

        "Abstract": "In this paper we pursue a new technique to search for evidence of a finite Universe, making use of a spherical mexican-hat wavelet decomposition of the microwave background fluctuations. Using the information provided by the wavelet coefficients at several scales we test whether compact orientable flat topologies are consistent with the COBE-DMR data. We consider topological sizes ranging from half to twice the horizon size. A scale-scale correlation test indicates that non-trivial topologies with appropriate topological sizes are as consistent with the COBE-DMR data as an infinite universe. Among the finite models the data seems to prefer a Universe which is about the size of the horizon for all but the hypertorus and the triple-twist torus. For the latter the wavelet technique does not seem a good discriminator of scales for the range of topological sizes considered here, while a hypertorus has a preferred size which is 80% of the horizon. This analysis allows us to find a best fit topological size for each model, although cosmic variance might limit our ability to distinguish some of the topologies."

        "Abstract": "We construct analogues for the quantum phenomena of black hole radiation in the context of {\\it classical field theory}. Hawking radiation from a (radially) collapsing star is mathematically equivalent to radiation from a mirror moving along a specific trajectory in Minkowski spacetime. We construct a classical analogue for this quantum phenomenon and use it to construct a classical analogue for black hole radiation. The radiation spectrum in quantum field theory has the power spectrum as its classical analogue. Monochromatic light is continually reflected off a moving mirror or the silvered surface of a collapsing star.The reflected light is fourier analysed by the observer and the power spectrum is constructed. For a mirror moving along the standard black hole trajectory,it is seen that the power spectrum has a ``thermal'' nature. Mirror-observer configurations like an inertial mirror observed in an accelerated observer's frame and an accelerated mirror observed in a Rindler frame are investigated and conditions for obtaining a ``thermal'' power spectrum are derived.The corresponding results in the black hole case are then elucidated.It is seen that a ``thermal'' spectrum can arise either due to the collapse of the star or due to the motion of the observer in the Schwarzchild spacetime. The ``temperature'' of the Planckian spectrum seen is therefore dependent on whether the star or the observer is in motion.In the latter case it is possible to obtain a ``temperature'' which is entirely independent of the mass of the star."

The associated chain complex is endowed with a Lie algebra up to homotopy structure. Its Maurer-Cartan elements correspond to deformed structures, which allows us to give a geometric interpretation of these results.   To do so, we endow the category of prop(erad)s with a model category structure. We provide a complete study of models for prop(erad)s. A new effective method to make minimal models explicit, that extends Koszul duality theory, is introduced and the associated notion is called homotopy Koszul.   As a corollary, we obtain the (co)homology theories of (al)gebras over a prop(erad) and of homotopy (al)gebras as well. Their underlying chain complex is endowed with a canonical Lie algebra up to homotopy structure in general and a Lie algebra structure only in the Koszul case. In particular, we explicit the deformation complex of morphisms from the properad of associative bialgebras. For any minimal model of this properad, the boundary map of this chain complex is shown to be the one defined by Gerstenhaber and Schack. As a corollary, this paper provides a complete proof of the existence of a Lie algebra up to homotopy structure on the Gerstenhaber-Schack bicomplex associated to the deformations of associative bialgebras."

We investigate a common limitation across state-of-the-art SyGuS tools that perform counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We empirically observe that as the expressiveness of the provided grammar increases, the performance of these tools degrades significantly.   We claim that this degradation is not only due to a larger search space, but also due to overfitting. We formally define this phenomenon and prove no-free-lunch theorems for SyGuS, which reveal a fundamental tradeoff between synthesizer performance and grammar expressiveness.   A standard approach to mitigate overfitting in machine learning is to run multiple learners with varying expressiveness in parallel. We demonstrate that this insight can immediately benefit existing SyGuS tools. We also propose a novel single-threaded technique called hybrid enumeration that interleaves different grammars and outperforms the winner of the 2018 SyGuS competition (Inv track), solving more problems and achieving a $5\\times$ mean speedup."

        "Title": "Inelastic tunneling effects on noise properties of molecular junctions",
        "Abstract": "The effect of electron-phonon coupling on the current noise in a molecular junction is investigated within a simple model. The model comprises a 1-level bridge representing a molecular level that connects between two free electron reservoirs and is coupled to a vibrational degree of freedom representing a molecular vibrational mode. The latter in turn is coupled to a phonon bath that represents the thermal environment. We focus on the zero frequency noise spectrum and study the changes in its behavior under weak and strong electron-phonon interactions. In the weak coupling regime we find that the noise amplitude can increase or decrease as a result of opening of an inelastic channel, depending on distance from resonance and on junction asymmetry. In particular the relative Fano factor decreases with increasing off resonance distance and junction asymmetry. For resonant inelastic tunneling with strong electron-phonon coupling the differential noise spectrum can show phonon sidebands in addition to a central feature. Such sidebands can be observed when displaying the noise against the source-drain voltage, but not in noise vs. gate voltage plots obtained at low source-drain bias. A striking crossover of the central feature from double to single peak is found for increasing asymmetry in the molecule-leads coupling or increasing electron-phonon interaction. These variations provide a potential diagnostic tool. A possible use of noise data from scanning tunneling microscopy experiments for estimating the magnitude of the electron-phonon interaction on the bridge is proposed."

Hitherto, the highest measured redshift for a GRB has been z=4.50. Here we report the optical spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 050904 obtained 3.4 days after the burst. The spectrum shows a clear continuum at the long wavelength end of the spectrum with a sharp cutoff at around 9000 A due to Ly alpha absorption at a redshift of 6.3 with a damping wing. Little flux is present in the waveband shortward of the Ly alpha break. A system of absorption lines of heavy elements at redshift z=6.295 +- 0.002 were also detected, yielding a precise measurement of the largest known redshift of a GRB.

We compare results from a LambdaCDM simulation with a LambdaWDM (2keV) simulation that forms significantly less small scale structure. We show how high mass and force resolution in both the gas and dark matter components play an important role in solving the angular momentum catastrophe claimed from previous simulations of galaxy formation within the hierarchical framework. The stellar material in the disk component has a final specific angular momentum equal to 40% and 90% of that of the dark halo in the LambdaCDM and LambdaWDM models respectively. The LambdaWDM galaxy has a drastically reduced satellite population and a negligible stellar spheroidal component. Encounters with satellites play only a minor role in disturbing the disk. Satellites possess a variety of star formation histories linked to mergers and pericentric passages along their orbit around the primary galaxy. In both cosmologies, the galactic halo retains most of the baryons accreted and builds up a hot gas phase with a substantial X-ray emission. Therefore, while we have been successful in creating a realistic stellar disk in a massive galaxy within the LambdaCDM scenario, energy injection emerges as necessary ingredient to reduce the baryon fraction in galactic halos, independent of the cosmology adopted.

        "Abstract": "The periodic Lorentz gas is a paradigmatic model to examine how macroscopic transport emerges from microscopic chaos. It consists of a triangular lattice of circular hard scatterers with a moving point particle. Recently this system became relevant as a model for electronic transport in low-dimensional nanosystems such as molecular graphene. However, to more realistically mimic such dynamics, the hard Lorentz gas scatterers should be replaced by soft potentials. Here we study diffusion in a soft Lorentz gas with Fermi potentials under variation of the total energy of the moving particle. Our goal is to understand the diffusion coefficient as a function of the energy. In our numerical simulations we identify three different dynamical regimes: (i) the onset of diffusion at small energies; (ii) a transition where for the first time a particle reaches the top of the potential, characterized by the diffusion coefficient abruptly dropping to zero; and (iii) diffusion at high energies, where the diffusion coefficient increases according to a power law in the energy. All these different regimes are understood analytically in terms of simple random walk approximations."

The source flared with a peak of at least 80 mJy in March 2004. The source was resolved by the Very Large Array into two components with a separation of ~0.7 arcsec and characteristic sizes of ~0.2 arcsec. The two components of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1 +/- 0.1. We detect an upper limit to the proper motion of the Eastern component of ~3 x 10^3 km s^-1 relative to Sgr A*. We detect a proper motion of ~10^4 km s^-1 for the Western component relative to Sgr A*. The transient was also detected at X-ray wavelengths with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton telescope and given the designation CXOGC J174540.0-290031. The X-ray source falls in between the two radio components. The maximum luminosity of the X-ray source is ~10^36 erg s^-1, significantly sub-Eddington. The radio jet flux density predicted by the X-ray/radio correlation for X-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less than the measured flux density. We conclude that the radio transient is the result of a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the X-ray source and interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the Galactic Center."

String-net models are usually considered for spherical fusion categories, and in this case the vector spaces agree with the state spaces of the corresponding Turaev-Viro topological quantum field theory.   In the present work some effects of dropping the sphericality condition are investigated. In one example of non-spherical pivotal fusion categories, the string-net space counts the number of r-spin structures on a surface and carries an isomorphic representation of the mapping class group. Another example concerns the string-net space of a sphere with one marked point labelled by a simple object Z of the Drinfeld centre. This space is found to be non-zero iff Z is isomorphic to a non-unit simple object determined by the non-spherical pivotal structure.   The last example mirrors the effect of deforming the stress tensor of a two-dimensional conformal field theory, such as in the topological twist of a supersymmetric theory."

The characterization of the convective pattern in RSGs is crucial to solve the mass-loss mechanism which contributes heavily to the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. We show here how the astrophysical objectives and the array configuration are highly dependent to design a hypertelescope. For a given field of view and a given resolution, there is a trade-off between the array geometry and the number of required telescopes to optimize either the (u,v) coverage (to recover the intensity distribution) or the dynamic range (to recover the intensity contrast). To obtain direct snapshot images of Betelgeuse with a hypertelescope, a regular and uniform layout of telescopes is the best array configuration to recover the intensity contrast and the distribution of both large and small granulation cells, but it requires a huge number of telescopes (several hundreds or thousands). An annular configuration allows a reasonable number of telescopes (lower than one hundred) to recover the spatial structures but it provides a low-contrast image. Concerning the design of a pupil densifier to combine all the beams, the photometric fluctuations are not critical Delta photometry < 50%) contrary to the residual piston requirements (OPD <lambda/8) which requires the development of an efficient cophasing system to fully exploit the imaging capability of a hypertelecope."

        "Abstract": "In Bayesian classification, it is important to establish a probabilistic model for each class for likelihood estimation. Most of the previous methods modeled the probability distribution in the whole sample space. However, real-world problems are usually too complex to model in the whole sample space; some fundamental assumptions are required to simplify the global model, for example, the class conditional independence assumption for naive Bayesian classification. In this paper, with the insight that the distribution in a local sample space should be simpler than that in the whole sample space, a local probabilistic model established for a local region is expected much simpler and can relax the fundamental assumptions that may not be true in the whole sample space. Based on these advantages we propose establishing local probabilistic models for Bayesian classification. In addition, a Bayesian classifier adopting a local probabilistic model can even be viewed as a generalized local classification model; by tuning the size of the local region and the corresponding local model assumption, a fitting model can be established for a particular classification problem. The experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of local probabilistic models for Bayesian classification."

Our approach utilizes the fact that a network modelled from a single non-interacting Gaussian chain of macroscopic size can be solved exactly, even for randomly distributed crosslinking junctions. We derive an {\\it exact} expression for the partition function of such a generalized Gaussian structure in the presence of random external fields and for its scattering function $S_0$. We show that $S_0$ of a randomly crosslinked Gaussian network (RCGN) is a self-averaging quantity and depends only on crosslink concentration $M/N$, where $M$ and $N$ are the total numbers of crosslinks and monomers. From our derivation we find that the radius of gyration $R_{\\mbox{\\tiny g}}$ of a RCGN is of the universal form $R_{\\mbox{\\tiny g}}^2=(0.26 \\pm 0.01)a^2 N/M$, with $a$ being the Kuhn length. To treat the excluded volume effect in a systematic, perturbative manner, we expand the Deam-Edwards partition function in terms of density fluctuations analogous to the theory of linear polymers. For a highly crosslinked interacting network we derive an expression for the free energy of the system in terms of $S_0$ which has the same role in our model as the Debye function for linear polymers. Our ideas are easily generalized to crosslinked polymer blends which are treated within a modified version of Leibler's mean field theory for block copolymers."

        "Abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a low-dimensional signal model from a collection of training samples. The mainstream approach would be to learn an overcomplete dictionary to provide good approximations of the training samples using sparse synthesis coefficients. This famous sparse model has a less well known counterpart, in analysis form, called the cosparse analysis model. In this new model, signals are characterised by their parsimony in a transformed domain using an overcomplete (linear) analysis operator. We propose to learn an analysis operator from a training corpus using a constrained optimisation framework based on L1 optimisation. The reason for introducing a constraint in the optimisation framework is to exclude trivial solutions. Although there is no final answer here for which constraint is the most relevant constraint, we investigate some conventional constraints in the model adaptation field and use the uniformly normalised tight frame (UNTF) for this purpose. We then derive a practical learning algorithm, based on projected subgradients and Douglas-Rachford splitting technique, and demonstrate its ability to robustly recover a ground truth analysis operator, when provided with a clean training set, of sufficient size. We also find an analysis operator for images, using some noisy cosparse signals, which is indeed a more realistic experiment. As the derived optimisation problem is not a convex program, we often find a local minimum using such variational methods. Some local optimality conditions are derived for two different settings, providing preliminary theoretical support for the well-posedness of the learning problem under appropriate conditions."

Following Bacry and Kihlberg a four-dimensional internal spin space $\\bar S$ is chosen possessing an invariant measure and being able to represent integer as well as half integer spins. $\\bar S$ is a homogeneous space of the group $SL(2, C)$ parametrized in terms of spinors $\\a\\in C_2$ and their complex conjugates $\\bar\\a$. The generalized scalar quantum mechanical wave functions may be reduced to yield irreducible components of definite physical mass and spin $[m,s]$, with $m\\ge 0$ and $s=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 ...$, with spin described in terms of the usual $(2s+1)$-component fields. Viewed from the internal space description of spin this reduction amounts to a restriction of the variable $\\a$ to a compact subspace of $\\bar S$, i.e. a ``spin shell'' $S^2_{r=2s}$ of radius $r=2s$ in $ C_2$. This formulation of single particles or single antiparticles of type $[m,s]$ is then used to study the geometro- stochastic (i.e. quantum) propagation of amplitudes for arbitrary spin on a curved background space-time possessing a metric and axial vector torsion treated as external fields. A Poincar\\'e gauge covariant path integral-like representation for the probability amplitude (generalized wave function) of a particle with arbitrary spin is derived satisfying a second order wave equation on the Hilbert bundle constructed over curved space-time.

We do not find a significant correlation between SFR and the observed instantaneous $L_X$ for star forming AGN host galaxies. However, there is a weak but significant correlation between the mean $L_\\mathrm{X}$ and SFR of detected AGN in star forming galaxies, which likely reflects that $L_\\mathrm{X}$ varies on shorter timescales than SFR. We find no correlation between stellar mass and $L_\\mathrm{X}$ within the AGN population. Within both populations of star forming and quiescent galaxies, we find a similar power-law distribution in the probability of hosting an AGN as a function of specific accretion rate. Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, we find a star forming galaxy $\\sim2-3$ more likely than a quiescent galaxy to host an AGN of a given specific accretion rate. The probability of a galaxy hosting an AGN is constant across the main sequence of star formation. These results indicate that there is an underlying connection between star formation and the presence of AGN, but AGN are often hosted by quiescent galaxies."

Specifically, the proposed control architecture addresses the problem of reaching a given final set $S$ in a prescribed (user-defined) time with bounded control inputs. To this end, a time transformation technique is utilized to transform the system subject to temporal constraints into an equivalent form without temporal constraints. The transformation is defined so that asymptotic convergence in the transformed time scale results into prescribed-time convergence in the original time scale. To incorporate input constraints, we characterize a set of initial conditions $D_M$ such that starting from this set, the closed-loop trajectories reach the set $S$ within the prescribed time. We further show that starting from outside the set $D_M$, the system trajectories reach the set $D_M$ in a finite time that depends upon the initial conditions and the control input bounds. We use a novel parameter $\\mu$ in the controller, that controls the convergence-rate of the closed-loop trajectories and dictates the size of the set $D_M$.

When used in rotating devices of this kind, however, the YBCO can be subjected to both transient and alternating magnetic fields that are not parallel to the direction of magnetization and which have a detrimental effect on the trapped field. These effects may lead to a long-term decay of the magnetization of the bulk sample. In the present work, we analyze both experimentally and numerically the remagnetization process of a melt-processed YBCO single domain that has been partially demagnetized by a magnetic field applied orthogonal to the initial direction of trapped flux. Magnetic torque measurements are used as a tool to probe changes in the remanent magnetization during various sequences of applied field. The application of a small magnetic field between the transverse cycles parallel to the direction of original magnetization results in partial remagnetization of the sample. Rotating the applied field, however, is found to be much more efficient at remagnetizing the bulk material than applying a magnetizing field pulse of the same amplitude. The principal features of the experimental data can be reproduced qualitatively using a two-dimensional finite-element numerical model based on an E-J power law. Finally, the remagnetization process is shown to result from the complex modification of current distribution within the cross-section of the bulk sample."

For the purely hydrodynamic case, it is known that large-scale perturbations tend to the minima of a Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional with a double-well (fourth-order) potential. The dynamics of the relaxation process is ruled by a one-dimensional Cahn--Hilliard equation that dictates the hyperbolic tangent profiles of kink-antikink structures and their mutual interactions. For the viscoelastic case, we found that the dynamics still admits a formulation in terms of a Ginzburg--Landau free-energy functional. For sufficiently small elasticities, the phenomenology is very similar to the purely hydrodynamic case: the free-energy functional is still a fourth-order potential and slightly perturbed kink-antikink structures hold. For sufficiently large elasticities, a critical point sets in: the fourth-order term changes sign and the next-order nonlinearity must be taken into account. Despite the double-well structure of the potential, the one-dimensional nature of the problem makes the dynamics sensitive to the details of the potential. We analysed the interactions among these generalized kink-antikink structures, demonstrating their role in a new, elastic instability. Finally, consequences for the problem of polymer drag reduction are presented."

Nucleation describes the formation of point-sized seeds, and after a seed is sown, it acts as an attractor and grows in size by the addition of grains of a fixed-sized. At each time step either an already-nucleated seed can increase in size, or a new seed may be nucleated. We incorporate a parameter $m$, to describe the relative rates of growth to nucleation. We solve the model analytically to obtain gap size distribution function and a general expression for the jamming coverage as a function of $m$.

The proposed approach clarifies how the BP algorithm works, simplifies the statistical analysis of its behavior, and enables us to develop a performance optimization framework for the BP-based distributed inference systems. Next, we propose a blind learning-adaptation scheme to optimize the system performance when there is no information available a priori describing the statistical behavior of the wireless environment concerned. In addition, we propose a blind threshold adaptation method to guarantee a certain performance level in a BP-based distributed detection system.

The 2-colour parity is an extension of the Gaussian parity, to which it reduces on virtual knots. We show that the 2-colour parity descends to a parity on free links. We compare the 2-colour parity to other parity theories of virtual links, focusing on a theory due to Im and Park. The 2-colour parity yields a strictly stronger invariant than the Im-Park parity. We introduce an invariant, the 2-colour writhe, that takes the form of a string of integers. The 2-colour writhe is a concordance invariant, and so obstructs sliceness. It is also an obstruction to amphichirality and chequerboard colourability within a concordance class."

The brane is described as a field theoretical domain wall in the context of an axion-like model consisting of a complex scalar effective field theory with approximate U(1) symmetry. We simulate numerically the dynamics of the collision and illustrate the transition from the configuration without a hole to the pierced one with the aid of a phase diagram. The process of perforation is found to depend on the collisional velocity, and, contrary to our expectation, we observe that above a critical value of the velocity, the black hole has no chance to perforate the wall. That is: high energy collisions do not assist piercing. We also show that, only when the model parameters are fine-tuned so that the energy scale of the string is very close to that of the domain wall, the collision of the wall with the black hole has a possibility to provide a mechanism to erase domain walls, if the hole expands. However, in such cases, domain walls will form with many holes edged by a string and therefore disappear eventually. Therefore this mechanism is unlikely to be a solution to the cosmological domain wall problem, although it may cause some minor effects on the evolution of a domain wall network."

We believe that this model describes a high-mobility semiconductor heterostructure with a random array of antidots. We show that the interplay of scattering by the two types of disorder generates new behavior of $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ which is absent for only one kind of disorder. We demonstrate that even a weak long-range disorder becomes important with increasing $B$. In particular, although $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ vanishes in the limit of large $B$ when only one type of disorder is present, we show that it keeps growing with increasing $B$ in the antidot array in the presence of smooth disorder. The reversal of the behavior of $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ is due to a mutual destruction of the quasiclassical localization induced by a strong magnetic field: specifically, the adiabatic localization in the long-range Gaussian disorder is washed out by the scattering on hard discs, whereas the adiabatic drift and related percolation of cyclotron orbits destroys the localization in the dilute system of hard discs. For intermediate magnetic fields in a dilute antidot array, we show the existence of a strong negative magnetoresistance, which leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of $\\rho_{xx}(B)$."

Graph Signal Processing (GSP) represents a very simple case of Topological Signal Processing (TSP), referring to the situation where the signals are associated only with the vertices of a graph. We are interested in the most general case, where the signals are associated with vertices, edges and higher order complexes. After reviewing the basic principles of algebraic topology, we show how to build unitary bases to represent signals defined over sets of increasing order, giving rise to a spectral simplicial complex theory. Then we derive a sampling theory for signals of any order and emphasize the interplay between signals of different order. After having established the analysis tools, we propose a method to infer the topology of a simplicial complex from data. We conclude with applications to real edge signals to illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodologies."

It can be considered a generalization of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm (SGD), where instead of updating the weight vector along the negative direction of the stochastic gradient, the update is performed in a \"mirror domain\" defined by the gradient of a (strictly convex) potential function. This potential function, and the mirror domain it yields, provides considerable flexibility in the algorithm compared to SGD. While many properties of SMD have already been obtained in the literature, in this paper we exhibit a new interpretation of SMD, namely that it is a risk-sensitive optimal estimator when the unknown weight vector and additive noise are non-Gaussian and belong to the exponential family of distributions. The analysis also suggests a modified version of SMD, which we refer to as symmetric SMD (SSMD). The proofs rely on some simple properties of Bregman divergence, which allow us to extend results from quadratics and Gaussians to certain convex functions and exponential families in a rather seamless way."

Previous works have studied the problem of detecting whether a target cable configuration is intersecting (or entangled). Here, we are interested in the motion planning problem: how to plan and coordinate the robot motions to realize a given non-intersecting target cable configuration. We identify four possible modes of motion, depending on whether (i) the robots move in straight lines or following their cable lines; (ii) the robots move sequentially or concurrently. We present an in-depth analysis of Straight & Concurrent, which is the most practically-interesting mode of motion. In particular, we propose algorithms that (a) detect whether a given target cable configuration is realizable by a Straight & Concurrent motion, and (b) return a valid coordinated motion plan.

After a review of the fundamental features characterizing the inflationary model, as referred to a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, we develop a generalization in view of including small inhomogeneous corrections in the theory. A second step in our discussion is devoted to show that the inflationary scenario provides a valuable dynamical ``bridge'' between a generic Kasner-like regime and a homogeneous and isotropic Universe in the horizon scale. This result is achieved by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a Bianchi IX model in the presence of a cosmological space-dependent term. In this respect, we construct a quasi-isotropic inflationary solution based on the expansion of the Einstein equations up to first-two orders of approximation, in which the isotropy of the Universe is due to the dominance of the scalar field kinetic term; the first order of approximation corresponds to the inhomogeneous corrections and is driven by the matter evolution. We show how such a quasi-isotropic solution contains a certain freedom in fixing the space functions involved in the problem. The main physical issue of this analysis corresponds to outline the impossibility for the classical origin of density perturbations, due to the exponential decay of the matter term during the de Sitter phase."

According to Kohn's theorem, the frequency of this collective mode is not affected by an interaction between the atoms and is always equal to the trap frequency. This remarkable property, however, does not necessarily hold in an approximate theory. We explicitly prove that the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA), including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels, is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory developed by Nozi\\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\\it depend} on the strength of effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance."

This N-body experiment simulates almost the full ``Hubble Volume'' of the universe, thus, for the first time, it allowed for an accurate analysis of the cosmic distribution function, and, in particular, of its variance (Delta A)^2, the cosmic error. The resulting detailed knowledge about the shape of Upsilon is crucial for likelihood analyses. The measured cosmic error agrees remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of Szapudi & Colombi (1996) and Szapudi, Bernardeau & Colombi (1998) in the weakly non-linear regime, while the predictions are slightly above the measurements in the highly nonlinear regime. When the relative cosmic error is small, (Delta A/A)^2, function Upsilon is nearly Gaussian. When (Delta A/A)^2 approaches unity or is larger, function Upsilon(VA) is increasingly skewed and well approximated by a lognormal distribution for A=F_k, or A=xiav.

        "Abstract": "Electro-vacuum black holes are scale-invariant; their energy-momentum tensor is traceless. Quantum corrections of various sorts, however, can often produce a trace anomaly and a breakdown of scale-invariance. The (quantum-corrected) black hole solutions of the corresponding gravitational effective field theory (EFT) have a non-vanishing Ricci scalar. Then, the presence of a scalar field with the standard non-minimal coupling $\\xi \\phi^2 R$ naturally triggers a spontaneous scalarisation of the corresponding black holes. This scalarisation phenomenon occurs for an (infinite) discrete set of $\\xi$. We illustrate the occurrence of this phenomenon for two examples of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole solution of EFTs. In one example the trace anomaly comes from the matter sector -- a novel, closed form, generalisation of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution with an $F^4$ correction -- whereas in the other example it comes from the geometry sector -- a noncommutative geometry generalization of the Schwarzschild black hole. For comparison, we also consider the scalarisation of a black hole surrounded by (non-conformally invariant) classical matter (Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes). We find that the scalarised solutions are, generically, entropically favoured."

The result indicates that a kinetic area-cells model of the BH's horizon can model the evolution of BH due to the Hawking radiation, and this area-cell system can be considered as an interacting geometrical particle system. Thus the evolution turns into a problem of statistical physics. In the present work, this problem is treated in the framework of non-equilibrium statistics. It is proposed that each area-cell possesses the energy like a microscopic black hole, and has the gravitational interaction with the other area-cells. We consider both a non-interaction ideal system, and a system with small nearest-neighbor interactions, and obtain an analytic expression of the expected value of the horizon area of a dynamical BH. We find that, after a long enough evolution, a dynamical BH with the Hawking radiation can be in equilibrium with a finite temperature radiation field. However, we also find that, the system has a critical point, and when the temperature of the radiation field surrounding the BH approaches the critical temperature of the BH, a critical slowing down phenomenon occurs."

We then define a `semistrict Lie 2-algebra' to be a 2-vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric bilinear functor satisfying the Jacobi identity up to a completely antisymmetric trilinear natural transformation called the `Jacobiator', which in turn must satisfy a certain law of its own. Much of the content of this first chapter has already appeared in a separate paper coauthored with John Baez, Higher Dimensional Algebra VI: Lie 2-algebras.   We then explore the relationship between Lie algebras and algebraic structures called `quandles'. A quandle is a set equipped with two binary operations satisfying axioms that capture the essential properties of the operations of conjugation in a group and algebraically encode the three Reidemeister moves. Indeed, we describe the relation to groups and show that quandles give invariants of braids. We further show that both Lie algebras and quandles give solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, and explain how conjugation plays a prominent role in the both the theories of Lie algebras and quandles. Inspired by these commonalities, we provide a novel, conceptual passage from Lie groups to Lie algebras using the language of quandles. Moreover, we propose relationships between higher Lie theory and higher-dimensional braid theory. We conclude with evidence of this connection by proving that any semistrict Lie 2-algebra gives a solution of the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation, which is the higher-dimensional analog of the Yang--Baxter equation."

Moreover, the Thurston norm unit ball of Y is dual to the polytope of \\underline{\\hfhat}(Y).   We prove a similar bijection and duality result for a class of 3-manifolds with boundary called sutured manifolds. A sutured manifold is essentially a cobordism between two surfaces R_+ and R_- that have nonempty boundary. We show that there is a bijection between vertices of the sutured Floer polytope carrying the group Z and equivalence classes of taut depth one foliations that form the foliation cones of Cantwell and Conlon. Moreover, we show that a function defined by Juh\\'asz, which we call the geometric sutured function,is analogous to the Thurston norm in this context. In some cases, this function is an asymmetric norm and our duality result is that appropriate faces of this norm's unit ball subtend the foliation cones.

        "Title": "Second-order Control of Complex Systems with Correlated Synthetic Data",
        "Abstract": "Generation of hybrid synthetic data resembling real data to some criteria is an important methodological and thematic issue in most disciplines which study complex systems. Interdependencies between constituting elements, materialized within respective relations, lead to the emergence of macroscopic patterns. Being able to control the dependance structure and level within a synthetic dataset is thus a source of knowledge on system mechanisms. We describe in this paper a methodology consisting in the generation of synthetic datasets on which correlation structure is controlled. The method is applied in a first example on financial time-series and allows to understand the role of interferences between components at different scales on performances of a predictive model. A second application on a geographical system is then proposed, in which the weak coupling between a population density model and a network morphogenesis model allows to simulate territorial configurations. The calibration on morphological objective on European data and intensive model exploration unveils a large spectrum of feasible correlations between morphological and network measures. We demonstrate therein the flexibility of our method and the variety of possible applications."

        "Abstract": "We investigate a 6d generalized Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario with a bulk cosmological constant. It is shown that each stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}^{i}$ on the brane is similar to a constant vacuum energy. This is consistent with the Randall-Sundrum model in which each 3-brane Lagrangian separated out a constant vacuum energy. By adopting an anisotropic metric ansatz, we obtain the 5d Friedmann-Robertson-Walker field equations. At a little later period, the expansion of the universe is proportional to $t^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ which is as similar as the period of the radiation-dominated. We also investigate the case with two $a(t)$ and two $b(t)$. In a large region of $t$, we obtain the 3d effective cosmological constant $\\Lambda_{eff}=-2\\Omega/3>0$ which is independent of the integral constant. Here the scale factor is exponential expansion which is consistent with our present observation of the universe. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to construct a model which solves the dark energy problem, meanwhile guaranteeing a positive brane tension."

        "Abstract": "We investigate a hierarchical structure formation scenario in which galaxy stellar cores are created from the binding energy liberated by shrinking supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. The binary orbital decay heats the surrounding stars, eroding a preexisting 1/r^2 stellar cusp. We follow the merger history of dark matter halos and associated SMBHs via cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present in a LCDM cosmology. Massive black holes get incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, sink to the center owing to dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, and form a binary system. Stellar dynamical processes drive the binary to harden and eventually coalesce. A simple scheme is applied in which the loss cone is constantly refilled and a constant density core forms due to the ejection of stellar mass. We find that a model in which the effect of the hierarchy of SMBH interactions is cumulative and cores are preserved during galaxy mergers produces at the present epoch a correlation between the `mass deficit' (the mass needed to bring a flat inner density profile to a 1/r^2 cusp) and the mass of the nuclear SMBH, with a normalization and slope comparable to the observed relation. Models in which the mass displaced by the SMBH binary is replenished after every major galaxy merger appear instead to underestimate the mass deficit observed in `core' galaxies."

        "Title": "A Relativistic Mean Field Model for Entrainment in General Relativistic  Superfluid Neutron Stars",
        "Abstract": "General relativistic superfluid neutron stars have a significantly more intricate dynamics than their ordinary fluid counterparts. Superfluidity allows different superfluid (and superconducting) species of particles to have independent fluid flows, a consequence of which is that the fluid equations of motion contain as many fluid element velocities as superfluid species. Whenever the particles of one superfluid interact with those of another, the momentum of each superfluid will be a linear combination of both superfluid velocities. This leads to the so-called entrainment effect whereby the motion of one superfluid will induce a momentum in the other superfluid. We have constructed a fully relativistic model for entrainment between superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons using a relativistic $\\sigma - \\omega$ mean field model for the nucleons and their interactions. In this context there are two notions of ``relativistic'': relativistic motion of the individual nucleons with respect to a local region of the star (i.e. a fluid element containing, say, an Avogadro's number of particles), and the motion of fluid elements with respect to the rest of the star. While it is the case that the fluid elements will typically maintain average speeds at a fraction of that of light, the supranuclear densities in the core of a neutron star can make the nucleons themselves have quite high average speeds within each fluid element. The formalism is applied to the problem of slowly-rotating superfluid neutron star configurations, a distinguishing characteristic being that the neutrons can rotate at a rate different from that of the protons."

By analogy with active galactic nuclei models, it has been proposed that Sgr A* may be a massive accreting black holes. The black hole hypothesis is, however, problematic because no model of Sgr A* has been able to explain the observed spectrum in any self-consistent way, and there is no consensus on either the mass of the black hole or the mass accretion rate. Sgr A* has been observed in the radio, sub-mm, infrared, and X-ray bands, and the various various detections and flux upper limits cover more than ten decades of frequency, from $\\nu\\sles\\ 10^9$ Hz (meter wavelength radio bands) up to $\\nu\\ \\sgreat\\ 10^{19}$ Hz (150 keV X-rays). We present a robust model of Sgr A* in which a million solar mass black hole accretes at the rate of a few $\\times10^{-6}$ solar masses per year. This model fits the entire spectrum self-consistently. The unique feature of the model is that the flow is advection-dominated, i.e. most of the energy viscously dissipated in the differentially rotating flow is carried along with the gas and lost through the horizon. The apparent success of this model in explaining the data may be considered ``proof'' that horizons are real and that a massive black hole does exist at the Galactic center."

In particular, we attempt to overcharge a system of two extremal black holes via test particle absorption to produce a system involving a black hole and a naked singularity. If such a process is possible, then this would be a potential violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, we find that, analogous to Wald's result for a single charged black hole, such a test particle which can expose the singularity, would not be able to enter the horizon. This provides an interesting and non-trivial example that supports the validity of the cosmic censorship hypothesis in four-dimensional general relativity."

        "Abstract": "High precision radial velocity observations of the solar-type star 16 Cygni B taken at McDonald Observatory and at Lick Observatory, have each independently discovered periodic radial-velocity variations indicating the presence of a Jovian-mass companion to this star. The orbital fit to the combined data gives a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude of 43.9 m/s, and an eccentricity of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 Msun, this implies a mass for the companion of 1.5 sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital eccentricity cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal manner with a low eccentricity orbit, and has undergone post-formational orbital evolution, either through the same process which formed the ``massive eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD114762, or by gravitational interactions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the object is an extremely low mass brown dwarf, formed through fragmentation of the collapsing protostar. We explore a possible connection between stellar photospheric Li depletion, pre-main sequence stellar rotation, the presence of a massive proto-planetary disk, and the formation of a planetary companion."

        "Abstract": "We present a new experimental protocol for the spectroscopic study of the dynamics of glasses in the aging regime induced by sudden pressure jumps (crunches) across the glass transition line. The sample, initially in the liquid state, is suddenly brought in the glassy state, and therefore out of equilibrium, in a four-window optical crunch cell which is able to perform pressure jumps of 3 kbar in a time interval of ~10 ms. The main advantages of this setup with respect to previous pressure-jump systems is that the pressure jump is induced through a pressure transmitting fluid mechanically coupled to the sample stage through a deformable membrane, thus avoiding any flow of the sample itself in the pressure network and allowing to deal with highly viscous materials. The dynamics of the sample during the aging regime is investigated by Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS). For this purpose the crunch cell is used in conjunction with a high resolution double monochromator equipped with a CCD detector. This system is able to record a full spectrum of a typical glass forming material in a single 1 s shot. As an example we present the study of the evolution toward equilibrium of the infinite frequency longitudinal elastic modulus (M_infinity) of a low molecular weight polymer (Poly(bisphenol A-co-epichlorohydrin), glycidyl end capped). The observed time evolution of M_infinity, well represented by a single stretched exponential, is interpreted within the framework of the Tool-Narayanaswamy theory."

        "Abstract": "The genesis of spheroids is central to our understanding of galaxy formation -- they are relatively simple systems, containing about half the stellar mass of the Universe. A major subset of spheroids, massive elliptical galaxies, are preferentially found in clusters where they exhibit old, coeval stellar populations suggesting that they formed synchronously at early epochs. Here we report SCUBA submillimeter imaging of a region around a z=1.8 X-ray selected QSO. The image reveals a remarkable 400 kiloparsec long chain of galaxies each with an obscured star-formation rate sufficiently high to build a massive spheroid in less than 1 Gyr. The large over-density of these galaxies relative to expectations for a random field implies they probably reside in a structure associated with the QSO. We suggest that this star formation is associated with galaxy mergers or encounters within the filament, such as those predicted by the popular hierarchical model of galaxy formation. Our observations suggest that strong absorption in the X-ray spectra of QSOs at high-redshifts may result from a veil of gas thrown up by a merger or merger-induced activity, rather than an orientation-dependent obscuring torus. It is argued that these systems are the precursors of elliptical galaxies found today in the core regions of all rich galaxy clusters."

Thus, the outcoming concept of gauge spaces $(X, \\gamma)$ extends that of finite dimensional real Banach spaces by simply neglecting the symmetry axiom (a viewpoint that Minkowski already had in mind). If the dimension of $X$ is even, then the fixation of a symplectic form yields an identification between $X$ and its dual space $X^*$ . The image of the polar body $K^{\\circ}\\subseteq X^*$ under this identification yields a (skew-)dual gauge on $X$. In this paper, we study geometric properties of this so-called dual gauge, such as its behavior under isometries and its relation to orthogonality. A version of the Mazur-Ulam theorem for gauges is also proved. As an application of the theory, we show that closed characteristics of the boundary of a (smooth) convex body are optimal cases of a certain isoperimetric inequality."

        "Abstract": "A quantum state of an electron influences its electromagnetic field. If a spatial profile of the electron wave packet is not Gaussian, the particle may acquire additional intrinsic multipole moments, which alter its field, especially at small distances. Here the fields of a vortex electron with orbital angular momentum $\\ell$ are obtained in a form of a multipole expansion with an electric quadrupole term kept by using the generalized (non-paraxial) Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The quadrupole contribution arises beyond a paraxial approximation, is linearly enhanced for highly twisted packets with $|\\ell| \\gg 1$, and can be important for the interactions of twisted beams with bulk matter and artificial structures. Moreover, this term results in an azimuthal asymmetry of the magnetic field in a rest frame of the electron, which appears thanks to the spreading of the packet with time. Thus, somewhat contrary to physical intuition, the spreading may enhance non-paraxial phenomena. For the available electron beams, this asymmetry can in principle be reliably detected, which would be experimental evidence of a non-paraxial effect with the vortex electrons."

        "Abstract": "Let G be a finite graph or an infinite graph on which Z^d acts with finite fundamental domain. If G is finite, let T be a random spanning tree chosen uniformly from all spanning trees of G; if G is infinite, known methods show that this still makes sense, producing a random essential spanning forest of G. A method for calculating local characteristics (i.e. finite-dimensional marginals) of T from the transfer-impedance matrix is presented. This differs from the classical matrix-tree theorem in that only small pieces of the matrix (n-dimensional minors) are needed to compute small (n-dimensional) marginals. Calculation of the matrix entries relies on the calculation of the Green's function for G, which is not a local calculation. However, it is shown how the calculation of the Green's function may be reduced to a finite computation in the case when G is an infinite graph admitting a Z^d-action with finite quotient. The same computation also gives the entropy of the law of T. These results are applied to the problem of tiling certain lattices by dominos - the so-called dimer problem. Another application of these results is to prove modified versions of conjectures of Aldous on the limiting distribution of degrees of a vertex and on the local structure near a vertex of a uniform random spanning tree in a lattice whose dimension is going to infinity. Included is a generalization of moments to tree-valued random variables and criteria for these generalized moments to determine a distribution."

The SGA contains the geometrical symmetry algebra of the system plus a subalgebra of operators that give the spectrum of the system and connects the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian among themselves. In our case, the geometrical symmetry algebra is $\\frak{so}(3,1)$ and the SGA is $\\frak{so}(4,2)$. We start with a representation of $\\frak{so}(4,2)$ by functions on a realization of the Lobachevski space given by a two sheeted hyperboloid, where the Lie algebra commutators are the usual Poisson-Dirac brackets. Then, introduce a quantized version of the representation in which functions are replaced by operators on a Hilbert space and Poisson-Dirac brackets by commutators. Eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian are given and \"naive\" ladder operators are identified. The previously defined \"naive\" ladder operators shift the eigenvalues by a complex number so that an alternative approach is necessary. This is obtained by a non self-adjoint function of a linear combination of the ladder operators which gives the correct relation among the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. We give an eigenfunction expansion of functions over the upper sheet of two sheeted hyperboloid in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian."

The specific angular-momentum distributions within halos in N-body simulations match a universal shape, M(<j) \\propto j/(j_0+j). It is characterized by a power law over most of the mass, and one shape parameter in addition to the spin parameter \\lambda. The angular momentum tends to be aligned throughout the halo and of cylindrical symmetry. Even if angular momentum is conserved during baryonic infall, the resultant disk density profile is predicted to deviate from exponential, with a denser core and an extended tail. A slightly corrected version of the scaling relation due to linear tidal-torque theory is used to explain the origin of a typical power-law profile in shells, j(M) \\propto M^s with s \\gsim 1. While linear theory crudely predicts the amplitudes of halo spins, it is not a good predictor of their directions. Independently, mergers of halos are found to produce a similar profile due to j transfer from the orbit to the product halo via dynamical friction and tidal stripping. The halo spin is correlated with having a recent major merger, though this correlation is weakened by mass loss. These two effects are due to a correlation between the spins of neighboring halos and their orbit, leading to prograde mergers."

The strong coupling regime between the atom and cavity-confined photon corresponds to the reversible exchange of energy between the two modes, and underpins a wide range of CQED phenomena with applications in quantum information science, including for example as quantum logic gates and as sources of entangled states. An important advance was achieved recently when strong coupling between excitons and cavity photons was reported for the first time for localized quantum dots (QDs) in micron-size solid state cavities. This has significance in terms of scalability and integration with other optical devices, and could lead to the emergence of \"quantum optics on a chip\" technology. However the results presented so far for quantum dots are in the linear regime, corresponding to coupling to the vacuum field (vacuum Rabi splitting); they are not a true QED effect and can equally well be described by classical physics as the coupling between two oscillators. In this paper, we present evidence for a purely quantum phenomenon for the QD/cavity photon system, namely the increase in splitting of the levels when the mean number of photons in the cavity is increased. This corresponds to non-linearities on the single-photon scale: the presence of a single excitation in the cavity changes the level structure, affecting the emission energies for a second photon. Such results are a first step in demonstrating the promise of quantum dots for CQED applications."

This subsample excludes an exceedingly rare realization that yields an infinite-valued estimate of $\\lambda$. I present asymptotically valid formulas for the bias, root-mean-square prediction error, and standard deviation of the maximum likelihood estimate of $\\lambda$ for this subsample.

We calculate a flux-weighted mean red-shift of ~100 km/s and a flux-weighted mean velocity width of 800 km/s (FWHM) for lines from these elements. We also detect a number of transitions from Fe XVIII-XXIV and Ni XIX-XX in absorption; however, the identification of these lines is less certain and a greater range of shifts and breadth is measured. Our observation occurred at a binary phase of phi = 0.76; the lines observed are consistent with absorption in an ionized region of the supergiant O9.7 Iab companion wind. The spectrum is extremely complicated in that a range of temperatures and densities are implied. Prior Chandra HETGS spectra of Cygnus X-1 were obtained in a similar transition state (at phi = 0.93) and in the low/hard state (at phi= 0.84). Considered together, these spectra provide evidence for a companion wind that is focused as it flows onto the black hole primary in this system."

Tunneling fixed points are a subset of `termination' fixed points, which describe boundary conditions on a multicomponent edge. The requirement of unitary time evolution at the boundary gives a nontrivial consistency condition for possible low-energy boundary conditions. The effect of interactions and random hopping on fixed points is studied through a perturbative RG approach which generalizes the Giamarchi-Schulz RG for disordered Luttinger liquids to broken left-right symmetry and multiple modes. The allowed termination points of a multicomponent edge are classified by a B-matrix with rational matrix elements. We apply our approach to a number of examples, such as tunneling between a quantum Hall edge and a superconductor and tunneling between two quantum Hall edges in the presence of interactions. Interactions are shown to induce a continuous renormalization of effective tunneling charge for the integrable case of tunneling between two Laughlin states. The correlation functions of electronlike operators across a junction are found from the B matrix using a simple image-charge description, along with the induced lattice of boundary operators. Many of the results obtained are also relevant to ordinary Luttinger liquids."

The raw two-dimensional signals were sliced into segments of two gait cycles. A set of 20,250 segments from 30 subjects was used to configure and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best CNN classified a separated set containing 2,250 segments with 99.9% overall accuracy. A second set of 4,500 segments from the six remaining subjects was then used for transfer learning. Several small subsamples of this set were selected randomly and used for fine tuning. Training with two segments per subject was sufficient to achieve 100% accuracy. The results suggest that every person produces a unique trajectory of underfoot pressures and that CNNs can learn the distinctive features of these trajectories.

Hashing is a search method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory, and is used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement, and is a common activity performed frequently in a variety of applications.   Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison, and in doing so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity. Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative method for ordering the data than comparison, to exceed the linearithmic time complexity boundary on algorithmic performance.   The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by hashing, which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional sorting algorithm, the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time complexity factor -- even in the worst case.

The dynamic renormalization group is applied to the stochastic growth equation using the Martin, Sigga, and Rose formalism. The periodic potential and the quenched disorder, upon averaging, are combined into a single term in the generating functional. Changing the temperature (or the inherent noise of the deposition process) two different regimes with a transition between them at $T_{sr}$, are found: for $T>T_{sr}$ this term is irrelevant and the surface has the scaling properties of a surface growing on a flat substrate in the rough phase. The height-height correlations behave as $C(L,\\tau)\\sim \\ln [L f(\\tau/L^2)]$. While the linear response mobility is finite in this phase it does vanish as $(T-T_{sr})^{1.78}$ when $T\\rightarrow T_{sr}^+$. For $T<T_{sr}$ there is a line of fixed-point for the coupling constant. The surface is super-rough: the equilibrium correlation functions behave as $(\\ln L)^2$ while their short time dependence is $(\\ln \\tau) ^2$ with a temperature dependent dynamic exponent $z=2[1+1.78(1-T/T_{sr})]$. While the linear response mobility vanishes on large length scales, its scale-dependence leads to a non-linear response.

Considering stationary axially symmetric membranes, three different membrane-topologies are possible depending on the boundary conditions at infinity: 2+1 Minkowski topology, 2+1 wormhole topology and 2+1 black hole topology.   Interestingly, we find that the different membrane-topologies are connected via phase transitions of the form first discussed by Choptuik in investigations of scalar field collapse. More precisely, we find a first order phase transition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black hole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between Minkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a naked singularity.   For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation analogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the parameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions. We find that $Mass\\propto|\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_*|^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma\\approx 0.66$.

With a peak absolute R magnitude of -12 this event is distinctly brighter than novae, but fainter than type Ia supernovae (expected from a population of old stars in lenticular galaxies). Archival images of the field do not show a luminous star at that position with an upper limit of ~-4.1, so it is unlikely to be a giant eruption from a luminous blue variable star. Over a two month period the transient emitted radiation energy of almost 10E47 erg and subsequently faded in the opical sky. It is similar to, but more luminous at peak by a factor of 6 than, an enigmatic transient in the galaxy M31. A possible origin of M85 OT2006-1 is a stellar merger. If so, searches for similar events in nearby galaxies will not only allow to study the physics of hyper-Eddington sources, but also probe an important phase in the evolution of stellar binary systems."

        "Abstract": "In this research we focus on developing a reinforcement learning system for a challenging task: autonomous control of a real-sized boat, with difficulties arising from large uncertainties in the challenging ocean environment and the extremely high cost of exploring and sampling with a real boat. To this end, we explore a novel Gaussian processes (GP) based reinforcement learning approach that combines sample-efficient model-based reinforcement learning and model predictive control (MPC). Our approach, sample-efficient probabilistic model predictive control (SPMPC), iteratively learns a Gaussian process dynamics model and uses it to efficiently update control signals within the MPC closed control loop. A system using SPMPC is built to efficiently learn an autopilot task. After investigating its performance in a simulation modeled upon real boat driving data, the proposed system successfully learns to drive a real-sized boat equipped with a single engine and sensors measuring GPS, speed, direction, and wind in an autopilot task without human demonstration."

The ability to measure phase with this mixer allows for an atom-based receiver to detect digital modulated communication signals. In this paper, we demonstrate detection and reception of digital modulated signals based on various phase-shift keying approaches. We demonstrate Rydberg atom-based digital reception of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), and quadrature amplitude (QAM) modulated signals over a 19.626~GHz carrier to transmit and receive a bit stream in cesium vapor. We present measured values of Error Vector Magnitude (EVM, a common communication metric used to assess how accurate a symbol or bit stream is received) as a function of symbol rate for BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM modulation schemes. These results allow us to discuss the bandwidth of a Rydberg-atom based receiver system."

        "Abstract": "We develop appropriately generalized notions of indexability for problems of dynamic resource allocation where the resource concerned may be assigned more flexibility than is allowed, for example, in classical multi-armed bandits. Most especially we have in mind the allocation of a divisible resource (manpower, money, equipment) to a collection of objects (projects) requiring it in cases where its over-concentration would usually be far from optimal. The resulting project indices are functions of both a resource level and a state. They have a simple interpretation as a fair charge for increasing the resource available to the project from the specified resource level when in the specified state. We illustrate ideas by reference to two model classes which are of independent interest. In the first, a pool of servers is assigned dynamically to a collection of service teams, each of which mans a service station. We demonstrate indexability under a natural assumption that the service rate delivered is increasing and concave in the team size. The second model class is a generalization of the spinning plates model for the optimal deployment of a divisible investment resource to a collection of reward generating assets. Asset indexability is established under appropriately drawn laws of diminishing returns for resource deployment. For both model classes numerical studies provide evidence that the proposed greedy index heuristic performs strongly."

In particular, the values of a C*-valued inner product on a Hilbert C*-module are completely determined by the Hilbert norm induced from it. In addition, we obtain that two C*-valued inner products on a Banach C*-module inducing equivalent norms to the given one give rise to isometrically isomorphic Hilbert C*-modules if and only if the derived C*-algebras of ''compact'' module operators are *-isomorphic. The involution and the C*-norm of the C*-algebra of ''compact'' module operators on a Hilbert C*-module allow to recover its original C*-valued inner product up to the following equivalence relation: <.,.>_1 \\sim <.,.>_2 if and only if there exists an invertible, positive element $a$ of the center of the multiplier C*-algebra M(A) of A such that the identity <.,.>_1 \\equiv a \\cdot <.,.>_2 holds."

We examine the Einstein equations induced on a general $(n-2)$-brane of arbitrary tension, embedded in some $n$-dimensional bulk. The brane energy-momentum tensor enters these equations both linearly and quadratically. From the point of view of a homogeneous and isotropic brane we see quadratic deviations from the FRW equations of the standard cosmology. There is also a contribution from a bulk Weyl tensor. We study this in detail when the bulk is AdS-Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om AdS. This contribution can be understood holographically. For the AdS-Schwarzschild case, we show that the geometry on a brane near the AdS boundary is just that of a radiation dominated FRW universe. The radiation comes from a field theory that is dual to the AdS bulk. We also develop a new approach which allows us to consider branes that are not near the AdS boundary. This time the dual field theory contributes quadratic energy density/pressure terms to the FRW equations. Remarkably, these take exactly the same form as for additional matter placed on the brane by hand, with no bulk Weyl tensor.   We also derive the general equations of motion for a braneworld containing a domain wall. For the critical brane, the induced geometry is identical to that of a vacuum domain wall in $(n-1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity. We develop the tools to construct a nested Randall-Sundrum scenario whereby we have a ``critical'' domain wall living on an anti-de Sitter brane. We also show how to construct instantons on the brane, and calculate the probability of false vacuum decay."

Not qualifying as a conventional $c\\bar{c}$ state, the multiquark structure of this exotic meson has received very different interpretations, ranging from a compact tetraquark configuration to an extended $D\\bar D^*+c.c.$ molecule. In this work we explore the effect that a hot pion bath may have in the properties of the $X(3872)$, assuming this state to be a $D\\bar D^*+c.c.$ molecule. We derive the finite temperature effects on the $X(3872)$ from a coupled channels unitarized amplitude, obtained including the properties of the charmed mesons under such conditions. We find that the $X(3872)$ develops a subtantial width, of the order of a few tens of MeV, in hot pionic environments at temperatures $100-150$ MeV, and its nominal mass moves above the $D D^*$ threshold. The fact that the $X(3872)$ in a hot pion gas may no longer be a narrow resonance needs to be considered in the estimation of production yields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions."

For a given task, some architectures are eventually preferred over others, based on a mix of intuition, experience, experimentation and luck.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of capacity allocation analysis, with the aim of shedding some light on what network architectures focus their modelling capacity on, when used on a given task. We focus more particularly on spatial capacity allocation, which analyzes a posteriori the effective number of parameters that a given model has allocated for modelling dependencies on a given point or region in the input space, in linear settings. We use this framework to perform a quantitative comparison between some classical architectures on various synthetic tasks. Finally, we consider how capacity allocation might translate in non-linear settings."

        "Abstract": "By using a one-zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model of a disk galaxy undergoing a dusty starburst, we investigate, numerically, the optical spectroscopic properties in order to explore galaxy evolution in distant clusters. We adopt an assumption that the degree of dust extinction (represented by $A_V$) depends on the ages of starburst populations in such a way that younger stars have larger $A_V$ (originally referred to as selective dust extinction by Poggianti & Wu 2000). In particular, we investigate how the time evolution of the equivalent widths of [OII]$\\lambda$3727 and H$\\delta$ is controlled by the adopted age dependence. This leads to three main results: (1) If a young stellar population (with the age of $\\sim$ $10^6$ yr) is more heavily obscured by dust than an old one ($>$ $10^8$ yr), the galaxy can show an ``e(a)'' spectrum characterized by strong H$\\delta$ absorption and relatively modest [OII] emission. (2) A dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a) spectrum can evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k (or k+a) spectrum 0.2 Gyr after the starburst and then into a passive one with a k-type spectrum 1 Gyr after the starburst. This result clearly demonstrates an evolutionary link between galaxies with different spectral classes (i.e., e(b), e(a), a+k, k+a, and k). (3) A dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum even in the dusty starburst phase if the age-dependence of dust extinction is rather weak, i.e., if young starburst populations with different ages ($\\le$ $10^7$ yr) are uniformly obscured by dust."

        "Abstract": "We study the effect of spin-Peierls instability on the phase-diagram of a frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ladder, with weak transverse and diagonal rung coupling. Our analysis focuses on a one-dimensional version of the model (i.e. a single two-leg ladder) where we consider two forms of spin-Peierls (SP) instabilities on the legs: columnar dimers (CD) and staggered dimers (SD). We particularly examine the regime of parameters (corresponding to an intermediate XXZ anisotropy) where the SP and rung coupling terms are equally relevant. In both the CD and SD cases we find that the effective field theory describing the system is a self-dual sine-Gordon model, which favors ordering and the opening of a gap to excitations. The order parameter, which reflects the interplay between the SP and rung interactions, represents a crystal of 4-spin plaquettes on which longitudinal and transverse dimers are in a superposition. Depending on the SP instability mode these plaquettes are closed or open, however both types spontaneously break reflection symmetry across the ladder. The closed plaquettes are stable, while the open plaquette-order is relatively fragile and the corresponding gap may be tuned to zero under extreme conditions. We further find that a first order transition occurs from the Plaquette order to a valence bond crystal (VBC) of dimers on the legs. It is suggestive that in a higher dimensional version of this system, this variety of distinct VBC states with comparable energies leads to the formation of domains. Effectively one-dimensional gapless spinon modes on domain boundaries can possibly account for the experimental observation of a spin-liquid behavior in a physical realization of the model."

        "Abstract": "In this paper we provide a possible link between the structure of the bipolar nebula surrounding SN1987A and the properties of its progenitor star. A Wind Blwon Bubble (WBB) scenario is emplyed, in which a fast, tenuous wind from a Blue Supergiant expands into a slow, dense wind, expelled during an earlier Red Supergiant phase. The bipolar shapre develops due to a pole-to-equator density contrast in the slow wind (ie, the slow wind forms a slow torus). We use the Wind Compressed Disk (WCD) model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli (1992) to determine the shape of the slow torus. In the WCD scenario, the shape of the torus is determined by the rotation of the progenitor star. We then use a self-similar semi-analytical method for wind blown bubble evolution to determine the shape of the resulting bipolar nebula.   We find that the union of the wind-compressed-disk and bipolar-wind-blown- bubble models allows us to recover the salient properties of SN1987A's circumstellar nebula. In particular, the size, speed and density of SN1987A's inner ring are easily reproduced in our calculations. An exploration of parameter space shows the the red supergiant progenitor must be been rotating at > 0.3 of its breakup speed. We conclude that the progenitor was most likely spun up by a merger with a binary companion. Using a simple model for the binary merger we find that the companion is likely to have had a mass > 0.5 M_sun."

        "Abstract": "This paper considers the problem of optimum reconstruction in generalized sampling-reconstruction processes (GSRPs). We propose constrained GSRP, a novel framework that minimizes the reconstruction error for inputs in a subspace, subject to a constraint on the maximum regret-error for any other signal in the entire signal space. This framework addresses the primary limitation of existing GSRPs (consistent, subspace and minimax regret), namely, the assumption that the a priori subspace is either fully known or fully ignored. We formulate constrained GSRP as a constrained optimization problem, the solution to which turns out to be a convex combination of the subspace and the minimax regret samplings. Detailed theoretical analysis on the reconstruction error shows that constrained sampling achieves a reconstruction that is 1) (sub)optimal for signals in the input subspace, 2) robust for signals around the input subspace, and 3) reasonably bounded for any other signals with a simple choice of the constraint parameter. Experimental results on sampling-reconstruction of a Gaussian input and a speech signal demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

Specifically, our main result is to obtain for the first time the classical $r$-matrix structure within a covariant Poisson bracket for the Lax connection, or Lax one form. This exhibits a certain covariant nature of the classical $r$-matrix with respect to the underlying spacetime variables. The main result is established by means of several prototypical examples of integrable field theories, all equipped with a Zakharov-Shabat type Lax pair. Full details are presented for: $a)$ the sine-Gordon model which provides a relativistic example associated to a classical $r$-matrix of trigonometric type; $b)$ the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and the (complex) modified Korteweg-de Vries equation which provide two non-relativistic examples associated to the same classical $r$-matrix of rational type, characteristic of the AKNS hierarchy. The appearance of the $r$-matrix in a covariant Poisson bracket is a signature of the integrability of the field theory in a way that puts the independent variables on equal footing. This is in sharp contrast with the single-time Hamiltonian evolution context usually associated to the $r$-matrix formalism."

        "Abstract": "Given a stationary state for a noncommutative flow, we study a boundedness condition, depending on a positive parameter beta, which is weaker than the KMS equilibrium condition at inverse temperature beta. This condition is equivalent to a holomorphic property closely related to the one recently considered by Ruelle and D'Antoni-Zsido and shared by a natural class of non-equilibrium steady states. Our holomorphic property is stronger than the Ruelle's one and thus selects a restricted class of non-equilibrium steady states. We also introduce the complete boundedness condition and show this notion to be equivalent to the Pusz-Woronowicz complete passivity property, hence to the KMS condition.   In Quantum Field Theory, the beta-boundedness condition can be interpreted as the property that localized state vectors have energy density levels increasing beta-subexponentially, a property which is similar in the form and weaker in the spirit than the modular compactness-nuclearity condition. In particular, for a Poincare' covariant net of C*-algebras on the Minkowski spacetime, the beta-boundedness property, for beta greater equal than 2 pi, for the boosts is shown to be equivalent to the Bisognano-Wichmann property. The Hawking temperature is thus minimal for a thermodynamical system in the background of a Rindler black hole within the class of beta-holomorphic states. More generally, concerning the Killing evolution associated with a class of stationary quantum black holes, we characterize KMS thermal equilibrium states at Hawking temperature in terms of the boundedness property and the existence of a translation symmetry on the horizon."

        "Abstract": "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of green and sustainable projects has been found to be a necessary analysis in order to include all upstream, downstream, and indirect impacts. Because of the complexity of interactions, the differential impacts with respect to a baseline, i.e., a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, are commonly considered to relatively compare various projects. However, as the degree of penetration of a project in the baseline increases, the popular marginal assumption does no longer hold, and the differential impacts may become inconsistent. Although various mythologies have been successfully proposed and used to contain such a side effect, the bottom-up nature, which initiates the assessment from the project itself and ultimately widens the scope, could easily fail to acknowledge critical modifications to the baseline. This is highly relevant in terms of ICT's disruptive and dynamic technologies which push the baseline to become a marginal legacy. In this work, an analytic formalism is presented to provide a means of comparison of such technologies and projects. The core idea behind the proposed methodology is a magnitude-insensitive graph-based distance function to differentially compare a project with a baseline. The applicability of the proposed methodology is then evaluated in a use case of OTT/IPTV online media distribution services."

This is analogous to the solution path from the usual Lasso ($\\ell_1$-regularized) linear regression. We call the proposed procedure \"LassoNet\" and develop a projected proximal gradient algorithm for its optimization. This approach can sometimes give as low or lower test error than a standard neural network, and its feature selection provides more interpretable solutions.

We first tested it on noisy synthetic spectra of A, F, G, and K-type stars, and inverted simultaneously their atmospheric fundamental parameters: Teff, log g, [M/H] and vsini. Different learning databases were calculated using a range of sampling in Teff, log g, vsini, and [M/H]. Combined with a principal component analysis (PCA) nearest neighbors (NN) search, the size of the learning database is reduced. A Tikhonov regularization is applied, given the ill-conditioning of SIR. For all spectral types, decreasing the size of the learning database allowed us to reach internal accuracies better than PCA-based NN-search using larger learning databases. For each analyzed parameter, we have reached internal errors that are smaller than the sampling step of the parameter. We have also applied the technique to a sample of observed FGK and A stars. For a selection of well studied stars, the inverted parameters are in agreement with the ones derived in previous studies. The RSIR inversion technique, complemented with PCA pre-processing proves to be efficient in estimating stellar parameters of A, F, G, and K stars."

The spectral ranges analyzed are in the region of the stellar MgIb (5175 A), the near IR CaII triplet (8550 A) absorption features, and the region of the Halpha emission line. We have compared the shape of the stellar features with those of reference stars and determined the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) of the stellar component by using a two-dimensional Gaussian decomposition algorithm, and show for the first time the rotation curve of the stellar component in NGC 253. Comparing the recesion velocity curves of the gas and stars, it is seen that the stellar component has a decoupled kinematics respect to the gas, displaying a shollower velocity gradient and larger velocity dispersion that the gas in the inner regions. The minor axis kinematics together with the kinematics across the central 40$''$ along the major axis, suggest the presence of a rotating body with a kinematically misaligned axis respect to the main disk of the galaxy. The asymmetries in the LOSVD along the minor axis together with the steep velocity gradient of the gaseous component suggest a merger scenario to explain the these kinematically signatures. The enclosed mass in the central regions is computed to be (2.4+-0.5) 10^7$ Mo for a radius of r=0.7'' (10 pc). A double gaseous component in the central 6 arcsecs is detected from the [SIII] lambda 9069 A data along the minor axis; this seems to be the signature of a superbubble due to a supernova rate of 0.05 yr^{-1}."

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel computationally efficient dynamic bi-orthogonality based approach for calibration of a computer simulator with high dimensional parametric and model structure uncertainty. The proposed method is based on a decomposition of the solution into mean and a random field using a generic Karhunnen-Loeve expansion. The random field is represented as a convolution of separable Hilbert spaces in stochastic and spacial dimensions that are spectrally represented using respective orthogonal bases. In particular, the present paper investigates generalized polynomial chaos bases for stochastic dimension and eigenfunction bases for spacial dimension. Dynamic orthogonality is used to derive closed form equations for the time evolution of mean, spacial and the stochastic fields. The resultant system of equations consists of a partial differential equation (PDE) that define dynamic evolution of the mean, a set of PDEs to define the time evolution of eigenfunction bases, while a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) define dynamics of the stochastic field. This system of dynamic evolution equations efficiently propagates the prior parametric uncertainty to the system response. The resulting bi-orthogonal expansion of the system response is used to reformulate the Bayesian inference for efficient exploration of the posterior distribution. Efficacy of the proposed method is investigated for calibration of a 2D transient diffusion simulator with uncertain source location and diffusivity. Computational efficiency of the method is demonstrated against a Monte Carlo method and a generalized polynomial chaos approach."

        "Abstract": "We model the 1990 giant X-ray flare of the quiescent galaxy NGC 5905 as the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. From the observed rapid decline of the luminosity, over a timescale of a few years, we argue that the flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequent accretion via a thin disk. The fallback model allows constraints to be set on the black hole mass and the mass of debris. The latter must be very much less than a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. The observations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outer layers of a low-mass main sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarf or a giant planet. We find that the X-ray emission in the flare must have originated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus of circularized material surrounding the black hole. We suggest that the patch corresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impacts the torus. Interestingly, although the peak luminosity of the flare was highly sub-Eddington, the peak flux from the bright spot was close to the Eddington limit. We speculate on the implications of this result for observations of other flare events."

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations frequently employ periodic boundary conditions where the positions of the periodic images are manipulated in order to apply deformation to the material sample. For example, Lees-Edwards conditions use moving periodic images to apply simple shear. Here, we examine the problem of precisely comparing this type of simulation to continuum solid mechanics. We employ a hypo-elastoplastic mechanical model, and develop a projection method to enforce quasi-static equilibrium. We introduce a simulation framework that uses a fixed Cartesian computational grid on a reference domain, and imposes deformation via a time-dependent coordinate transformation to the physical domain. As a test case for our method, we consider the evolution of shear bands in a bulk metallic glass using the shear transformation zone theory of amorphous plasticity. We examine the growth of shear bands in simple shear and pure shear conditions as a function of the initial preparation of the bulk metallic glass."

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present the strategy of Agent Madoff, which is a heuristic-based negotiation agent that won 2nd place at the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC 2017). Agent Madoff is implemented to play the game Diplomacy, which is a strategic board game that mimics the situation during World War I. Each player represents a major European power which has to negotiate with other forces and win possession of a majority supply centers on the map. We propose a design architecture which consists of 3 components: heuristic module, acceptance strategy and bidding strategy. The heuristic module, responsible for evaluating which regions on the graph are more worthy, considers the type of region and the number of supply centers adjacent to the region and return a utility value for each region on the map. The acceptance strategy is done on a case-by-case basis according to the type of the order by calculating the acceptance probability using a composite function. The bidding strategy adopts a defensive approach aimed to neutralize attacks and resolve conflict moves with other players to minimize our loss on supply centers."

We present optical spectroscopy of the host galaxy which we find to be a dusty and apparently normal star-forming galaxy at z = 0.451. The unusually steep optical spectral slope of the afterglow can be explained by heavy extinction, A_V > 0.5 mag, along the line of sight to the GRB. Dust with similar A_V for the the host galaxy as a whole appears to be required by the measurement of a Balmer decrement in the spectrum of the host galaxy. Thanks to the low redshift, continued observations of the afterglow will enable the strongest constraints, to date, on the existence of a possible underlying supernova."

Unfortunately, quite often real socio-economic issues do not fulfill restrictive assumptions of procedures of causal analysis proposed in the literature. This paper indicates certain empirical challenges and conceptual opportunities related to applications of procedures of data depth concept into a process of causal inference as to socio-economic phenomena. We show, how to apply a statistical functional depths in order to indicate factual and counterfactual distributions commonly used within procedures of causal inference. Thus a modification of Rubin causality concept is proposed, i.e., a centrality-oriented causality concept. The presented framework is especially useful in a context of conducting causal inference basing on official statistics, i.e., basing on already existing databases. Methodological considerations related to extremal depth, modified band depth, Fraiman-Muniz depth, and multivariate Wilcoxon sum rank statistic are illustrated by means of example related to a study of an impact of EU direct agricultural subsidies on a digital development in Poland in a period of 2012-2019."

Resistivity and Hall effect measurements indicate weak anomalies at elevated temperatures ascribed to nematic transitions. A quasi-classical analysis of transport data, including in a pulsed magnetic field of up to 25 T, confirms the inversion of majority carriers type from holes in FeSe to electrons in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ at x $>$ 0.17. The temperature-dependent term in the elastoresistance of the studied compositions has a negative sign, which means that for substituted FeSe compositions, the elastoresistance is positive for hole-doped materials and negative for electron-doped materials just like in semiconductors such as silicon and germanium."

        "Abstract": "Stochastic mirror descent (SMD) is a fairly new family of algorithms that has recently found a wide range of applications in optimization, machine learning, and control. It can be considered a generalization of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm (SGD), where instead of updating the weight vector along the negative direction of the stochastic gradient, the update is performed in a \"mirror domain\" defined by the gradient of a (strictly convex) potential function. This potential function, and the mirror domain it yields, provides considerable flexibility in the algorithm compared to SGD. While many properties of SMD have already been obtained in the literature, in this paper we exhibit a new interpretation of SMD, namely that it is a risk-sensitive optimal estimator when the unknown weight vector and additive noise are non-Gaussian and belong to the exponential family of distributions. The analysis also suggests a modified version of SMD, which we refer to as symmetric SMD (SSMD). The proofs rely on some simple properties of Bregman divergence, which allow us to extend results from quadratics and Gaussians to certain convex functions and exponential families in a rather seamless way."

We also find that the line profile is variable over a timescale of a day or less. The core of the H-alpha line also shows a narrow Zeeman triplet corresponding to a field strength of of about 100kG which appears to be almost constant in shape. These observations suggest that the magnetic field on WD1953-011 has a complex structure and that the star has a rotational period of hours or days which causes the observed variability of the spectra. We argue that neither an offset dipole model nor a double-dipole model are sufficient to explain our observations. Instead, we propose a two component model consisting of a high field region of magnetic field strength of about 500kG covering about 10% of the surface area of the star superimposed on an underlying dipolar field of mean field strength of about 70kG. Radial velocity measurements of the narrow Zeeman triplet show that the radial velocity is constant to within a few km/s so this star is unlikely to be a close binary."

Built in the 1960s, it features a design in which the combined-function dipole magnets serve as vacuum chambers. Such a design is quite cost-effective, and it does not have the limitations associated with the eddy currents in a metallic vacuum chamber. However, an important drawback of that design is a high impedance, as seen by a beam, because of the magnet laminations. More recent RCS designs (e.g. J-PARC) employ large and complex ceramic vacuum chambers in order to mitigate the eddy current effects and to shield the beam from the magnet laminations. Such a design, albeit very successful, is quite costly because it requires large-bore magnets and large-bore RF cavities. In this article, we will consider an RCS concept with a thin-wall metallic vacuum chamber as a compromise between the chamber-less Fermilab Booster design and the large-bore design with ceramic chambers."

A numerical analysis of the relative branching ratios of these decay channels is given using a wide scan over the parameter space. The fact that R-parity is violated in this theory by a vacuum expectation value of a sneutrino links these branching ratios directly to the neutrino mass hierarchy. It is shown how a discovery of bottom-charged lepton events at the LHC can potentially determine whether the neutrino masses are in a normal or inverted hierarchy, as well as determining the theta_23 neutrino mixing angle.

Star-forming complexes are identified as bright lumps in B-band galaxy images and isolated by means of the unsharp-masking method. For the sample as a whole the radial number distribution of bright lumps largely traces the underlying exponential-disk light profiles, but peaks at a 10 percent smaller scale length. Moreover, the presence of a tail of star forming regions out to at least six optical scale lengths provides evidence against a systematic star formation truncation within that galaxy extension. Considering these findings, we apply a scale length-independent concentration index, taking into account the implied non-uniform random spread of star formation regions throughout the disk. The number profiles frequently manifest a second, minor peak at about two scale lengths. Relying on a two-dimensional stochastic self-propagating star formation model, we show these secondary peaks to be consistent with triggered star formation; for a few of the brighter galaxies a peculiar peak distribution is observed that is conceivably due to the onset of shear provided by differential rotation. On scales between 100 and 1000 pc, and by taking into account exponential-disk structure, bright lumps reveal cluster dimensions between 1.3 and 2, with a weak trend to higher dimensions for brighter galaxies. Interpreting cluster dimension in terms of porosity of a self-similar intragalactic medium, we derive a relation between current star formation rate, scale length, and porosity."

        "Abstract": "Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried out to study the critical behavior in a submonolayer lattice-gas of interacting monomers adsorbed on one-dimensional channels arranged in a triangular cross-sectional structure. The model mimics a nanoporous environment, where each nanotube or unit cell is represented by a one-dimensional array. Two kinds of lateral interaction energies have been considered: $1)$ $w_L$, interaction energy between nearest-neighbor particles adsorbed along a single channel and $2)$ $w_T$, interaction energy between particles adsorbed across nearest-neighbor channels. For $w_L/w_T=0$ and $w_T > 0$, successive planes are uncorrelated, the system is equivalent to the triangular lattice and the well-known $(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})$ $[(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})^*]$ ordered phase is found at low temperatures and a coverage, $\\theta$, of 1/3 $[2/3]$. In the more general case ($w_L/w_T \\neq 0$ and $w_T > 0$), a competition between interactions along a single channel and a transverse coupling between sites in neighboring channels allows to evolve to a three-dimensional adsorbed layer. Consequently, the $(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})$ and $(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3})^*$ structures \"propagate\" along the channels and new ordered phases appear in the adlayer. The Monte Carlo technique was combined with the recently reported Free Energy Minimization Criterion Approach (FEMCA), to predict the critical temperatures of the order-disorder transformation. The excellent qualitative agreement between simulated data and FEMCA results allow us to interpret the physical meaning of the mechanisms underlying the observed transitions."

        "Title": "Fluctuations of the Retarded Van der Waals Force",
        "Abstract": "The retarded Van der Waals force between a polarizable particle and a perfectly conducting plate is re-examined. The expression for this force given by Casimir and Polder represents a mean force, but there are large fluctuations around this mean value on short time scales which are of the same order of magnitude as the mean force itself. However, these fluctuations occur on time scales which are typically of the order of the light travel time between the atom and the plate. As a consequence, they will not be observed in an experiment which measures the force averaged over a much longer time. In the large time limit, the magnitude of the mean squared velocity of a test particle due to this fluctuating Van der Waals force approaches a constant, and is similar to a Brownian motion of a test particle in an thermal bath with an effective temperature. However the fluctuations are not isotropic in this case, and the shift in the mean square velocity components can even be negative. We interpret this negative shift to correspond to a reduction in the velocity spread of a wavepacket. The force fluctuations discussed in this paper are special case of the more general problem of stress tensor fluctuations. These are of interest in a variety of areas fo physics, including gravity theory. Thus the effects of Van der Waals force fluctuations serve as a useful model for better understanding quantum effects in gravity theory."

Two-particle spectroscopic factors derived from Monte Carlo Shell Model calculations are used, together with the sequential description of the two-particle transfer reaction mechanism. The calculation shows a clear signature for a shape phase transition between $^{98}$Zr and $^{100}$Zr, which displays coexistence of a deformed ground state with an excited spherical $0^+$ state. Furthermore, we show that there is a qualitative difference with respect to the case of a normal shape phase transition that can be discriminated with two-neutron transfer reactions."

The source flared with a peak of at least 80 mJy in March 2004. The source was resolved by the Very Large Array into two components with a separation of ~0.7 arcsec and characteristic sizes of ~0.2 arcsec. The two components of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1 +/- 0.1. We detect an upper limit to the proper motion of the Eastern component of ~3 x 10^3 km s^-1 relative to Sgr A*. We detect a proper motion of ~10^4 km s^-1 for the Western component relative to Sgr A*. The transient was also detected at X-ray wavelengths with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton telescope and given the designation CXOGC J174540.0-290031. The X-ray source falls in between the two radio components. The maximum luminosity of the X-ray source is ~10^36 erg s^-1, significantly sub-Eddington. The radio jet flux density predicted by the X-ray/radio correlation for X-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less than the measured flux density. We conclude that the radio transient is the result of a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the X-ray source and interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the Galactic Center."

Spectral graph theory provides a set of useful techniques and models for understanding `patterns of interconnectedness' in a graph. Our prime focus in this paper is on the following question: Is there a unified explanation and description of the fundamental spectral graph methods? There are at least two reasons to be interested in this question. Firstly, to gain a much deeper and refined understanding of the basic foundational principles, and secondly, to derive rich consequences with practical significance for algorithm design. However, despite half a century of research, this question remains one of the most formidable open issues, if not the core problem in modern network science. The achievement of this paper is to take a step towards answering this question by discovering a simple, yet universal statistical logic of spectral graph analysis. The prescribed viewpoint appears to be good enough to accommodate almost all existing spectral graph techniques as a consequence of just one single formalism and algorithm."

A key applied issue is thus the design of algorithms able to generalize on a new distribution, for which we have no label information. We focus on learning classification models defined as a weighted majority vote over a set of real-val ued functions. In this context, Germain et al. (2013) have shown that a measure of disagreement between these functions is crucial to control. The core of this measure is a theoretical bound--the C-bound (Lacasse et al., 2007)--which involves the disagreement and leads to a well performing majority vote learning algorithm in usual non-adaptative supervised setting: MinCq. In this work, we propose a framework to extend MinCq to a domain adaptation scenario. This procedure takes advantage of the recent perturbed variation divergence between distributions proposed by Harel and Mannor (2012). Justified by a theoretical bound on the target risk of the vote, we provide to MinCq a target sample labeled thanks to a perturbed variation-based self-labeling focused on the regions where the source and target marginals appear similar. We also study the influence of our self-labeling, from which we deduce an original process for tuning the hyperparameters. Finally, our framework called PV-MinCq shows very promising results on a rotation and translation synthetic problem."

Here we study the interplay between these two strategies, for a diffusing particle in an one-dimensional trapping potential $V(x)$, being randomly reset at a constant rate $r$. Stochastic resetting has been of great interest as it is known to provide an \"optimal rate\" ($r_*$) at which the mean first passage time is a minimum. On the other hand an attractive potential also assists in first capture process. Interestingly, we find that for a sufficiently strong external potential, the advantageous optimal resetting rate vanishes (i.e. $r_*\\to 0$). We derive a condition for this $optimal$ $resetting$ $rate$ $vanishing$ $transition$, which is continuous. We study this problem for various functional forms of $V(x)$, some analytically, and the rest numerically. We find that the optimal rate $r_*$ vanishes with the deviation from critical strength of the potential as a power law with an exponent $\\beta$ which appears to be universal."

In this work, we study the setting in which an agent must learn to generate programs for diverse scenes conditioned on a given symbolic instruction. Final goals are specified to our agent via images of the scenes. A symbolic instruction consistent with the goal images is used as the conditioning input for our policies. Since a single instruction corresponds to a diverse set of different but still consistent end-goal images, the agent needs to learn to generate a distribution over programs given an instruction. We demonstrate that with simple changes to the reinforced adversarial learning objective, we can learn instruction conditioned policies to achieve the corresponding diverse set of goals. Most importantly, our agent's stochastic policy is shown to more accurately capture the diversity in the goal distribution than a fixed pixel-based reward function baseline. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two domains: (1) drawing MNIST digits with a paint software conditioned on instructions and (2) constructing scenes in a 3D editor that satisfies a certain instruction."

EIT and slow light are achieved by shining a strong, resonant ``pump'' laser on the atomic medium, which allows slow and unattenuated propagation of a weaker ``signal'' beam, but only when a two-photon resonance condition is satisfied. Our wideband architecture is accomplished by dispersing a wideband signal spatially, transverse to the propagation direction, prior to entering the atomic cell. When particular Zeeman sub-levels are used in the EIT system, then one can introduce a magnetic field with a linear gradient such that the two-photon resonance condition is satisfied for each individual frequency component. Because slow light is a group velocity effect, utilizing differential phase shifts across the spectrum of a light pulse, one must then introduce a slight mismatch from perfect resonance to induce a delay. We present a model which accounts for diffusion of the atoms in the varying magnetic field as well as interaction with levels outside the ideal three-level system on which EIT is based. We find the maximum delay-bandwidth product decreases with bandwidth, and that delay-bandwidth product ~1 should be achievable with bandwidth ~50 MHz (~5 ns delay). This is a large improvement over the ~1 MHz bandwidths in conventional slow light systems and could be of use in signal processing applications."

We consider the case with a spatially constant intrinsic surface capacitance where the net flow rate is in general zero while harmonic rolls as well as time-averaged vortex-like components may exist depending on the spatial symmetry and extension of the surface potential. In general the system displays a resonance behavior at a frequency corresponding to the inverse RC time of the system. Different surface potentials share the common feature that the resonance frequency is inversely proportional to the characteristic length scale of the surface potential. For the asymptotic frequency dependence above resonance we find a 1/omega^2 power law for surface potentials with either an even or an odd symmetry. Below resonance we also find a power law omega^alpha with alpha being positive and dependent of the properties of the surface potential. Comparing a tanh potential and a sech potential we qualitatively find the same slip velocity, but for the below-resonance frequency response the two potentials display different power law asymptotics with alpha=1 and alpha~2, respectively."

Given a black-box classifier, we aim to eliminate the performance gap by perturbing the distribution of input variables for the disadvantaged group. We refer to the perturbed distribution as a counterfactual distribution, and characterize its properties for common fairness criteria. We introduce a descent algorithm to learn a counterfactual distribution from data. We then discuss how the estimated distribution can be used to build a data preprocessor that can reduce disparate impact without training a new model. We validate our approach through experiments on real-world datasets, showing that it can repair different forms of disparity without a significant drop in accuracy."

We give a proof of a formula of Frenkel and Zhu for fusion rules. We also give the analogue of the ``Hom''-functor of classical Lie algebra theory for vertex operator algebra theory by introducing a notion of ``generalized intertwining operator.'' We prove that the space of generalized intertwining operators from one module to another for a vertex operator algebra is a generalized module. From this result we derive a general form of Tsuchiya and Kanie's ``nuclear democracy theorem'' for any rational vertex operator algebra. This proves that the fusion rules obtained from our construction of tensor products are the same as the fusion rules obtained by using Tsuchiya and Kanie's method, for both WZW models and minimal models. We prove that if $V$ satisfies certain ``finiteness'' and ``semisimplicity'' conditions, then there exists a unique maximal submodule inside the generalized module. Furthermore, we prove that this maximal submodule is isomorphic to the contragredient module of a certain tensor product module. This gives another construction of tensor product modules and this result turns out to be closely related to Huang and Lepowsky's construction."

        "Abstract": "The problem of the one dimensional electro-diffusion of ions in a strong binary electrolyte is considered. In such a system the solute dissociates completely into two species of ions with unlike charges. The mathematical description consists of a diffusion equation for each species augmented by transport due to a self consistent electrostatic field determined by the Poisson equation. This mathematical framework also describes other important problems in physics such as electron and hole diffusion across semi-conductor junctions and the diffusion of ions in plasmas. If concentrations do not vary appreciably over distances of the order of the Debye length, the Poisson equation can be replaced by the condition of local charge neutrality first introduced by Planck. It can then be shown that both species diffuse at the same rate with a common diffusivity that is intermediate between that of the slow and fast species (ambipolar diffusion). Here we derive a more general theory by exploiting the ratio of Debye length to a characteristic length scale as a small asymptotic parameter. It is shown that the concentration of either species may be described by a nonlinear integro-differential equation which replaces the classical linear equation for ambipolar diffusion but reduces to it in the appropriate limit. Through numerical integration of the full set of equations it is shown that this nonlinear equation provides a better approximation to the exact solution than the linear equation it replaces."

        "Title": "Mass-Generation by Weyl-Symmetry Breaking",
        "Abstract": "A massless electroweak theory for leptons is formulated in a Weyl space, W_4, yielding a Weyl invariant gauge dynamics allowing for conformal rescalings of the metric and all fields with nonvanishing Weyl weight together with the corresponding transformations of the Weyl vector fields representing the D(1) or dilatation gauge fields. To study the appearance of nonzero masses this theory is explicitly broken by a term in the Lagrangean involving the curvature scalar R of the W_4 and a mass term for the scalar field. Thereby also the gauge fields as well as the charged fermion field acquire a mass as in the standard electroweak theory. The symmetry breaking is governed by the relation D Phi^2=0, where Phi is the modulus of the scalar field and D denotes the Weyl-covariant derivative. This true symmetry reduction, establishing a scale of length in the theory, is compared to the so-called spontanous symmetry breaking in the standard electroweak theory which is, actually, the choice of a particular (nonlinear) gauge obtained by adopting an origin in the coset space representing the scalar field which is invariant under the electromagnetic gauge group. Particular attention is devoted to the appearance of Einstein's equations for the metric after the Weyl-symmetry breaking yielding a pseudo-Riemannian space V_4 from a W_4 and a scalar field with a constant modulus which in turn affects Einstein's gravitational constant in a manner comparable to the Brans-Dicke theory."

        "Abstract": "Fashion is a unique domain for developing recommender systems (RS). Personalization is critical to fashion users. As a result, highly accurate recommendations are not sufficient unless they are also specific to users. Moreover, fashion data is characterized by a large majority of new users, so a recommendation strategy that performs well only for users with prior interaction history is a poor fit to the fashion problem. Critical to addressing these issues in fashion recommendation is an evaluation strategy that: 1) includes multiple metrics that are relevant to fashion, and 2) is performed within segments of users with different interaction histories. Here, we present our multifaceted offline strategy for evaluating fashion RS. Using our proposed evaluation methodology, we compare the performance of three different algorithms, a most popular (MP) items strategy, a collaborative filtering (CF) strategy, and a content-based (CB) strategy. We demonstrate that only by considering the performance of these algorithms across multiple metrics and user segments can we determine the extent to which each algorithm is likely to fulfill fashion users' needs."

A shortcoming of the various definitions of recursive functions lies in the fact that it is not a matter of a syntactical check to find out if an entity gives rise to a function. Eight new ideas for a precise setup of arithmetical logic and its metalanguage give the proper environment for the construction of a special computer, the ARBACUS computer. Computers do not come to a necessary halt; it is requested that calculators are constructed on the basis of computers in a way that they always come to a halt, then all calculations are effective. The ARBATOR is defined as a calculator with two-layer-computation. It allows for the calculation of all primitive recursive functions, but multi-level-arbation also allows for the calculation of other arbative functions that are not primitive recursive. The new paradigm of calculation does not have the above mentioned shortcoming. The defenders of Church's thesis are challenged to show that exotic arbative functions are recursive and to put forward a recursive function that is not arbative. A construction with three-tier-multi-level-arbation that includes a diagonalisation leads to the extravagant yet calculable Snark-function that is not arbative. As long as it is not shown that all exotic arbative functions and particularily the Snark-function are arithmetically representable Goedel's first incompleteness sentence is in limbo."

        "Abstract": "In many contexts the modal properties of a structure change, either due to the impact of a changing environment, fatigue, or due to the presence of structural damage. For example during flight, an aircraft's modal properties are known to change with both altitude and velocity. It is thus important to quantify these changes given only a truncated set of modal data, which is usually the case experimentally. This procedure is formally known as the generalised inverse eigenvalue problem. In this paper we experimentally show that first-order gradient-based methods that optimise objective functions defined over a modal are prohibitive due to the required small step sizes. This in turn leads to the justification of using a non-gradient, black box optimiser in the form of particle swarm optimisation. We further show how it is possible to solve such inverse eigenvalue problems in a lower dimensional space by the use of random projections, which in many cases reduces the total dimensionality of the optimisation problem by 80% to 99%. Two example problems are explored involving a ten-dimensional mass-stiffness toy problem, and a one-dimensional finite element mass-stiffness approximation for a Boeing 737-300 aircraft."

We pose it as a property estimation problem, and study the fundamental trade-offs involved in the accuracy in estimated privacy guarantees and the number of samples required. We introduce a novel estimator that uses polynomial approximation of a carefully chosen degree to optimally trade-off bias and variance. With $n$ samples, we show that this estimator achieves performance of a straightforward plug-in estimator with $n \\ln n$ samples, a phenomenon referred to as effective sample size amplification. The minimax optimality of the proposed estimator is proved by comparing it to a matching fundamental lower bound."

In order to answer this question, we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position of a black hole shadow casted by a rotating black hole on an optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of a black hole. We have found black hole shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely different black hole spin parameters and a same black hole mass. Thus, it is practically difficult to determine a spin parameter of a black hole from a size and a shape of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk. We newly introduce a bisector axis of a black hole shadow named a shadow axis. For a rotating black hole a shape and a position of a black hole shadow are not symmetric with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole shadow. So, in this case the minimum interval between a mass center of a black hole and a shadow axis is finite. An extent of this minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of a black hole for a fixed inclination angle between a rotation axis of a black hole and a direction of an observer. In order to measure a spin parameter of a black hole, if a shadow axis is determined observationally, it is crucially important to determine a position of a mass center of a black hole in a region of a black hole shadow."

Furthermore, imperfections may cause devices to malfunction with some fixed probability when sensing the channel, which amounts to deducing a noisy received transmission. Such noisy networks have implications for ultra-lightweight sensor networks and biological systems.   We show how to compute tasks in a noise-resilient manner over noisy beeping networks of arbitrary structure. In particular, we transform any algorithm that assumes a noiseless beeping network (of size $n$) into a noise-resilient version while incurring a multiplicative overhead of only $O(\\log n)$ in its round complexity, with high probability. We show that our coding is optimal for some tasks, such as node-coloring of a clique.   We further show how to simulate a large family of algorithms designed for distributed networks in the CONGEST($B$) model over a noisy beeping network. The simulation succeeds with high probability and incurs an asymptotic multiplicative overhead of $O(B\\cdot \\Delta \\cdot \\min(n,\\Delta^2))$ in the round complexity, where $\\Delta$ is the maximal degree of the network. The overhead is tight for certain graphs, e.g., a clique. Further, this simulation implies a constant overhead coding for constant-degree networks."

        "Title": "Instantaneous Action at a Distance in a Holistic Universe",
        "Abstract": "The early work of Lorentz, Abraham and others, evolved through the work of Fokker, Dirac and others to ultimately culminate in the Feynman- Wheeler direct action at a distance theory. However this theory has encountered certain conceptual difficulties like non-locality in time, self force of the electron, pre acceleration and the perfect absorption condition of Feynman and Wheeler, that is the instantaneous action of the remaining charges in the universe on the charge in question. More recently, Hoyle and Narlikar have resurrected this theory, but within the context of a Steady State or Quasi Steady State cosmology. They argue that the theory infact has a better standing than the generally accepted quantum theoretic description. In this article we consider a quantum theoretic description and a cosmology which parallels the Hoyle-Narlikar approach. This leads to a synthesis and justification of the Dirac and Feynman-Wheeler approaches, clarifying the conceptual problems in the process. We deduce a scenario with quantized space-time and a holistic cosmology, consistent with physical and astrophysical data. The non-locality is now seen to be meaningful within the minimum space-time intervals, as also the perfect absorption within the holistic description. Local realism, and the usual causal field theory are seen to have an underpinning of direct action. For example this is brought out by the virtual photons which mediate interactions in Quantum Electro Dynamics, and the emergence of the inverse square law in the above approach from a background Zero Point Field."

We show that for two or more dimensions, the problem of predicting the cluster from a given set of paths is complete for the complexity class CC, the subset of P characterized by circuits composed of comparator gates. CC-completeness is believed to imply that, in the worst case, growing a cluster of size n requires polynomial time in n even on a parallel computer.   A parallel relaxation algorithm is presented that uses the fact that clusters are nearly spherical to guess the cluster from a given set of paths, and then corrects defects in the guessed cluster through a non-local annihilation process. The parallel running time of the relaxation algorithm for two-dimensional internal DLA is studied by simulating it on a serial computer. The numerical results are compatible with a running time that is either polylogarithmic in n or a small power of n. Thus the computational resources needed to grow large clusters are significantly less on average than the worst-case analysis would suggest.   For a parallel machine with k processors, we show that random clusters in d dimensions can be generated in O((n/k + log k) n^{2/d}) steps. This is a significant speedup over explicit sequential simulation, which takes O(n^{1+2/d}) time on average.   Finally, we show that in one dimension internal DLA can be predicted in O(log n) parallel time, and so is in the complexity class NC."

        "Abstract": "As a planet transits the face of a star, it accelerates along the line-of-sight. The changing delay in the propagation of photons produces an apparent deceleration of the planet across the sky throughout the transit. This persistent transverse deceleration breaks the time-reversal symmetry in the transit lightcurve of a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a perfectly symmetric star. For `hot Jupiter' systems, ingress advances at a higher rate than egress by a fraction of 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. Forthcoming space telescopes such as Kepler or COROT will reach the sensitivity required to detect this asymmetry. The scaling of the fractional asymmetry with stellar mass M and planetary orbital radius R as M/R^2 is different from the scaling of the orbital period as (M/R^3)^{-1/2}. Therefore, this effect constitutes a new method for a purely dynamical determination of the mass of the star, which is currently inferred indirectly with theoretical uncertainties based on spectral modeling. Radial velocity data for the reflex motion of the star can then be used to determine the planet's mass. Although orbital eccentricity could introduce a larger asymmetry than the light propagation delay, the eccentricity is expected to decay by tidal dissipation to negligible values for a close-in planet with no perturbing third body. Future detection of the eclipse of a planet's emission by its star could be used to measure the light propagation delay across the orbital diameter, 46.7(R/7x10^{11}cm) seconds, and also determine the stellar mass from the orbital period."

The dynamic renormalization group is applied to the stochastic growth equation using the Martin, Sigga, and Rose formalism. The periodic potential and the quenched disorder, upon averaging, are combined into a single term in the generating functional. Changing the temperature (or the inherent noise of the deposition process) two different regimes with a transition between them at $T_{sr}$, are found: for $T>T_{sr}$ this term is irrelevant and the surface has the scaling properties of a surface growing on a flat substrate in the rough phase. The height-height correlations behave as $C(L,\\tau)\\sim \\ln [L f(\\tau/L^2)]$. While the linear response mobility is finite in this phase it does vanish as $(T-T_{sr})^{1.78}$ when $T\\rightarrow T_{sr}^+$. For $T<T_{sr}$ there is a line of fixed-point for the coupling constant. The surface is super-rough: the equilibrium correlation functions behave as $(\\ln L)^2$ while their short time dependence is $(\\ln \\tau) ^2$ with a temperature dependent dynamic exponent $z=2[1+1.78(1-T/T_{sr})]$. While the linear response mobility vanishes on large length scales, its scale-dependence leads to a non-linear response.

The basic principle is to ignite a plasma using argon, and then to introduce a small additional nitrogen flow to achieve the nitridation of a Nb target. Subsequent sputtering leads to the deposition of NbN onto the host substrate. The characteristics of a sputtered film depend on a number of parameters: argon pressure, nitrogen flow rate and time-evolution profile, substrate material, etc. Crucially, the hysteresis in the target voltage as a function of the nitrogen flow can be used to provide a highly effective monitor of nitrogen consumption during the reactive process. By studying these dependencies we have been able to achieve highly reproducible film characteristics on sapphire, silicon dioxide on silicon, and silicon nitride on silicon. Intrinsic film stress was minimised by optimising the argon pressure, giving NbN films having Tc = 14.65 K. In the paper, we report characteristics such as deposition rate, Residual Resistance Ratio (RRR), film resistivity, transition temperature, and stress, as a function of deposition conditions.

Moreover, we present another approach to encoding endomorphisms on nets of Neumann algebras on the circle into half-sided modular inclusions. There is a natural way to associate a weight to a Moebius covariant endomorphism. The properties of this weight has been studied by Bertozzini, Conti and Longo. In this paper we show the converse, namely how to associate a Moebius covariant endomorphism to a given weight under certain assumptions, thus obtaining a correspondence between a class of weights on a half-sided modular inclusion and a subclass of the Moebius covariant endomorphisms on the associated net of von Neumann algebras. This allows us to treat Moebius covariant endomorphisms in terms of weights on half-sided modular inclusions. As our aim is to provide a framework for treating endomorphisms on nets of von Neumann algebras in terms of the apparently simpler objects of weights on half-sided modular inclusions, we lastly give some basic results for manipulations with such weights."

Such procedures, however, cannot be extended in a straightforward manner when a spacetime has multiple horizons. In particular, it is not clear whether there exists a notion of global temperature characterizing the multi-horizon spacetimes. We examine the conditions under which a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using the example of Schwarzschild-De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically extend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor, response of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for identifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the SDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart which covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a consistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS spacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two temperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS spacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational (c) Even when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal nature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate chart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other charts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures. The coordinate dependence of the thermal nature is reminiscent of the flat spacetime in Minkowski and Rindler coordinate charts. The implications are discussed."

        "Abstract": "The field of the Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 040827 was observed with XMM-Newton and with the ESO/VLT starting ~6 and ~12 hours after the burst, respectively. A fading X-ray afterglow is clearly detected with the XMM-Newton/EPIC instrument, with a time decay t^(-delta), with delta=1.41+/-0.10. Its spectrum is well described by a power law (photon index Gamma=2.3+/-0.1) affected by an absorption largely exceeding (by a factor ~5) the expected Galactic one, requiring the contribution of an intrinsic, redshifted absorber. In the optical/NIR range, the afterglow emission was observed in the Ks band, as a weak source superimposed to the host galaxy, with magnitude Ks=19.44+/-0.13 (12 hours after the GRB, contribution from the host subtracted); in other bands the flux is dominated by the host galaxy. Coupling constraints derived from X-ray spectral fitting and from photometry of the host, we estimated a gas column density in the range (0.4-2.6)x10^22 cm^-2 in the GRB host galaxy, likely located at a redshift 0.5<z<1.7. GRB 040827 stands out as the best example of an X-ray afterglow with intrinsic absorption."

Moreover, it shows that the first law of thermodynamics is still satisfied. We then discuss the phase structure and transition in both five and six dimensions. Specifically, we show that there always exist two regions in the parameter space. In one region, the system possesses one single phase. However in the other region, there could coexist three phases and a van der Waals-like phase transition occurs. Finally, we find that there is a fairly close resemblance in thermodynamic properties and phase structure of a Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell black hole, either in a cavity or in anti-de Sitter space."

        "Abstract": "We present simulations of the evolution of a proto-neutron star in which kaon-condensed matter might exist, including the effects of finite temperature and trapped neutrinos. The phase transition from pure nucleonic matter to the kaon condensate phase is described using Gibbs' rules for phase equilibrium, which permit the existence of a mixed phase. A general property of neutron stars containing kaon condensates, as well as other forms of strangeness, is that the maximum mass for cold, neutrino-free matter can be less than the maximum mass for matter containing trapped neutrinos or which has a finite entropy. A proto-neutron star formed with a baryon mass exceeding that of the maximum mass of cold, neutrino-free matter is therefore metastable, that is, it will collapse to a black hole at some time during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling stage.   The effects of kaon condensation on metastable stars are dramatic. In these cases, the neutrino signal from a hypothetical galactic supernova (distance $\\sim8.5$ kpc) will stop suddenly, generally at a level above the background in the SuperK and SNO detectors, which have low energy thresholds and backgrounds. This is in contrast to the case of a stable star, for which the signal exponentially decays, eventually disappearing into the background. We find the lifetimes of kaon-condensed metastable stars to be restricted to the range 40--70 s and weakly dependent on the proto-neutron star mass, in sharp contrast to the significantly larger mass dependence and range (1--100 s) of hyperon-rich metastable stars."

Although human learning makes seamless use of both learned perceptual features and instance recall, current generative learning paradigms only make use of one of these two components. Take, for instance, flow models, which learn a latent space of invertible features that follow a simple distribution. Conversely, kernel density techniques use instances to shift a simple distribution into an aggregate mixture model. Here we propose multiple methods to enhance the latent space of a flow model with neighborhood information. Not only does our proposed framework represent a more human-like approach by leveraging both learned features and memories, but it may also be viewed as a step forward in non-parametric methods. The efficacy of our model is shown empirically with standard image datasets. We observe compelling results and a significant improvement over baselines."

This problem covers the cases of the transport by the resonant photons in astrophysical gases and plasmas, heat transport by electromagnetic waves in plasmas, migration of predators, and other applications. We treat a model case of one-dimensional transport on a uniform background with a simple power-law step-length probability distribution function (PDF).

This result was obtained for most general spherically symmetric phase-space distribution functions consistent with a measured radial velocity dispersion. As a stability test of these predictions against a perturbation of the point mass potential, in this paper we make use of a representative of these functions to set the initial conditions for a simulation in a more realistic potential of similar mass and accounting for other observations. The predicted radial velocity dispersion profile evolves to forms still consistent with the measured profile, proving structural stability of the point mass approximation and the reliability of the resulting mass estimate of $2.1\\times10^{11}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within $150\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. We also find an interesting coincidence with the recent estimates based on the kinematics of the extended Orphan Stream.

If one also specifies a theory of gravity we can also determine the pressure, energy density, and equation of state of the dark energy as functions of redshift. We then apply this methodology on a modern data set of distances to Supernovae and to radio galaxies. We find that the universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration at a redshift of about 0.4, and the present value of deceleration parameter is -0.35 +/- 0.15. The standard ``concordance model'' provides a reasonably good fit to the dimensionless expansion rate as a function of redshift, though it fits the dimensionless acceleration rate as a function of redshift less well. Adopting General Relativity as the theory of gravity, we obtain the redshift trends for the pressure, energy density, and equation of state of the dark energy out to a redshift of about one. They are generally consistent with the concordance model, at least out to a redshift of about 0.5, but the existing data preclude any stronger conclusions at this point."

We utilized Brownian dynamics simulations to predict the translational and rotational fluctuations of a Janus sphere with a cap of non-matching density. The presence of the cap significantly impacted the rotational dynamics of the particle as a consequence of gravitational torque at experimentally relevant conditions. Gravitational torque dominated stochastic torque for a particle > 1 micrometer in diameter and with a 20 nm thick gold cap. Janus particles at these conditions sampled mostly cap-down or quenched orientations. Although the results summarized herein showed that particles of smaller diameter (< 1 micrometer) with a thin gold coating (< 5 nm) behave similar to an isotropic particle, small increases in either particle diameter or coating thickness drastically quenched the polar rotation of the particle. Histogram landscapes of the separation distance from the boundary and orientation observations of particles with larger diameters or thicker gold coatings were mostly populated with quenched configurations. Finally, the histogram landscapes were inverted to obtain the potential energy landscapes, providing a path for experimental data to be interpreted."

The precession of the test gyroscope gives the signatures of the general relativistic effects that are present in the region of strong gravity of an NS. Using a numerical code, we find the precession of the test gyroscope for a rotating and a strongly magnetized neutron star. The magnetic field distribution inside the neutron star is assumed either to be poloidal or toroidal. The overall spin precession rate is obtained by setting the orbital frequency of the gyroscope to a non-zero value but restricted to a time-like observer. The gyro frequency differs depending on the central object being a black hole or a neutron star. For neutron star, the gyro precession can even be calculated inside the star. We find that the gyroscope precession frequency depends on the stars mass, rotation rate, and magnetic field configuration."

The traffic dynamics are governed by a macroscopic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model, consisting of $2\\times 2$ nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for traffic density and velocity. The boundary actuation of traffic flow is implemented with ramp-metering, which is a common approach to freeway congestion management. We use a discretized ARZ PDE model to describe the macroscopic freeway traffic environment for a stretch of freeway, and apply deep RL to develop continuous control on the outlet boundary. The control objective is to achieve $L^2$ norm regulation of the traffic state to a spatially uniform density and velocity. A recently developed neural network based policy gradient algorithm is employed, called proximal policy optimization. For comparison, we also consider an open-loop controller and a PDE backstepping approach. The backstepping controller is a model-based approach recently developed by the co-authors. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the RL approach nearly recovers the control performance of the model-based PDE backstepping approach, despite no \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the traffic flow dynamics."

Our code uses a dual-null formulation for spherically symmetric space-time integration, and the numerical range covers both universes connected by the wormhole. We observe that the wormhole is unstable against Gaussian pulses in either exotic or normal massless Klein-Gordon fields. The wormhole throat suffers a bifurcation of horizons and either explodes to form an inflationary universe or collapses to a black hole, if the total input energy is respectively negative or positive. As the perturbations become small in total energy, there is evidence for critical solutions with a certain black-hole mass or Hubble constant. The collapse time is related to the initial energy with an apparently universal critical exponent. For normal matter, such as a traveller traversing the wormhole, collapse to a black hole always results. However, carefully balanced additional ghost radiation can maintain the wormhole for a limited time. The black-hole formation from a traversible wormhole confirms the recently proposed duality between them. The inflationary case provides a mechanism for inflating, to macroscopic size, a Planck-sized wormhole formed in space-time foam."

It can be considered a generalization of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm (SGD), where instead of updating the weight vector along the negative direction of the stochastic gradient, the update is performed in a \"mirror domain\" defined by the gradient of a (strictly convex) potential function. This potential function, and the mirror domain it yields, provides considerable flexibility in the algorithm compared to SGD. While many properties of SMD have already been obtained in the literature, in this paper we exhibit a new interpretation of SMD, namely that it is a risk-sensitive optimal estimator when the unknown weight vector and additive noise are non-Gaussian and belong to the exponential family of distributions. The analysis also suggests a modified version of SMD, which we refer to as symmetric SMD (SSMD). The proofs rely on some simple properties of Bregman divergence, which allow us to extend results from quadratics and Gaussians to certain convex functions and exponential families in a rather seamless way."

The method is model-independent and relies on variations between the observed spectra. The projections (PC1,PC2) reveal a difference with respect to environment, with a wider range in PC1 and PC2 in the group sample. We define a spectral parameter (zeta=0.36PC1-PC2) which simplifies this result to a single number: field galaxies have a very similar value of zeta, whereas HCG galaxies span a wide range in this parameter. We obtain a strong correlation between the values of zeta and the mass fraction in younger stars, so that some group galaxies present a higher fraction of them. PCA is more sensitive than other methods based on a direct analysis of observables such as the structure of the surface brightness profile or the equivalent width of absorption lines. The latter do not reveal any significant variation between field and compact group galaxies. Our results imply that the presence of young stars only amounts to a fraction of a percent in its contribution to the total variance."

In order to include all the relevant physical ingredients (2-body relaxation, stellar mass spectrum, collisions, tidal disruption,...), we chose to revive a numerical scheme pioneered by Henon in the 70's. It is basically a Monte Carlo resolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. It can cope with any stellar mass spectrum or velocity distribution. Being a particle-based method, it also allows one to take stellar collisions into account in a very realistic way. This first paper covers the basic version of our code which treats the relaxation-driven evolution of stellar cluster without a central BH. A technical description of the code is presented, as well as the results of test computations. Thanks to the use of a binary tree to store potential and rank information and of variable time steps, cluster models with up to 2 million particles can be simulated on a standard personal computer and the CPU time required scales as N*ln(N) with the particle number N. Furthermore, the number of simulated stars needs not be equal to N but can be arbitrarily larger. A companion paper will treat further physical ingredients, mostly relevant to galactic nuclei."

Specifically, we train a RNN on positive and negative examples from a regular language, and ask if there is a simple decoding function that maps states of this RNN to states of the minimal deterministic finite automaton (MDFA) for the language. Our experiments show that such a decoding function indeed exists, and that it maps states of the RNN not to MDFA states, but to states of an {\\em abstraction} obtained by clustering small sets of MDFA states into \"superstates\". A qualitative analysis reveals that the abstraction often has a simple interpretation. Overall, the results suggest a strong structural relationship between internal representations used by RNNs and finite automata, and explain the well-known ability of RNNs to recognize formal grammatical structure."

We study Ramsey problems for Berge copies of graphs, i.e. the smallest number of vertices of a complete $r$-uniform hypergraph, such that if we color the hyperedges with $c$ colors, there is a monochromatic Berge copy of $G$.   We obtain a couple results regarding these problems. In particular, we determine for which $r$ and $c$ the Ramsey number can be super-linear. We also show a new way to obtain lower bounds, and improve the general lower bounds by a large margin. In the specific case $G=K_n$ and $r=2c-1$, we obtain an upper bound that is sharp besides a constant term, improving earlier results."

        "Title": "Strategy Improvement for Concurrent Reachability and Safety Games",
        "Abstract": "We consider concurrent games played on graphs. At every round of a game, each player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly determine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the safety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the reachability objective to reach a given set of states. First, we present a simple proof of the fact that in concurrent reachability games, for all $\\epsilon>0$, memoryless $\\epsilon$-optimal strategies exist. A memoryless strategy is independent of the history of plays, and an $\\epsilon$-optimal strategy achieves the objective with probability within $\\epsilon$ of the value of the game. In contrast to previous proofs of this fact, our proof is more elementary and more combinatorial. Second, we present a strategy-improvement (a.k.a.\\ policy-iteration) algorithm for concurrent games with reachability objectives. We then present a strategy-improvement algorithm for concurrent games with safety objectives. Our algorithms yield sequences of player-1 strategies which ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the game. Our result is significant because the strategy-improvement algorithm for safety games provides, for the first time, a way to approximate the value of a concurrent safety game from below. Previous methods could approximate the values of these games only from one direction, and as no rates of convergence are known, they did not provide a practical way to solve these games."

        "Abstract": "Major chip manufacturers have all introduced Multithreaded processors. These processors are used for running a variety of workloads. Efficient resource utilization is an important design aspect in such processors. Depending on the workload, mis-speculated execution can severely impact resource utilization and power utilization. In general, compared to a uniprocessor, a multithreaded processor may have better tolerance towards mis-speculation. However there can still be phases where even a multi-threaded processor performance may get impacted by branch induced mis-speculation. In this paper I propose monitoring the branch predictor behavior of various hardware threads running on the multi-threaded processor and use that information as a feedback to the thread arbiter/picker which schedules the next thread to fetch instructions from. If I find that a particular thread is going through a phase where it is consistently mis-predicting its branches and its average branch misprediction stall is above a specific threshold then I temporarily reduce the priority for picking that thread. I do a qualitative comparison of various solutions to the problem of resource inefficiency caused due to mis-speculated branches in multithreaded processors. This work can be extended by doing a quantitative evaluation."

        "Abstract": "(substantial changes to section 3.2, otherwise minor) We present an analysis of the hydrodynamic stability of a cold slab bounded by two accretion shocks. Previous numerical work has shown that when the Mach number of the shock is large the slab is unstable. Here we show that to linear order both the bending and breathing modes of such a slab are stable. However, nonlinear effects will tend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab displacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear instability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for small bending angles, is $\\sim c_sk (k\\eta)^{1/2}$, where $\\eta$ is the slab displacement. When the bending angle is large the slab will contain a local vorticity comparable to $c_s/L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. We discuss the implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs. Finally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock and a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case is stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a nonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock bounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce substructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the sound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab thickness."

On the introduction of slave bosons, the $t-J$ model at a finite hole doping can be written in the form of $U(1)$ gauge theories. After a duality transformation, they can be written as a generalized $BF$ theory, in which the higher-form symmetries are more manifest. We identify the emergent continuous and discrete higher-form symmetries in both $s-wave$ and $d-wave$ superconducting phases, expected to be realized from a doped Mott insulator. The existence of a topological order is tested by examining if there is a spontaneously broken discrete one-form symmetry. We claim that a spontaneous breaking of discrete one-form symmetry may extend to a phase that has massless Dirac fermions in the limit of large number of flavors. We discuss the possibility of a topological phase transition inside the superconducting dome of high $T_{c}$ cuprates."

We present the relation between the Kleinert's model of a crystal with defects and Plebanski's theory of gravity. We have considered the translational defects - dislocations, and the rotational defects - disclinations - in the 3- and 4-dimensional crystals. The 4-dimensional crystalline defects present the Riemann-Cartan spacetime which has an additional geometric property - \"torsion\" - connected with dislocations. The world crystal is a model for the gravitation which has a new type of gauge symmetry: the Einstein's gravitation has a zero torsion as a special gauge, while a zero connection is another equivalent gauge with nonzero torsion which corresponds to the Einstein's theory of \"teleparallelism\". Any intermediate choice of the gauge with nonzero connection A^{IJ}_\\mu is also allowed. In the present investigation we show that in the Plebanski formulation the phase of gravity with torsion is equivalent to the ordinary or topological gravity, and we can exclude a torsion as a separate dynamical variable."

        "Abstract": "Competitions can occur on an absolute scale, to be faster or more efficient, or they can occur on a relative scale, to \"beat\" one's competitor in a zero-sum game. Ecological models have focused on absolute competitions, in which optima exist. Classic evolutionary models such as the Wright-Fisher model, as well as more recent models of travelling waves, have focused on purely relative competitions, in which fitness continues to increase indefinitely, without actually progressing anywhere. This manuscript proposes a new way to describe both at the same time. It begins with a revised version of r/K-selection theory. r continues to describe maximum reproductive speed, but the new version of K, with a different subscript, now describes parsimoniousness in territory use, a group-selected, anti-tragedy-of-the-commons trait. A third dimension c of fitness is then added to this novel system, one which is unitless and normalized, and hence capable of capturing the population genetics concept w of a strictly relative, genetically-limited competitive race. MacArthur's original version of r/K-selection theory is shown to confound parsimoniousness K with competitive ability c, despite the fact that available data suggests a negative correlation between the two; here they are disentangled. A rotation of the resulting three-dimensional system provides a population genetic underpinning for Grime's universal adaptive strategy theory of ruderals (selected for high r), stress tolerators (selected for a combination of high r and high K), and competitors (selected for a combination of high r and high c)."

The reliability of an edge is the probability that no failure occurs on that edge, whereas the reliability of a path is the product of the reliabilities of the edges in such path. The problem has relevant applications in the design of networks, in fields such as telecommunications, electricity and transports. For its solution, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model, and an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic which invokes several shaking and local search operators. Extensive computational tests prove that the metaheuristic can provide good quality solutions in very short computing times."

        "Abstract": "We study the distribution of bright star-forming complexes in a homogeneous sample of 72 late-type (``irregular'') dwarf galaxies located within the 10 Mpc volume. Star-forming complexes are identified as bright lumps in B-band galaxy images and isolated by means of the unsharp-masking method. For the sample as a whole the radial number distribution of bright lumps largely traces the underlying exponential-disk light profiles, but peaks at a 10 percent smaller scale length. Moreover, the presence of a tail of star forming regions out to at least six optical scale lengths provides evidence against a systematic star formation truncation within that galaxy extension. Considering these findings, we apply a scale length-independent concentration index, taking into account the implied non-uniform random spread of star formation regions throughout the disk. The number profiles frequently manifest a second, minor peak at about two scale lengths. Relying on a two-dimensional stochastic self-propagating star formation model, we show these secondary peaks to be consistent with triggered star formation; for a few of the brighter galaxies a peculiar peak distribution is observed that is conceivably due to the onset of shear provided by differential rotation. On scales between 100 and 1000 pc, and by taking into account exponential-disk structure, bright lumps reveal cluster dimensions between 1.3 and 2, with a weak trend to higher dimensions for brighter galaxies. Interpreting cluster dimension in terms of porosity of a self-similar intragalactic medium, we derive a relation between current star formation rate, scale length, and porosity."

        "Abstract": "A self-consistent, adiabatic model for the {\\it long-time} behaviour of tidal capture binaries is presented. It is shown that most capture orbits behave chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the values of $\\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron separation at capture.   If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly bound, highly eccentric phase.   If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.   We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \\& Paczy\\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\\odot$.

Although human learning makes seamless use of both learned perceptual features and instance recall, current generative learning paradigms only make use of one of these two components. Take, for instance, flow models, which learn a latent space of invertible features that follow a simple distribution. Conversely, kernel density techniques use instances to shift a simple distribution into an aggregate mixture model. Here we propose multiple methods to enhance the latent space of a flow model with neighborhood information. Not only does our proposed framework represent a more human-like approach by leveraging both learned features and memories, but it may also be viewed as a step forward in non-parametric methods. The efficacy of our model is shown empirically with standard image datasets. We observe compelling results and a significant improvement over baselines."

Bulk Comptonization of disc photons is shown to yield a spectral component contributing in the far UV band, and would then be currently unobservable. On the contrary, the bulk Comptonization of broad line photons may yield a significant feature in the soft X-ray band. Such a feature is time-dependent and transient, and dominates over the non thermal continuum only when: a) the dissipation occurs close to, but within, the broad line region; b) other competing processes, like the synchrotron self-Compton emission, yield a negligible flux in the X-ray band. The presence of a bulk Compton component may account for the X-ray properties of high redshift blazars that show a flattening (and possibly a hump) in the soft X-rays, previously interpreted as due to intrinsic absorption. We discuss why the conditions leading to a detectable bulk Compton feature might be met only occasionally in high redshift blazars, concluding that the absence of such a feature in the spectra of most blazars should not be taken as evidence against matter--dominated relativistic jets. The detection of such a component carries key information on the bulk Lorentz factor and kinetic energy associated to (cold) leptons."

Here, we demonstrate that the decay and revival of the Loschmidt echo follows power-law scaling in the system size and the distance from a critical point with equilibrium critical exponents. We reveal such dynamical scaling laws by analyzing relevant perturbations to the Loschmidt echo cast in a scaling invariant form. We confirm the validity and the generality of the predicted dynamical scaling laws with a diverse range of critical models such as Ising spin models with a short and long range interaction, a finite-component system phase transition, and a topological phase transition. Moreover, using the integrability of systems in the thermodynamic limit, we derive such scaling laws analytically from a microscopic analysis. Our finding promotes the Loschmidt echo to a quantitative non-equilibrium probe of criticality and allows for quantitative predictions on the role of criticality on various physical scenarios where the Loschmidt echo is central to describing non-equilibrium dynamics."

We suggest that the error may have its source in a non relativistic intuition that imagines the Universe not as a spacetime but separates space from time and pictures the cosmological expansion as space evolving in time. The physical reality, however, is fundamentally different -- the expanding Universe is necessarily a curved spacetime. We show here that the fact that the spacetime is curved implies that the interpretation of the observed cosmological redshift as being due to the expansion of the cosmological 3D--space is observationally verifiable. Thus it is impossible to mimic the true cosmological redshift by a Doppler effect caused by motion of galaxies in a non-expanding 3D-space, flat or curved. We summarize our points in simple spacetime diagrams that illustrate a gedanken experiment distinguishing between expansion of space and pure kinematics. We also provide all relevant mathematics. None of the previously published discussions of the issue, including a recent popular Scientific American article, offered a similarly clear way out of the confusion."

Clustering is a technique to reduce the number of comparison needed to find similar pairs in a set of $n$ elements such as protein sequences. Precise clustering ensures that each pair of similar elements appears together in at least one cluster, so that similarities can be identified by all-to-all comparison in each cluster rather than on the full set. This paper introduces ClusterMerge, a new algorithm for precise clustering that uses transitive relationships among the elements to enable parallel and scalable implementations of this approach. We apply ClusterMerge to the important problem of finding similar amino acid sequences in a collection of proteins. ClusterMerge identifies 99.8% of similar pairs found by a full $O(n^2)$ comparison, with only half as many operations. More importantly, ClusterMerge is highly amenable to parallel and distributed computation. Our implementation achieves a speedup of 604$\\times$ on 768 cores (1400$\\times$ faster than a comparable single-threaded clustering implementation), a strong scaling efficiency of 90%, and a weak scaling efficiency of nearly 100%."

The control of the coherent dynamics is elucidated for the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT), i.e., the coherent dynamics of a driven two-level atom in a quantum superposition state can be brought practically to a complete standstill. We study this phenomenon for different initial preparations of the two-level atom. We then proceed to investigate the decoherence originating from the interaction of the two-level atom with a lossy cavity mode. The loss mechanism is described in terms of a microscopic model that couples the cavity mode to a bath of harmonic field modes. A suitably tuned external cw-laser field applied to the two-level atom slows down considerably the decoherence of the atom. We demonstrate the suppression of decoherence for two opposite initial preparations of the atomic state: a quantum superposition state as well as the ground state. These findings can be used to the effect of a proficient battling of decoherence in qubit manipulation processes."

Two main regimes have been discussed, {\\it hydromagnetic outflows}, which have a significant mass flux and have energy and angular momentum carried by both the matter and the electromagnetic field and, Poynting outflows, where the mass flux is negligible and energy and angular momentum are carried predominantly by the electromagnetic field. Here we consider a Keplerian disk initially threaded by a dipole-like magnetic field and we present solutions of the force-free Grad-Shafranov equation for the coronal plasma. We find solutions with Poynting jets where there is a continuous outflow of energy and toroidal magnetic flux from the disk into the external space. This behavior contradicts the commonly accepted ``theorem'' of Solar plasma physics that the motion of the footpoints of a magnetic loop structure leads to a stationary magnetic field configuration with zero power and flux outflows.   In addition we discuss recent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which establish that quasi-stationary collimated Poynting jets similar to our Grad-Shafranov solutions arise from the inner part of a disk threaded by a dipole-like magnetic field. At the same time we find that there is a steady uncollimated hydromagnetic outflow from the outer part of the disk. The Poynting jets represent a likely model for the jets from active galactic nuclei, microquasars, and gamma ray burst sources."

Initial equations depend upon four complex parameters $\\lambda_{i}$, obeying two supplementary conditions, so restriction of the model to the case of electrically neutral vector particle is not a trivial task. A special basis in the space of 15-component wave functions is found where instead of four $\\lambda_{i}$ only one real-valued quantity $\\sigma$, a bilinear combination of $\\lambda_{i}$, is presented. This $\\lambda$-parameter is interpreted as an additional electromagnetic characteristic of a charged vector particle, polarizability. It is shown that in this basis $C$-operation is reduced to the complex conjugation only, without any accompanying linear transformation. Restriction to a massless vector particle is determined.   Extension of the whole theory to the case of Riemannian space-time is accomplished. Two methods of obtaining corresponding generally covariant wave equations are elaborated: of tensor- and of tetrad-based ones. Their equivalence is proved. It is shown that in case of pure curved space-time models without Cartan torsion no specific additional interaction terms because of non-flat geometry arise. The conformal symmetry of a massless generally covariant equation is demonstrated explicitly.

Each chemical component in the material under investigation has a characteristic absorption or phase contrast as a function of photon energy. Using a reference dictionary formed by the set of contrast functions of photon energy of the chemical components, it is possible to obtain the chemical composition of the material from high resolution multi-spectral images. Here we investigate the use of a known or an incomplete dictionary (partially known) in spectroscopic blind-phase retrieval ptychography. We establish a nonlinear spectroscopic ptychography model (SP) model based on Poisson maximum likelihood, and develop fast iterative operator-splitting based algorithms.

Tunneling fixed points are a subset of `termination' fixed points, which describe boundary conditions on a multicomponent edge. The requirement of unitary time evolution at the boundary gives a nontrivial consistency condition for possible low-energy boundary conditions. The effect of interactions and random hopping on fixed points is studied through a perturbative RG approach which generalizes the Giamarchi-Schulz RG for disordered Luttinger liquids to broken left-right symmetry and multiple modes. The allowed termination points of a multicomponent edge are classified by a B-matrix with rational matrix elements. We apply our approach to a number of examples, such as tunneling between a quantum Hall edge and a superconductor and tunneling between two quantum Hall edges in the presence of interactions. Interactions are shown to induce a continuous renormalization of effective tunneling charge for the integrable case of tunneling between two Laughlin states. The correlation functions of electronlike operators across a junction are found from the B matrix using a simple image-charge description, along with the induced lattice of boundary operators. Many of the results obtained are also relevant to ordinary Luttinger liquids."

When presented with a document, each classifier estimates the probability for the document to be relevant to the topic for which it has been trained. Since the procedure for building a filter is topic-independent, the system is fully automatic.   By making use of a sample of documents that have previously been evaluated as relevant or not relevant to a particular topic, a term selection is performed, and a neural network is trained. Each document is represented by a vector of frequencies of a list of selected terms. This list depends on the topic to be filtered; it is constructed in two steps. The first step defines the characteristic words used in the relevant documents of the corpus; the second one chooses, among the previous list, the most discriminant ones. The length of the vector is optimized automatically for each topic. At the end of the term selection, a vector of typically 25 words is defined for the topic, so that each document which has to be processed is represented by a vector of term frequencies.   This vector is subsequently input to a classifier that is trained from the same sample. After training, the classifier estimates for each document of a test set its probability of being relevant; for submission to TREC, the top 1000 documents are ranked in order of decreasing relevance."

        "Title": "The sedimentation of flexible filaments",
        "Abstract": "The dynamics of a flexible filament sedimenting in a viscous fluid are explored analytically and numerically. Compared to the well-studied case of sedimenting rigid rods, the introduction of filament compliance is shown to cause a significant alteration in the long-time sedimentation orientation and filament geometry. A model is developed by balancing viscous, elastic, and gravitational forces in a slender-body theory for zero-Reynolds-number flows, and the filament dynamics are characterized by a dimensionless elasto-gravitation number. Filaments of both non-uniform and uniform cross-sectional thickness are considered. In the weakly flexible regime, a multiple-scale asymptotic expansion is used to obtain expressions for filament translations, rotations, and shapes. These are shown to match excellently with full numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that trajectories of sedimenting flexible filaments, unlike their rigid counterparts, are restricted to a cloud whose envelope is determined by the elasto-gravitation number. In the highly flexible regime we show that a filament sedimenting along its long axis is susceptible to a buckling instability. A linear stability analysis provides a dispersion relation, illustrating clearly the competing effects of the compressive stress and the restoring elastic force in the buckling process. The instability travels as a wave along the filament opposite the direction of gravity as it grows and the predicted growth rates are shown to compare favorably with numerical simulations. The linear eigenmodes of the governing equation are also studied, which agree well with the finite-amplitude buckled shapes arising in simulations."

        "Abstract": "We present the kpc-scale behaviour of the powerful extragalactic radio source Hercules A and the behaviour of the intracluster gas in which the radio source is situated. We have found that Hercules A exhibits a strong Laing-Garrington effect. The X-ray observations have revealed an extended X-ray emission elongated along the radio galaxy axis. The estimated temperature of the cluster is kT = 2.45 keV and the central electron density is no~7.8 x 10^(-3) cm^(-3) which reveals a hot, dense environment in which Hercules A is situated. From the combined study of the radio and X-ray data we have estimated a central value of 3<Bo (muG)<9. We also present the most recent results from the analysis of the radio data on the pc-scale structure of the radio galaxy, observed at 18 cm by the EVN-MERLIN array. A faint but compact radio source, coincident with the optical centre of Hercules A was detected by the EVN at 18 mas resolution. The total flux density of the EVN core is 14.6 mJy. Its angular size is 18 x 7 mas with a position angle of ~139 degrees. There is also evidence for extended emission in the NW-SE direction, most probably from the eastern pc-scale jet. If this is true then there is a misalignment between the direction of the pc-eastern and the aligned kpc-scale jets of ~35 degrees."

We confirm the soft excess in both sources, even if for Mrk~841 a warm absorber provides a fit almost as good as the one with a true excess. As far as the hard X-ray continuum is concerned, a Comptonization model provides a fit as good as a power law and a physically sound solution for Mrk841. For Mrk335, the Comptonization model gives a result which is somewhat better on statistical ground, but rather problematic on physical ground. The most interesting results regard the reprocessing components. For Mrk841 we find a very large reflection continuum but an almost normal iron line equivalent width even if, within the errors, a solution in which both components are a factor ~2 larger than expected for an accretion disc is still marginally acceptable. If this is the case, an anisotropy of the primary emission seems the best explanation. On the contrary, in Mrk335 we find a very large iron line EW but a reflection component not accordingly large. In this case, the best solution seems to be in terms of reflection from an ionized disc."

E 62, 6071 (2000)] by means of detailed Monte Carlo simulations in one and two dimensions. Particles of type A may independently hop to an adjacent lattice site provided it is occupied by at least one B particle. The B particle species undergoes diffusion-limited reactions. In an active state with nonzero, essentially homogeneous B particle saturation density, the A species displays normal diffusion. In an inactive, absorbing phase with exponentially decaying B density, the A particles become localized. In situations with algebraic decay rho_B(t) ~ t^{-alpha_B}, as occuring either at a non-equilibrium continuous phase transition separating active and absorbing states, or in a power-law inactive phase, the A particles propagate subdiffusively with mean-square displacement <x(t)^2_A> ~ t^{1-alpha_A}. We find that within the accuracy of our simulation data, \\alpha_A = \\alpha_B as predicted by a simple mean-field approach. This remains true even in the presence of strong spatio-temporal fluctuations of the B density. However, in contrast with the mean-field results, our data yield a distinctly non-Gaussian A particle displacement distribution n_A(x,t) that obeys dynamic scaling and looks remarkably similar for the different processes investigated here. Fluctuations of effective diffusion rates cause a marked enhancement of n_A(x,t) at low displacements |x|, indicating a considerable fraction of practically localized A particles, as well as at large traversed distances."

We also find that the line profile is variable over a timescale of a day or less. The core of the H-alpha line also shows a narrow Zeeman triplet corresponding to a field strength of of about 100kG which appears to be almost constant in shape. These observations suggest that the magnetic field on WD1953-011 has a complex structure and that the star has a rotational period of hours or days which causes the observed variability of the spectra. We argue that neither an offset dipole model nor a double-dipole model are sufficient to explain our observations. Instead, we propose a two component model consisting of a high field region of magnetic field strength of about 500kG covering about 10% of the surface area of the star superimposed on an underlying dipolar field of mean field strength of about 70kG. Radial velocity measurements of the narrow Zeeman triplet show that the radial velocity is constant to within a few km/s so this star is unlikely to be a close binary."

We demonstrate a Bayesian cognitive model for understanding how people interpret visualizations in light of prior beliefs and show how this model provides a guide for improving visualization evaluation. In a first study, we show how applying a Bayesian cognition model to a simple visualization scenario indicates that people's judgments are consistent with a hypothesis that they are doing approximate Bayesian inference. In a second study, we evaluate how sensitive our observations of Bayesian behavior are to different techniques for eliciting people subjective distributions, and to different datasets. We find that people don't behave consistently with Bayesian predictions for large sample size datasets, and this difference cannot be explained by elicitation technique. In a final study, we show how normative Bayesian inference can be used as an evaluation framework for visualizations, including of uncertainty."

A34, 3735 (2001)], which allow a non-perturbative unified description of the atom radiation process, in both cases, of a finite or an arbitrarily large cavity. We perform a study of the energy distribution in a small cavity, with the initial condition that the atom is in the first excited state and we conclude for the quasi-stability of the excited atom. For instance, for a frequency $\\bar{\\omega}$ of the order $\\bar{\\omega}\\sim 4.00\\times 10^{14}/s$ (in the visible red), starting from the initial condition that the atom is in the first excited level, we find that for a cavity with diameter $2R\\sim 1.0\\times 10^{-6}m$, the probability that the atom be at any time still in the first excited level, will be of the order of 97%.

        "Abstract": "The genesis of spheroids is central to our understanding of galaxy formation -- they are relatively simple systems, containing about half the stellar mass of the Universe. A major subset of spheroids, massive elliptical galaxies, are preferentially found in clusters where they exhibit old, coeval stellar populations suggesting that they formed synchronously at early epochs. Here we report SCUBA submillimeter imaging of a region around a z=1.8 X-ray selected QSO. The image reveals a remarkable 400 kiloparsec long chain of galaxies each with an obscured star-formation rate sufficiently high to build a massive spheroid in less than 1 Gyr. The large over-density of these galaxies relative to expectations for a random field implies they probably reside in a structure associated with the QSO. We suggest that this star formation is associated with galaxy mergers or encounters within the filament, such as those predicted by the popular hierarchical model of galaxy formation. Our observations suggest that strong absorption in the X-ray spectra of QSOs at high-redshifts may result from a veil of gas thrown up by a merger or merger-induced activity, rather than an orientation-dependent obscuring torus. It is argued that these systems are the precursors of elliptical galaxies found today in the core regions of all rich galaxy clusters."

Temporally multiplexed systems offer time-bin encoding of quantum information which provides robustness against decoherence in fibers, crucial in long distance communication.

We analyze the entanglement by mapping the atomic excitation onto a photonic qubit and by using time-bin qubits analyzers implemented with another doped crystal using the atomic frequency comb technique. Our results provide a solid-state source of entangled photons with embedded quantum memory. Moreover, the quality of the entanglement is high enough to enable a violation of a Bell inequality by more than two standard deviations."

        "Abstract": "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of green and sustainable projects has been found to be a necessary analysis in order to include all upstream, downstream, and indirect impacts. Because of the complexity of interactions, the differential impacts with respect to a baseline, i.e., a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, are commonly considered to relatively compare various projects. However, as the degree of penetration of a project in the baseline increases, the popular marginal assumption does no longer hold, and the differential impacts may become inconsistent. Although various mythologies have been successfully proposed and used to contain such a side effect, the bottom-up nature, which initiates the assessment from the project itself and ultimately widens the scope, could easily fail to acknowledge critical modifications to the baseline. This is highly relevant in terms of ICT's disruptive and dynamic technologies which push the baseline to become a marginal legacy. In this work, an analytic formalism is presented to provide a means of comparison of such technologies and projects. The core idea behind the proposed methodology is a magnitude-insensitive graph-based distance function to differentially compare a project with a baseline. The applicability of the proposed methodology is then evaluated in a use case of OTT/IPTV online media distribution services."

        "Abstract": "High precision radial velocity observations of the solar-type star 16 Cygni B taken at McDonald Observatory and at Lick Observatory, have each independently discovered periodic radial-velocity variations indicating the presence of a Jovian-mass companion to this star. The orbital fit to the combined data gives a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude of 43.9 m/s, and an eccentricity of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 Msun, this implies a mass for the companion of 1.5 sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital eccentricity cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal manner with a low eccentricity orbit, and has undergone post-formational orbital evolution, either through the same process which formed the ``massive eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD114762, or by gravitational interactions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the object is an extremely low mass brown dwarf, formed through fragmentation of the collapsing protostar. We explore a possible connection between stellar photospheric Li depletion, pre-main sequence stellar rotation, the presence of a massive proto-planetary disk, and the formation of a planetary companion."

As high resolution spectral data of \\emph{Swift}/XRT is available for the early afterglow, we investigate the shape and evolution of the thermal component in this phase using data from the \\emph{Swift}/BAT, the \\emph{Swift}/XRT, and the \\emph{Fermi}/GBM detectors. An independent fit to the BAT and XRT data reveals two correlated blackbodies with monotonically decreasing temperatures. Hence we investigated the combined data with a model consisting of two blackbodies and a power-law (2BBPL), a model suggested for several bright GRBs. We elicit the following interesting features of the 2BBPL model: a) the same model is applicable from the peak of the last pulse in the prompt emission to the afterglow emission, b) the ratio of temperatures and the fluxes of the two black bodies remains constant throughout the observations, c) the black body temperatures and fluxes show a monotonic decrease with time, with the BB fluxes dropping about a factor of two faster than that of the power-law emission, d) attributing the blackbody emission to photospheric emissions, we find that the photospheric radii increase very slowly with time, and the lower temperature blackbody shows a larger emitting radius than that of the higher temperature black body. We find some evidence that the underlying shape of the non-thermal emission is a cut-off power-law rather than a power-law. We sketch a spine-sheath jet model to explain our observations."

Initially, we employ a false vacuum potential system; however ,when cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein cosmological constant at the end of chaotic inflation, the initial di quark scalar field is not consistent with respect to a semi classical consistency conditions we analyze as the potential changes to the chaotic inflationary potential utilized by Guth. We use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero during initial inflationary cosmology, and obtain a sound speed approaching unity as the slope of the scalar field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All this is to aid in a data reconstruction problem of how to account for the initial origins of CMB due to dark matter since effective field theories as presently constructed require a cut off value for applicability of their potential structure. This is often at the cost of, especially in early universe theoretical models, of clearly defined baryogenesis, and of a well defined mechanism of phase transitions."

        "Abstract": "It has been known for some time that warped extra dimensions offer a potential explanation of the large hierarchy that exists between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale. The majority of this work has focused on a five dimensional slice of AdS space. This thesis attempts to address the question, what possible spaces offer phenomenologically viable resolutions to this gauge hierarchy problem. In order for a space to offer a potential resolution to the hierarchy problem two conditions must be met: Firstly one should be able to demonstrate that the space can be stabilised such that a small effective electroweak scale (or large effective Planck scale) can be obtained. Secondly one must demonstrate that the space allows for a Kaluza Klein (KK) scale that is small enough such that one does not reintroduce a hierarchy in the effective theory. Here we focus on the second condition and examine the constraints, on the KK scale, coming from corrections to electroweak observables and flavour physics which arise when gauge fields propagate in an additional dimension. We study a large class of possible spaces of different geometries and dimensionalities. In five dimensions it is found that such constraints are generically large. In more than five dimensions it is found that a significant proportion of such spaces suffer from either a high density of KK modes or alternatively strongly coupled KK fields. The latter would not offer viable resolutions to the hierarchy problem. Models in which the Higgs propagates in the bulk are also studied, in the context of models with a `soft wall' and it is found these have significantly reduced constraints from flavour physics as well as a notion of a minimum fermion mass."

Rigidity results are given for any reasonable future completion of a spacetime, in terms of the GKP boundary: In the imputed topology, any such boundary must be homeomorphic to the GKP boundary (if all points have indecomposable pasts) or to a topological quotient of a closely related boundary (if boundaries are spacelike). A large class of warped-product-type spacetimes with spacelike boundaries is examined, calculating the GKP and other possible boundaries, and showing that the imputed topology gives expected results; included among these are the Schwarzschild singularity and those Robertson-Walker singularities which are spacelike."

At the TeV scale there are additional scalars, gauge bosons, and vector-like charge 2/3 quarks, whose couplings to the Higgs greatly reduce the UV sensitivity of the Higgs potential. Stabilization of the Higgs mass squared parameter, without finetuning, occurs due to a softly broken shift symmetry--the Higgs is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. Above the 10 TeV scale the theory has new strongly coupled interactions. A perturbatively renormalizable UV completion, with softly broken supersymmetry at 10 TeV is explicitly worked out. Our theory contains new particles which are odd under an exact \"dark matter parity\", (-1)^{(2S+3B+L)}. We argue that such a parity is likely to be a feature of many theories of new TeV scale physics. The lightest parity odd particle, or \"LPOP\", is most likely a neutral fermion, and may make a good dark matter candidate, with similar experimental signatures to the neutralino of the MSSM.

The concept is based on a combined high-current lens/target configuration. Current is fed at an electrode located downstream from the beginning of the target where pion capturing is needed. The current is carried by plasma outside the target. A second plasma lens section, with an additional current feed, follows the target. The plasma is immersed in a relatively small solenoidal magnetic field to facilitate its current profile shaping to optimize pion capture. Simulations of the not yet fully optimized configuration yielded a 25% higher neutrino flux at a detector situated at 3 km from the target than the horn system for the entire energy spectrum and a factor of 2.5 higher flux for neutrinos with energy larger than 3 GeV. A major advantage of plasma lenses is in background reduction. In antineutrino operation, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of close to 3 for the whole spectrum, and for energy larger than 3 GeV, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of 3.6. Plasma lenses have additional advantages: larger axial currents, high signal purity: minimal neutrino background in antineutrino runs. The lens medium consists of plasma, consequently, particle absorption and scattering is negligible. Withstanding high mechanical and thermal stresses in a plasma is not an issue."

In this context classical thermodynamics appears as a particular theory suited to a subset of all dynamical systems. A statistical mechanics similar to the one derived with the microcanonical ensemble emerges from dynamical systems provided it contains, 1) a finite non-integrable part of its phase space which is, 2) ergodic at a satisfactory degree after a finite time. The integrable part of phase space provides the constraints that shape the particular system macroscopical properties, and the chaotic part provides well behaved statistical properties over a relevant finite time. More generic semi-ergodic systems lead to intermittent behaviour, thus may be unsuited for a statistical description of steady states. Following these lines of thought, in a second part non-extensive hierarchical systems with statistical scale-invariance and power law interactions are explored. Only the virial constraint, consistent with their microdynamics, is included. No assumptions of classical thermodynamics are used, in particular extensivity and local homogeneity. In the limit of a large hierarchical range new constraints emerge in some conditions that depend on the interaction law range. In particular for the gravitational case, a velocity-site scaling relation is derived which is consistant with the ones empirically observed in the fractal interstellar medium."

We first tested it on noisy synthetic spectra of A, F, G, and K-type stars, and inverted simultaneously their atmospheric fundamental parameters: Teff, log g, [M/H] and vsini. Different learning databases were calculated using a range of sampling in Teff, log g, vsini, and [M/H]. Combined with a principal component analysis (PCA) nearest neighbors (NN) search, the size of the learning database is reduced. A Tikhonov regularization is applied, given the ill-conditioning of SIR. For all spectral types, decreasing the size of the learning database allowed us to reach internal accuracies better than PCA-based NN-search using larger learning databases. For each analyzed parameter, we have reached internal errors that are smaller than the sampling step of the parameter. We have also applied the technique to a sample of observed FGK and A stars. For a selection of well studied stars, the inverted parameters are in agreement with the ones derived in previous studies. The RSIR inversion technique, complemented with PCA pre-processing proves to be efficient in estimating stellar parameters of A, F, G, and K stars."

In the present paper we establish a category $\\STROP_m$ of supertropical monoids by choosing as morphisms the \"transmissions\", defined in the same way as done in [IKR1] for supertropical semirings. The previously investigated category $STROP$ of supertropical semirings is a full subcategory of $STROP_m.$ Moreover, there is associated to every supertropical monoid $V$ a supertropical semiring $\\hat V$ in a canonical way.   A central problem in [IKR1]-[IKR3] has been to find for a supertropical semiring $U$ the quotient $U/E$ by a \"TE-relation\", which is a certain kind of equivalence relation on the set $U$ compatible with multiplication (cf. [IK1, Definition 4.5]). It turns out that this quotient always exists in $\\STROP_m$. In the good case, that $U/E$ is a supertropical semiring, this is also the right quotient in $\\STROP.$ Otherwise, analyzing $(U/E)^\\wedge,$ we obtain a mild modification of $E$ to a TE-relation $E'$ such that $U/E' = (U/E)^\\wedge$ in $\\STROP.$   In this way we now can solve various problems left open in [IKR1], [IKR2] and gain further insight into the structure of transmissions and supervaluations.

In the case when the host waveguide is linear, the pulse has a Gaussian shape. In that case, an immediate result of its interaction with the nonlinear defect can be found in an exact analytical form, amounting to transformation of the incoming Gaussian into an infinite array of overlapping Gaussian pulses. Further evolution of the array in the linear host medium is found numerically by means of the Fourier transform. An important ingredient of the linear medium is the third-order dispersion, that eventually splits the array into individual pulses. If the host medium is nonlinear, the input pulse is taken as a fundamental soliton. The soliton is found to be much more resistant to the action of the nonlinear defect than the Gaussian pulse in the linear host medium. In this case, the third-order-dispersion splits the soliton proper and wavepackets generated by the action of the defect."

        "Abstract": "The dynamical behavior of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a gas with attractive interactions is striking. Quantum theory predicts that BEC of a spatially homogeneous gas with attractive interactions is precluded by a conventional phase transition into either a liquid or solid. When confined to a trap, however, such a condensate can form provided that its occupation number does not exceed a limiting value. The stability limit is determined by a balance between self-attraction and a repulsion arising from position-momentum uncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near the stability limit, self-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion, causing the condensate to collapse. Growth of the condensate, therefore, is punctuated by intermittent collapses, which are triggered either by macroscopic quantum tunneling or thermal fluctuation. Previous observation of growth and collapse has been hampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms. Here we reduce the stochasticity by controlling the initial number of condensate atoms using a two-photon transition to a diatomic molecular state. This enables us to obtain the first direct observation of the growth of a condensate with attractive interactions and its subsequent collapse."

        "Abstract": "We report on the application of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for studying the Field Emission (FE) properties of a dense array of long and vertically quasi-aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes grown by catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition on a silicon substrate. The use of nanometric probes enables local field emission measurements allowing investigation of effects non detectable with a conventional parallel plate setup, where the emission current is averaged on a large sample area. The micrometric inter-electrode distance let achieve high electric fields with a modest voltage source. Those features allowed us to characterize field emission for macroscopic electric fields up to 250 V/$\\mu$m and attain current densities larger than 10$^5$ A/cm$^2$. FE behaviour is analyzed in the framework of the Fowler-Nordheim theory. A field enhancement factor $\\gamma \\approx$ 40-50 and a turn-on field $E_{turn-on} \\sim$15 V/$\\mu$m at an inter-electrode distance of 1 $\\mu$m are estimated. Current saturation observed at high voltages in the I-V characteristics is explained in terms of a series resistance of the order of M$\\Omega$. Additional effects as electrical conditioning, CNT degradation, response to laser irradiation and time stability are investigated and discussed."

        "Abstract": "Very little attention has been paid to the properties of optical wavefronts and caustic surfaces due to gravitational lensing. Yet the wavefront-based point of view is natural and provides insights into the nature of the caustic surfaces on a gravitationally lensed lightcone. We derive analytically the basic equations governing the wavefronts, lightcones, caustics on wavefronts, and caustic surfaces on lightcones in the context of weak-field, thin-screen gravitational lensing. These equations are all related to the potential of the lens. In the process, we also show that the standard single-plane gravitational lensing map extends to a new mapping, which we call a wavefront lensing map. Unlike the standard lensing map, the Jacobian matrix of a wavefront lensing map is not symmetric. Our formulas are then applied to caustic ``surfing.'' By surfing a caustic surface, a space-borne telescope can be fixed on a gravitationally lensed source to obtain an observation of the source at very high magnification over an extended time period, revealing structure about the source that could not otherwise be resolved. Using our analytical expressions for caustic sheets, we present a scheme for surfing a caustic sheet of a lensed source in rectilinear motion. Detailed illustrations are also presented of the possible types of wavefronts and caustic sheets due to nonsingular and singular elliptical potentials, and singular isothermal spheres, including an example of caustic surfing for a singular elliptical potential lens."

In particular, we attempt to overcharge a system of two extremal black holes via test particle absorption to produce a system involving a black hole and a naked singularity. If such a process is possible, then this would be a potential violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, we find that, analogous to Wald's result for a single charged black hole, such a test particle which can expose the singularity, would not be able to enter the horizon. This provides an interesting and non-trivial example that supports the validity of the cosmic censorship hypothesis in four-dimensional general relativity."

A Peter-Weyl theory for a semicomplete orthonormal set is also possible and is here developed in this paper for compact groups. Existence of semicomplete orthonormal sets on a compact group is proved by an explicit construction of the standard Riemann-Lebesgue semicomplete orthonormal set. This approach gives an insight into the role played by the $L^{2}-$ space of a compact group, which is discovered to be just an example (indeed the largest example for every semicomplete orthonormal set) of what is called a prime-Parseval subspace, which we proved to be dense in the usual $L^{2}-$ space, serves as the natural domain of the Fourier transform and breaks up into a direct-sum decomposition. This paper essentially gives the harmonic analysis of the prime-Parseval subsapce of a compact group corresponding to any semicomplete orthonormal set, with an introduction to what is expected for all connected semisimple Lie groups through the notion of a $K-$semicomplete orthonormal set."

Common goodness of fit methods are based on the calculation of the distribution of certain statistical quantities under the assumption that the model under consideration {\\it holds true}. This proceeding bears methodological flaws, e.g. a good ``fit'' - albeit the model is wrong - might be due to over-fitting, or to the fact that the chosen statistical criterion is not powerful enough against the present particular deviation between model and true regression function. This causes particular difficulties when models with different numbers of parameters are to be compared. Therefore the number of parameters is often penalised additionally. We provide a methodology which circumvents these problems to some extent. It is based on the consideration of the error distribution of the goodness of fit criterion under a broad range of possible models - and not only under the assumption that a given model holds true. We present a graphical method to decide for the most evident model from a range of parametric models of the data. The method allows to quantify statistical evidence {\\it for} the model (up to some distance between model and true regression function) and not only {\\it absence of evidence} against, as common goodness of fit methods do.

        "Abstract": "This thesis is concerned with type-logical grammars and their practical applicability as tools of reasoning about sentence syntax and semantics. The focal point is narrowed to Dutch, a language exhibiting a large degree of word order variability. In order to overcome difficulties arising as a result of that variability, the thesis explores and expands upon a type grammar based on Multiplicative Intuitionistic Linear Logic, agnostic to word order but enriched with decorations that aim to reduce its proof-theoretic complexity. An algorithm for the conversion of dependency-annotated sentences into type sequences is then implemented, populating the type logic with concrete, data-driven lexical types. Two experiments are ran on the resulting grammar instantiation. The first pertains to the learnability of the type-assignment process by a neural architecture. A novel application of a self-attentive sequence transduction model is proposed; contrary to established practices, it constructs types inductively by internalizing the type-formation syntax, thus exhibiting generalizability beyond a pre-specified type vocabulary. The second revolves around a deductive parsing system that can resolve structural ambiguities by consulting both word and type information; preliminary results suggest both excellent computational efficiency and performance."

These aspects have been instrumental in understanding paradigmatic natural phenomena as well as to provide nonclassical applications. A conceptual foundation for the wave nature of a quantum state has recently been presented, through the notion of quantum coherence. We introduce here a parallel notion for the particle nature of a quantum state of an arbitrary physical situation. We provide hints towards a resource theory of particleness, and give a quantification of the same. Finally, we provide evidence for a complementarity between the particleness thus introduced, and the coherence of an arbitrary quantum state."

        "Abstract": "An isolated, spherically-symmetric, self-gravitating, collisionless system is always a polytrope when it reaches equilibrium (Nakamura 2000). This strongly suggests as a corollary, however, that the same polytrope dominates its precursor states, since the dynamical equations for its constituents can be time-reversed. Moreover this assumption, which precludes a polytrope from ever accreting 100% of the mass from an infalling shell, as a subsequent state will eventually be a polytrope, is confirmed now by our finding that a collisionless polytrope cannot accrete 100% of an infalling shell while simultaneously guaranteeing that the entropy of the Universe as a whole increases. These strictures are only evaded by the shedding of some mass. A polytrope must lose mass to gain mass.   We deduce from the time-reversible property of a collisionless polytrope that the scalar sum, P, over constituent momenta in its rest frame is an independent state variable that is conserved with respect to its surface radius through interactions between a polytrope and an infalling shell. This new constraint, together with conservation of energy, enables us (i) to show that an isolated polytrope is indeed stable against spherically-symmetric mass-loss, which is the essential content of our initial assumption; (ii) to calculate both the velocity and the fraction of infall-mass returned to infinity, provided the \"accretion law\" between the change in mass and surface radius is specified. Numerical results confirm a frequent empirical finding (Livio 2000) that the velocity of a mass outflow is of the same order of magnitude as the escape velocity from the system."

        "Abstract": "We have examined the role of the BCS pairing mechanism in the formation of the magnetic moment and henceforth a spin glass (SG) phase by studying a fermionic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a local BCS coupling between the fermions. This model is obtained by using perturbation theory to trace out the conduction electrons degrees of freedom in conventional superconducting alloys. The model is formulated in the path integral formalism where the spin operators are represented by bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields and it reduces to a single site problem that can be solved within the static approximation with a replica symmetric Ansatz. We argue that this is a valid procedure for values of temperature above the de Almeida-Thouless instability line. The phase diagram in the T-g plane, where g is the strength of the pairing interaction, for fixed variance J^2/N of the random couplings J_{ij}, exhibits three regions: a normal paramagnetic (NP) phase, a spin glass (SG) phase and a pairing (PAIR) phase where there is formation of local pairs.The NP and PAIR phases are separated by a second order transition line g=g_{c}(T) that ends at a tricritical point T_{3}=0.9807J, g_{3}=5,8843J, from where it becomes a first order transition line that meets the line of second order transitions at T_{c}=0.9570J that separates the NP and the SG phases. For T<T_{c} the SG phase is separated from the PAIR phase by a line of first order transitions.   These results agree qualitatively with experimental data in Gd_{x}Th_{1-x}RU_{2}."

We present a systematic study on fine-tuning in minimal supersymmetric theories and identify low energy spectra that do not lead to severe fine-tuning. Characteristic features of these spectra are: a large A term for the top squarks, small top squark masses, moderately large tan\\beta, and a small \\mu parameter. There are classes of theories leading to these features, which are discussed. In one class, which allows a complete elimination of fine-tuning, the Higgsinos are the lightest among all the superpartners of the standard model particles, leading to three nearly degenerate neutralino/chargino states. This gives interesting signals at the LHC -- the dilepton invariant mass distribution has a very small endpoint and shows a particular shape determined by the Higgsino nature of the two lightest neutralinos. We demonstrate that these signals are indeed useful in realistic analyses by performing Monte Carlo simulations, including detector simulations and background estimations. We also present a method that allows the determination of all the relevant superparticle masses without using input from particular models, despite the limited kinematical information due to short cascades. This allows us to test various possible models, which is demonstrated in the case of a model with mixed moduli-anomaly mediation. We also give a simple derivation of special renormalization group properties associated with moduli mediated supersymmetry breaking, which are relevant in a model without fine-tuning."

A lower Tc part is then defined within the bridge by irradiating with a much lower dose through a 20 nm wide narrow slit opened in a standard electronic photoresist. These planar junctions, whose settings can be finely tuned, exhibit reproducible and nearly ideal Josephson characteristics. Non hysteretic Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) like behavior is observed, together with sinc Fraunhofer patterns for rectangular junctions. The IcRn product varies with temperature ; it can reach a few mV. The typical resistance ranges from 0.1 to a few ohms, and the critical current density can be as high as 30 kA/cm2. The dispersion in characteristics is very low, in the 5% to 10% range. Such nanojunctions have been used to make microSQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) operating at Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) temperature.

We propose a class of spectral density kernel estimators based on the notion of a flat-top kernel. The new class of estimators employs the inverse Fourier transform of a flat-top function as the weight function employed to smooth the periodogram. It is shown that using a flat-top kernel yields a bias reduction and results in a higher-order accuracy in terms of optimizing the integrated mean square error (IMSE). Notably, the higher-order accuracy of flat-top estimation comes at the sacrifice of the positive semi-definite property. Nevertheless, we show how a flat-top estimator can be modified to become positive semi-definite (even strictly positive definite) in finite samples while retaining its favorable asymptotic properties. In addition, we introduce a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure realized by an automatic inspection of the estimated correlation structure. Our asymptotic results are complemented by a finite-sample simulation where the higher-order accuracy of flat-top estimators is manifested in practice."

The algorithm is initialized using static node embeddings, which are then aligned over the representations of a node at different time points, and eventually adapted for the given task in a joint optimization. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a variety of temporal graphs for the two fundamental tasks of temporal link prediction and multi-label node classification, comparing to competitive baselines and algorithmic alternatives.

As a part of this project, we have performed a pilot study of expert understanding of partial derivatives across three disciplines: physics, engineering and mathematics. Our interviews made use of the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM), which is a mechanical system featuring four observable and controllable properties, of which any two are independent. Using the PDM, we probed expert understanding of partial derivatives in an experimental context in which there is not a known functional form. Through these three interviews, we found that the mathematicians exhibited a striking difference in their understanding of derivatives relative to the other groups. The physicists and engineers were quick to use measurements to find a numeric approximation for a derivative. In contrast, the mathematicians repeatedly returned to speculation as to the functional form, and although they were comfortable drawing qualitative conclusions about the system from measurements, were reluctant to approximate the derivative through measurement. This pilot study led us to further questions. How do fields differ in their experts' concept image of partial derivatives? What representations of partial derivatives are preferred by experts?

        "Abstract": "In this work, we present the results of a wideband measurement campaign at 60 GHz conducted inside a Linkker electric city bus. Targeting prospective millimeter-wave (mmWave) public transportation wearable scenarios, we mimic a typical deployment of mobile high-end consumer devices in a dense environment. Specifically, our intra-vehicle deployment includes one receiver and multiple transmitters corresponding to a mmWave access point and passengers' wearable and hand-held devices. While the receiver is located in the front part of the bus, the transmitters repeat realistic locations of personal devices (i) at the seat level (e.g., a hand-held device) and (ii) at a height 70 cm above the seat (e.g., a wearable device: augmented reality glasses or a head-mounted display). Based on the measured received power, we construct a logarithmic model for the distance-dependent path loss. The parametrized models developed in the course of this study have the potential to become an attractive ground for the link budget estimation and interference footprint studies in crowded public transportation scenarios."

The paper includes investigations of a chiral Ward--Takahashi identity, the explicit chiral symmetry breaking by a finite current quark mass, the modification of the PCAC relationship and its consequences. It is shown that the signals for a hypothetical diquark condensation inside a nucleon and nucleus is observable in high precision experiments despite the fact that they may evade most of the current observations. We briefly discuss how diquark condensation could provide an answer to the question of where about of pions and quark number in a nucleon and a nucleus, which is raised in explaining puzzles in polarized pion nucleus scattering, violation of Gottfried sum rule and EMC effects."

        "Title": "A Variational Approach to Sparse Model Error Estimation in Cardiac  Electrophysiological Imaging",
        "Abstract": "Noninvasive reconstruction of cardiac electrical activity from surface electrocardiograms (ECG) involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem. Cardiac electrophysiological (EP) models have been used as important a priori knowledge to constrain this inverse problem. However, the reconstruction suffer from inaccuracy and uncertainty of the prior model itself which could be mitigated by estimating a priori model error. Unfortunately, due to the need to handle an additional large number of unknowns in a problem that already suffers from ill-posedness, model error estimation remains an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we address this issue by modeling and estimating the a priori model error in a low dimensional space using a novel sparse prior based on the variational approximation of L0 norm. This prior is used in a posterior regularized Bayesian formulation to quantify the error in a priori EP model during the reconstruction of transmural action potential from ECG data. Through synthetic and real-data experiments, we demonstrate the ability of the presented method to timely capture a priori model error and thus to improve reconstruction accuracy compared to approaches without model error correction."

        "Abstract": "On-board processing elements on UAVs are currently inadequate for training and inference of Deep Neural Networks. This is largely due to the energy consumption of memory accesses in such a network. HadaNets introduce a flexible train-from-scratch tensor quantization scheme by pairing a full precision tensor to a binary tensor in the form of a Hadamard product. Unlike wider reduced precision neural network models, we preserve the train-time parameter count, thus out-performing XNOR-Nets without a train-time memory penalty. Such training routines could see great utility in semi-supervised online learning tasks. Our method also offers advantages in model compression, as we reduce the model size of ResNet-18 by 7.43 times with respect to a full precision model without utilizing any other compression techniques. We also demonstrate a 'Hadamard Binary Matrix Multiply' kernel, which delivers a 10-fold increase in performance over full precision matrix multiplication with a similarly optimized kernel."

From these observations, zeta^2 CrB was found to be a triple system and a new spectroscopic orbit was calculated. This orbit has two periods, a 1.72357 day period for the inner binary composed of zeta^2 CrB A & B and a 251 day period for the outer binary composed of zeta^2 CrB AB & C. The inner binary is a double-lined spectroscopic binary composed of two B7 V stars. The inner binary's center of mass (zeta^2 CrB AB) describes a long-period single-lined variation identified with the outer binary. The inner binary period is significantly shorter than the 12.5842 day period previously calculated by Abhyankar & Sarma (1966). The inner binary possesses an essentially circular orbit (e = 0.01) while the outer binary has an eccentric orbit (e = 0.48). From the widths of their Si II 6371 A lines, the vsini's were calculated to be 46 +/- 7 km s^-1 for zeta^2 CrB A and 7.5 +/- 2 km s^-1 for zeta^2 CrB B. As zeta^2 CrB A & B have similar masses, their different rotational velocities make this system a sensitive test of synchronization theories."

        "Abstract": "With high penetrations of renewable generation and variable loads, there is significant uncertainty associated with power flows in DC networks such that stability and constraint satisfaction are important concerns. Most existing DC network optimal power flow (DN-OPF) formulations assume exact knowledge about loading conditions and do not provide stability guarantees. In contrast, this paper studies a DN-OPF formulation which considers both stability and constraint satisfaction under uncertainty. The need to account for a range of uncertainty realizations in this paper's robust optimization formulation results in a challenging semi-infinite program (SIP). The proposed solution algorithm reformulates this SIP into a computationally amenable problem whose solution provides a feasible operating point for the SIP. This algorithm constructs a convex stability set using sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible and stable power flow solution. Solving an optimization problem based on this convex stability set provides generator set points which ensure that the DC network has a stable operating point for any considered uncertainty realization. This optimization problem takes a form similar to a deterministic DN-OPF problem and is therefore tractable. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated using various DC networks adapted from IEEE test cases."

We believe that this model describes a high-mobility semiconductor heterostructure with a random array of antidots. We show that the interplay of scattering by the two types of disorder generates new behavior of $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ which is absent for only one kind of disorder. We demonstrate that even a weak long-range disorder becomes important with increasing $B$. In particular, although $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ vanishes in the limit of large $B$ when only one type of disorder is present, we show that it keeps growing with increasing $B$ in the antidot array in the presence of smooth disorder. The reversal of the behavior of $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ is due to a mutual destruction of the quasiclassical localization induced by a strong magnetic field: specifically, the adiabatic localization in the long-range Gaussian disorder is washed out by the scattering on hard discs, whereas the adiabatic drift and related percolation of cyclotron orbits destroys the localization in the dilute system of hard discs. For intermediate magnetic fields in a dilute antidot array, we show the existence of a strong negative magnetoresistance, which leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of $\\rho_{xx}(B)$."

Then, with the goal of clarifying some confusing results found in the literature concerning the use of a third independent approach for extracting the quantization condition based on a similar differential equation, we show that such an approach cannot yield a general and yet consistent result. We point out to the more accurate, and yet impractical, way to use such an approach, a way which does in principle yield a consistent quantization condition.

The solutions are analyzed on two-dimensional phase space in the variables $(x, \\dot{x})$ where $x$ is a function of a scale factor $a$. Then we show how the horizon problem may be solved on some evolutional paths. It is shown that the models with negative curvature overcome the horizon and flatness problems. The presented method of reduction can be adopted to the analysis of dynamics of the universe with the general form of the equation of state $p=\\gamma(a)\\epsilon$. This is demonstrated using as an example the dynamics of VSL models filled with a non-interacting fluid. We demonstrate a new type of evolution near the initial singularity caused by a varying speed of light. The singularity-free oscillating universes are also admitted for positive cosmological constant. We consider a quantum VSL FRW closed model with radiation and show that the highest tunnelling rate occurs for a constant velocity of light if $c(a) \\propto a^n$ and $-1 < n \\le 0$.

We consider a renewable energy generation process that fully charges the RB at random time instants, and its realization is assumed to be known also by the UP. We reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solve it by dynamic programming (DP) to design battery charging and discharging policies that minimize a linear combination of the privacy leakage and energy cost. We also propose a lower bound and two alternative low-complexity energy management policies, one of which is shown numerically to perform close to the MDP solution."

This duality also yields a formula for the fixation probability of the beneficial type. Haldane's formula states that for a single selectively advantageous individual in a population of size $N$ the probability of fixation is asymptotically equal to the selective advantage $s_N$ divided by half of the offspring variance. For a class of offspring distributions within Kingman attraction we prove this asymptotics for sequences $s_N$ with $N^{-1} \\ll s_N \\ll N^{-2/3} $. It turns out that in this regime of \"moderately weak selection\" the Cannings ancestral selection graph is so close to the ancestral selection graph of a Moran model that a suitable coupling argument allows to play the problem back to the fixation probability in the Moran model, which can be computed explicitly."

Our starting point is a reservoir of moderately cold ($\\approx 300 \\mu$K) metastable $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms prepared by means of a magneto-optic trap (triplet-MOT). A focused 532 nm laser beam produces a strongly elongated optical potential for $^{1}$S$_{0}$-atoms with up to 350 $\\mu$K well depth. A weak focused laser beam at 430 nm, carefully superimposed upon the ODT beam, selectively pumps the $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms inside the capture volume to the singlet state, where they are confined by the ODT. The triplet-MOT perpetually refills the capture volume with $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms thus providing a continuous stream of cold atoms into the ODT at a rate of $10^7 $s$^{-1}$. Limited by evaporation loss, in 200 ms we typically load $5 \\times 10^5$ atoms with an initial radial temperature of 85 $\\mu$K. After terminating the loading we observe evaporation during 50 ms leaving us with $10^5$ atoms at radial temperatures close to 40 $\\mu$K and a peak phase space density of $6.8 \\times 10^{-5}$.

        "Abstract": "The plasma lens concept is examined as an alternative to focusing horns and solenoids for a neutrino beam facility. The concept is based on a combined high-current lens/target configuration. Current is fed at an electrode located downstream from the beginning of the target where pion capturing is needed. The current is carried by plasma outside the target. A second plasma lens section, with an additional current feed, follows the target. The plasma is immersed in a relatively small solenoidal magnetic field to facilitate its current profile shaping to optimize pion capture. Simulations of the not yet fully optimized configuration yielded a 25% higher neutrino flux at a detector situated at 3 km from the target than the horn system for the entire energy spectrum and a factor of 2.5 higher flux for neutrinos with energy larger than 3 GeV. A major advantage of plasma lenses is in background reduction. In antineutrino operation, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of close to 3 for the whole spectrum, and for energy larger than 3 GeV, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of 3.6. Plasma lenses have additional advantages: larger axial currents, high signal purity: minimal neutrino background in antineutrino runs. The lens medium consists of plasma, consequently, particle absorption and scattering is negligible. Withstanding high mechanical and thermal stresses in a plasma is not an issue."

It is shown that most capture orbits behave chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the values of $\\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron separation at capture.   If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly bound, highly eccentric phase.   If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.   We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \\& Paczy\\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\\odot$.

Since the model is a piecewise linear one with an on-site reaction function involving a Heaviside step function, a straightforward linearisation around the front solution presents problems, and we follow an alternative approach in estimating a `stability multiplier' by looking at the variational problem as a succession of linear evolution of the perturbations, punctuated with `kicks' of small but finite duration. The perturbations get damped during the linear evolution, while the kicks amplify only the perturbations located at specific sites (the `significant perturbations', see below) with reference to the propagating front. Comparison is made with results of numerical integration of the reaction-diffusion system whereby it appears likely that the travelling front is temporally stable for all parameter values characterising the model for which it exists. We modify the system by introducing a slow variation of a relevant recovery parameter and perform a leading order singular perturbation analysis to construct a pulse solution in the resulting model. In addition, we obtain (in the leading order) a 1-parameter family of periodic pulse trains for the system, modelling re-entrant pulses in a one-dimensional ring of excitable cells."

We propose a provisioning rule for the capacity levels and show that these lead to near-optimal resource utilization, while guaranteeing good quality-of-service levels for Electric Vehicle (EV) users.

We prove that if C was hereditary, then the assignments V-> X_{V,ii} define algebra homomorphisms from the (dual) Hall-Ringel algebra of C to the P_{C,ii}, which generalize the well-known Feigin homomorphisms from the upper half of a quantum group to q-polynomial algebras.   If C is the representation category of an acyclic valued quiver (Q,d) and ii=(ii_0,ii_0), where ii_0 is a repetition-free source-adapted sequence, then we prove that the ii-character X_{V,ii} equals the quantum cluster character X_V introduced earlier by the second author in [29] and [30]. Using this identification, we deduce a quantum cluster structure on the quantum unipotent cell corresponding to the square of a Coxeter element. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture from the joint paper [5] of the first author with A. Zelevinsky for such quantum unipotent cells. As a byproduct, we construct the quantum twist and prove that it preserves the triangular basis introduced by A. Zelevinsky and the first author in [6]."

These two well-known effects arise from the interaction between a moving atom or detector with a quantum field under some boundary conditions introduced by a conducting mirror/cavity or dielectric wall. The Casimir-Polder force is a retardation force on the atom due to the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic field in the presence of a conducting mirror or dielectric wall. We have recently provided an improved calculation by treating the mutual influence of the atom and the (constrained) field in a self-consistent way. For an atom moving adiabatically, perpendicular to a mirror, our result finds a coherent retardation correction up to twice the stationary value. Unruh effect refers loosely to the fact that a uniformly accelerated detector feels hot. Two prior schemes have been proposed for the detection of `Unruh radiation', based on charged particles in linear accelerators and storage rings. Here we are interested in a third scheme proposed recently by Scully {\\it et al} \\cite{Scully03} involving the injection of accelerated atoms into a microwave or optical cavity. We analyze two main factors instrumental to the purported success in this scheme, the cavity factor and the sudden switch-on factor.

In order to overcome difficulties arising as a result of that variability, the thesis explores and expands upon a type grammar based on Multiplicative Intuitionistic Linear Logic, agnostic to word order but enriched with decorations that aim to reduce its proof-theoretic complexity. An algorithm for the conversion of dependency-annotated sentences into type sequences is then implemented, populating the type logic with concrete, data-driven lexical types. Two experiments are ran on the resulting grammar instantiation. The first pertains to the learnability of the type-assignment process by a neural architecture. A novel application of a self-attentive sequence transduction model is proposed; contrary to established practices, it constructs types inductively by internalizing the type-formation syntax, thus exhibiting generalizability beyond a pre-specified type vocabulary. The second revolves around a deductive parsing system that can resolve structural ambiguities by consulting both word and type information; preliminary results suggest both excellent computational efficiency and performance."

To study the appearance of nonzero masses this theory is explicitly broken by a term in the Lagrangean involving the curvature scalar R of the W_4 and a mass term for the scalar field. Thereby also the gauge fields as well as the charged fermion field acquire a mass as in the standard electroweak theory. The symmetry breaking is governed by the relation D Phi^2=0, where Phi is the modulus of the scalar field and D denotes the Weyl-covariant derivative. This true symmetry reduction, establishing a scale of length in the theory, is compared to the so-called spontanous symmetry breaking in the standard electroweak theory which is, actually, the choice of a particular (nonlinear) gauge obtained by adopting an origin in the coset space representing the scalar field which is invariant under the electromagnetic gauge group. Particular attention is devoted to the appearance of Einstein's equations for the metric after the Weyl-symmetry breaking yielding a pseudo-Riemannian space V_4 from a W_4 and a scalar field with a constant modulus which in turn affects Einstein's gravitational constant in a manner comparable to the Brans-Dicke theory."

We show how to compute tasks in a noise-resilient manner over noisy beeping networks of arbitrary structure. In particular, we transform any algorithm that assumes a noiseless beeping network (of size $n$) into a noise-resilient version while incurring a multiplicative overhead of only $O(\\log n)$ in its round complexity, with high probability. We show that our coding is optimal for some tasks, such as node-coloring of a clique.

The simulation succeeds with high probability and incurs an asymptotic multiplicative overhead of $O(B\\cdot \\Delta \\cdot \\min(n,\\Delta^2))$ in the round complexity, where $\\Delta$ is the maximal degree of the network.

We introduce a new figure of merit, the variation of information statistic (VI; Meila 2003), used to optimise the free parameter(s) of the MCL algorithm. We explain that the common Friends-of-Friends (FoF) method is a subset of MCL. We test MCL in real space on a realistic mock galaxy catalogue constructed from a N-body simulation using the GALFORM model. With a fixed linking length FoF produces the best group catalogues as quantified by the VI statistic. By making the linking length sensitive to the local galaxy density, the quality of the FoF and MCL group catalogues improve significantly, with MCL being preferred over FoF due to a smaller VI value. The MCL group catalogue recovers accurately the underlying halo multiplicity function at all multiplicities. MCL provides better and more consistent group purity and halo completeness values at all multiplicities than FoF. As MCL allows for probabilistic pairwise connections, it is a promising algorithm to find galaxy groups in photometric surveys."

In this article, we take some modest steps in suggesting alternative treatments of such cases via non-critical (Liouville) strings,which do not have a well-defined S matrix, but for which a superscattering \\$ matrix is mathematically consistent. After a brief review of the underlying mathematical formalism, we consider a specific stringy model of induced non-criticality, with dynamical formation of horizons, associated with the recoil of a D-particle defect, embedded in our four-dimensional space time, during its scattering with a (macroscopic) number of closed string states. We study in detail the associated spacetime distortion in the neighbourhood of the defect, which has the form of a finite-radius curved `bubble', matched with a Minkowskian space-time in the exterior. As a consequence of the non-criticality of the underlying sigma-model, the space time is unstable, and has non-trivial stochastic properties: thermal properties due to its ``Rindler accelerating nature'', and entropy growth for an asymptotic observer, associated with information being carried away by the `recoil' degrees of freedom. We also discuss phenomenological (and cosmological) constraints on the model."

        "Abstract": "Poly-vinlyacetate (PVAc) forms very stable and reproducible monolayers on the surface of water, a model system to understand polymer physics on two dimensions. A recently introduced technique is applied here to to study viscoelasticity of PVAc monolayers. The method is based on measurement of surface tension in two orthogonal directions during anisotropic deformation. Compression and shear moduli are explored over a very large concentration range, highlighting a series of four different regimes. At low concentration the polymers are in a dilute gas. Above the overlap concentration $\\Gamma^\\ast$ there is a fluid semi-dilute region, where the monolayer properties are described by scaling laws. At a threshold concentration $\\Gamma^{\\ast\\ast}$, a decrease in the gradient of pressure with concentration is observed, and we argue that there is still a large fraction of free area on the surface. Compressing further, we then identify close packing as the point where the pressure gradient rises sharply and a shear modulus emerges. This is interpreted as a transition to a soft-solid due to the kinetic arrest of close-packed monomers. The reological properties of PVAc above $\\Gamma^{\\ast\\ast}$ have not been studied previously. Discussion includes possible explanations for the observed behaviour in terms of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, and the relation to microscopic chain properties. Temperature dependent effects around $\\Gamma^{\\ast\\ast}$ are also observed and described."

        "Abstract": "We consider an elliptic eigenvalue problem with a fast cellular flow of amplitude $A$, in a two-dimensional domain with $L^2$ cells. For fixed $A$, and $L \\to \\infty$, the problem homogenizes, and has been well studied. Also well studied is the limit when $L$ is fixed, and $A \\to \\infty$. In this case the solution equilibrates along stream lines.   In this paper, we show that if \\textit{both} $A \\to \\infty$ and $L \\to \\infty$, then a transition between the homogenization and averaging regimes occurs at $A \\approx L^4$. When $A\\gg L^4$, the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue is approximately constant. On the other hand, when $A\\ll L^4$, the principal eigenvalue behaves like ${\\bar \\sigma(A)}/L^2$, where $\\bar \\sigma(A) \\approx \\sqrt{A} I$ is the effective diffusion matrix. A similar transition is observed for the solution of the exit time problem. The proof in the homogenization regime involves bounds on the second correctors. Miraculously, if the slow profile is quadratic, these estimates can be obtained using drift independent $L^p \\to L^\\infty$ estimates for elliptic equations with an incompressible drift. This provides effective sub and super-solutions for our problem."

        "Abstract": "We discuss a recent experiment in which the resistance of a superconducting film has been measured in magnetic field. A strong decrease of the superconducting film resistance has been observed when a metallic gate is placed above the film. We study how the magnetic coupling between vortices in a thin superconducting film and electrons in a remote unbiased gate suppresses the tunneling rate of the vortices. We examine two general approaches to analyze tunneling in the presence of slow low-energy degrees of freedom: the functional-integral and scattering formalisms. In the first one, the response of the electrons inside the metallic gate to a change in the vortex position is described by the \"tunneling with dissipation\". We consider the Eddy current induced in the gate by the magnetic flux of the vortex as a result of tunneling. In the second approach, the response is given in terms of scattering of the electrons by the magnetic flux of the vortex in a way similar to the Aharonov-Bohm scattering. A sudden change in the vortex position leads to the Orthogonality Catastrophe that opposes the vortex tunneling. We show that the magnetic coupling between the vortices and the electrons inside the gate can lead to a dramatic suppression of the vortex tunneling, restoring the superconducting property in accord with the experiment."

We do this for a toy model of two non-relativistic scalars coupled to the same point-particle, on which there is a flavour-violating coupling. It is found that the point-particle couplings all must be renormalized with respect to a radial cut-off near the origin, and it is an invariant of the flow of the flavour-changing coupling that is directly related to particle-changing cross-sections. At the same time, we find an interesting dependence of those cross-sections on the ratio k_out/k_in of the outgoing and incoming momenta, which can lead to a 1/k_in enhancement in certain regimes. We further connect this model to the case of a single-particle non-self-adjoint (absorptive) PPEFT, as well as to a PPEFT of a single particle coupled to a two-state nucleus. These results could be relevant for future calculations of any more complicated reactions, such as nucleus-induced electron-muon conversions, monopole catalysis of baryon number violation, as well as nuclear transfer reactions."

We consider specifically an Ising model in two dimensions, as a prototypical system with a phase transition into stable phases distinguished by a local order parameter, driven by a thermal dynamics and periodically kicked. We show that for a wide parameter range a stable DTC emerges. The phase transition to the DTC state appears to be in the equilibrium 2D Ising class when dynamics is observed stroboscopically. However, we show that the DTC is a genuine non-equilibrium state. More generally, we speculate that systems with thermal phase transitions to multiple competing phases can give rise to DTCs when appropriately driven."

RXTE also resolves the Fe K-alpha fluorescence line with FWHM ~48,000 km s^{-1}. This measurement provides the first independent confirmation of ASCA detections in Seyfert galaxies of broad Fe K-alpha lines that are thought to be the signature of emission from the inner regions of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole. Under the assumption that reflection arises from an isotropic source located above a neutral accretion disk, and using a theoretical model that accounts for the dependence of the reflected spectrum on inclination angle, we derive a 90% confidence range for the disk inclination of i = 50 to 81 degrees. The large inclination is consistent with that expected from the unified model for MCG-5-23-16 based on its Seyfert 1.9 classification. If we assume that the high-energy cutoff in the incident spectrum lies at energies larger than a few hundred keV, then the equivalent width of the Fe K-alpha line is much larger than predicted for the amount of reflection. This implies either an enhanced iron abundance, a covering factor of reflecting material > 0.5, or a cutoff in the incident spectrum at energies between ~60 and ~200 keV."

It has the same phase space as ideal hydrodynamics, a coadjoint orbit of the volume-preserving diffeomorphism group of M, SDiff(M,mu). Gauge field Poisson brackets differ from the Heisenberg algebra, but are reminiscent of Yang-Mills theory on a null surface. Enstrophy invariants are Casimirs of the Poisson algebra of gauge invariant observables. Some symplectic leaves of the Poisson manifold are identified. The Hamiltonian is a magnetic energy, similar to that of electrodynamics, and depends on a metric whose volume element is not a multiple of mu. The magnetic field evolves by a quadratically non-linear `Euler' equation, which may also be regarded as describing geodesic flow on SDiff(M,mu). Static solutions are obtained. For uniform mu, an infinite sequence of local conserved charges beginning with the hamiltonian are found. The charges are shown to be in involution, suggesting integrability. Besides being a theory of a novel kind of ideal flow, this is a toy-model for Yang-Mills theory and matrix field theories, whose gauge-invariant phase space is conjectured to be a coadjoint orbit of the diffeomorphism group of a non-commutative space."

In order to create a personalized talking head model, these works require training on a large dataset of images of a single person. However, in many practical scenarios, such personalized talking head models need to be learned from a few image views of a person, potentially even a single image. Here, we present a system with such few-shot capability. It performs lengthy meta-learning on a large dataset of videos, and after that is able to frame few- and one-shot learning of neural talking head models of previously unseen people as adversarial training problems with high capacity generators and discriminators. Crucially, the system is able to initialize the parameters of both the generator and the discriminator in a person-specific way, so that training can be based on just a few images and done quickly, despite the need to tune tens of millions of parameters. We show that such an approach is able to learn highly realistic and personalized talking head models of new people and even portrait paintings."

Unfortunately, quite often real socio-economic issues do not fulfill restrictive assumptions of procedures of causal analysis proposed in the literature. This paper indicates certain empirical challenges and conceptual opportunities related to applications of procedures of data depth concept into a process of causal inference as to socio-economic phenomena. We show, how to apply a statistical functional depths in order to indicate factual and counterfactual distributions commonly used within procedures of causal inference. Thus a modification of Rubin causality concept is proposed, i.e., a centrality-oriented causality concept. The presented framework is especially useful in a context of conducting causal inference basing on official statistics, i.e., basing on already existing databases. Methodological considerations related to extremal depth, modified band depth, Fraiman-Muniz depth, and multivariate Wilcoxon sum rank statistic are illustrated by means of example related to a study of an impact of EU direct agricultural subsidies on a digital development in Poland in a period of 2012-2019."

        "Abstract": "We theoretically study the polarizability and the interactions of neutral complexes consisting of a semi-flexible polyelectrolyte adsorbed onto an oppositely charged spherical colloid. In the systems we studied, the bending energy of the chain is small compared to the Coulomb energy and the chains are always adsorbed on the colloid. We observe that the polarizability is large for short chains and small electrical fields and shows a non-monotonic behavior with the chain length at fixed charge density. The polarizability has a maximum for a chain length equal to half of the circumference of the colloid. For long chains we recover the polarizability of a classical conducting sphere. For short chains, the existence of a permanent dipole moment of the complexes leads to a van der Waal's-type long-range attraction between them. This attractive interaction vanishes for long chains (i.e., larger than the colloidal size), where the permanent dipole moment is negligible. For short distances the complexes interact with a deep short-ranged attraction which is due to energetic bridging for short chains and entropic bridging for long chains. Exceeding a critical chain length eventually leads to a pure repulsion. This shows that the stabilization of colloidal suspensions by polyelectrolyte adsorption is strongly dependent on the chain size relative to the colloidal size: for long chains the suspensions are always stable (only repulsive forces between the particles), while for mid-sized and short chains there is attraction between the complexes and a salting-out can occur."

        "Abstract": "The classical numerical treatment of boundary value problems defined on infinite intervals is to replace the boundary conditions at infinity by suitable boundary conditions at a finite point, the so-called truncated boundary. A truncated boundary allowing for a satisfactory accuracy of the numerical solution has to be determined by trial and errors and this seems to be the weakest point of the classical approach. On the other hand, the free boundary approach overcomes the need for a priori definition of the truncated boundary. In fact, in a free boundary formulation the unknown free boundary can be identified with a truncated boundary and being unknown it has to be found as part of the solution. In this paper we consider a different way to overcome the introduction of a truncated boundary, namely finite differences schemes defined on quasi-uniform grids. A quasi-uniform grid allows us to describe the infinite domain by a finite number of intervals. The last node of such grid is placed on infinity so right boundary conditions are taken into account exactly. We apply the proposed approach to the Falkner-Skan model and to a problem of interest in foundation engineering. The obtained numerical results are found in good agreement with those available in literature. Moreover, we provide a simple way to improve the accuracy of the numerical results using Richardson's extrapolation. Finally, we indicate a possible way to extend the proposed approach to boundary value problems defined on the whole real line."

A k-divisible element is a (non-commutative) random variable whose n-th moment vanishes whenever n is not a multiple of k. First, we consider the combinatorial convolution \\ast in the lattices NC of non-crossing partitions and NC^k of k-divisible non-crossing partitions and show that convolving k times with the zeta-function in NC is equivalent to convolving once with the zeta-function in NC^k. Furthermore, when x is k-divisible, we derive a formula for the free cumulants of x^k in terms of the free cumulants of x, involving k-divisible non-crossing partitions. Second, we prove that if a and s are free and s is k-divisible then sps and a are free, whenever p is any polynomial (on a and s) of degree k - 2 on s. Moreover, we define a notion of R-diagonal k-tuples and prove similar results. Next, we show that free multiplicative convolution between a measure concentrated in the positive real line and a probability measure with k-symmetry is well defined. Analytic tools to calculate this convolution are developed. Finally, we concentrate on free additive powers of k-symmetric distributions and prove that \\mu t is a well defined probability measure, for all t > 1. We derive central limit theorems and Poisson type ones. More generally, we consider freely infinitely divisible measures and prove that free infinite divisibility is maintained under the mapping \\mu \\rightarrow \\mu^k . We conclude by focusing on (k-symmetric) free stable distributions, for which we prove a reproducing property generalizing the ones known for one sided and real symmetric free stable laws."

        "Abstract": "Results of a systematic theoretical study of collisions between moving solitons in a fiber grating are presented. Various outcomes of the collision are identified, the most interesting one being merger of the solitons into a single zero-velocity pulse, which suggests a way to create pulses of ``standing light\". The merger occurs with the solitons whose energy takes values between 0.15 and 0.35 of the limit value, while their velocity is limited by about 0.2 of the limit light velocity in the fiber. If the energy is larger, another noteworthy outcome is acceleration of the solitons as a result of the collision. In the case of mutual passage of the solitons, inelasticity of the collision is quantified by the energy-loss share. Past the soliton's stability limit, the collision results in strong deformation and subsequent destruction of the solitons. Simulations of multiple collisions of two solitons in a fiber-loop configuration are performed too. In this case, the maximum velocity admitting the merger increases to about 0.4 of the limit velocity. Influence of an attractive local defect on the collision is also studied, with a conclusion that the defect does not alter the overall picture, although it traps a small-amplitude pulse. Related effects in single-soliton dynamics are considered too, such as transformation of an input sech signal into a gap soliton (which is quantified by the share of lost energy), and the rate of decay of a quiescent gap soliton in a finite fiber grating, due to energy leakage through loose edges."

In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator.

The EZ model, which is a dynamical version of the herd formation model of Cont and Bouchaud (CB), gives a reasonable model for the formation of clusters of agents and for actions taken by clusters of agents. Both the EZ and CB models give a cluster size distribution characterized by a power law with an exponent -5/2. By introducing a size-dependent probability for dissociation of a cluster of agents, we show that the exponent characterizing the cluster size distribution becomes model-dependent and non-universal, with an exponential cutoff for large cluster sizes. The actions taken by the clusters of agents generate the price returns, the distribution of which is also characterized by a model-dependent exponent. When a size-dependent transaction rate is introduced instead of a size-dependent dissociation rate, it is found that the distribution of price returns is characterized by a model-dependent exponent while the exponent for the cluster-size distribution remains unchanged. The resulting systems provide simplified models of a financial market and yield power law behaviour with an easily tunable exponent."

        "Abstract": "Deep UBVI photometry for a large field covering the distant globular cluster M75 (NGC 6864) is presented. We confirm a previous suggestion (Catelan et al. 1998a) that M75 possesses a bimodal horizontal branch (HB) bearing striking resemblance to the well-known case of NGC 1851. In addition, we detect a third, smaller grouping of stars on the M75 blue tail, separated from the bulk of the blue HB stars by a gap spanning about 0.5 mag in V. Such a group of stars may correspond to the upper part of a very extended, though thinly populated, blue tail. Thus M75 appears to have a trimodal HB. The presence of the \"Grundahl jump\" is verified using the broadband U filter. We explore the color-magnitude diagram of M75 with the purpose of deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, and find a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.03 +/- 0.17 dex and -1.24 +/- 0.21 dex in the Carretta & Gratton (1997) and Zinn & West (1984) scales, respectively. We discuss earlier suggestions that the cluster has an anomalously low ratio of bright red giants to HB stars. A differential age analysis with respect to NGC 1851 suggests that the two clusters are essentially coeval."

        "Title": "The Giant X-Ray Flare of NGC 5905: Tidal Disruption of a Star, a Brown  Dwarf, or a Planet?",
        "Abstract": "We model the 1990 giant X-ray flare of the quiescent galaxy NGC 5905 as the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. From the observed rapid decline of the luminosity, over a timescale of a few years, we argue that the flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequent accretion via a thin disk. The fallback model allows constraints to be set on the black hole mass and the mass of debris. The latter must be very much less than a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. The observations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outer layers of a low-mass main sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarf or a giant planet. We find that the X-ray emission in the flare must have originated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus of circularized material surrounding the black hole. We suggest that the patch corresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impacts the torus. Interestingly, although the peak luminosity of the flare was highly sub-Eddington, the peak flux from the bright spot was close to the Eddington limit. We speculate on the implications of this result for observations of other flare events."

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to the grasping problem using 2.5D images as the only source of information. In particular, we developed a simulated environment where a robot equipped with a vacuum gripper has the aim of reaching blocks with planar surfaces. These blocks can have different dimensions, shapes, position and orientation. Unity 3D allowed us to simulate a real-world setup, where a depth camera is placed in a fixed position and the stream of images is used by our policy network to learn how to solve the task. We explored different DRL algorithms and problem configurations. The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DRL algorithm applied to grasp tasks guided by visual depth camera inputs. When using the proper policy, the proposed method estimates a robot tool configuration that reaches the object surface with negligible position and orientation errors. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful attempt of using 2.5D images only as of the input of a DRL algorithm, to solve the grasping problem regressing 3D world coordinates."

This leads in particular to a solution of a problems posed by Y. Berkovich. In another direction we discuss some aspects of the influence of a $p$-group $P$ on the structure of a finite group which contains $P$ as a Sylow subgroup, under assumptions like every element of order $p$ ($4$ if $p=2$) in a given term of the lower central series of $P$ lies in the center of $P$."

        "Abstract": "We report a comprehensive study of the complex AC conductivity of thin effectively 2D amorphous superconducting InO_x films at zero applied field. Below a temperature scale T_c0 where the superconducting order parameter amplitude becomes well defined, there is a temperature where both the generalized superfluid stiffness acquires a frequency dependence and the DC mangetoresistance becomes linear in field. We associate this with a transition of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii (KTB) type. At our measurement frequencies the superfluid stiffness at T_KTB is found to be larger than the universal value. Although this may be understood with a vortex dielectric constant of epsilon_v ~ 1.9 within the usual KTB theory, this is a relatively large value and indicates that such a system may be out of the domain of applicability of the low-fugacity (low vortex density) KTB treatment. This opens up the possibility that at least some of the discrepancy from a non-universal magnitude is intrinsic. Our finite frequency measurements allow us access to a number of other phenomena concerning the charge dynamics in superconducting thin films, including an enhanced conductivity near the amplitude fluctuation temperature T_c0 and a finite dissipation at low temperature which appears to be a universal aspect of highly disordered superconducting films."

        "Title": "Internal Diffusion-Limited Aggregation: Parallel Algorithms and  Complexity",
        "Abstract": "The computational complexity of internal diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is examined from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. We show that for two or more dimensions, the problem of predicting the cluster from a given set of paths is complete for the complexity class CC, the subset of P characterized by circuits composed of comparator gates. CC-completeness is believed to imply that, in the worst case, growing a cluster of size n requires polynomial time in n even on a parallel computer.   A parallel relaxation algorithm is presented that uses the fact that clusters are nearly spherical to guess the cluster from a given set of paths, and then corrects defects in the guessed cluster through a non-local annihilation process. The parallel running time of the relaxation algorithm for two-dimensional internal DLA is studied by simulating it on a serial computer. The numerical results are compatible with a running time that is either polylogarithmic in n or a small power of n. Thus the computational resources needed to grow large clusters are significantly less on average than the worst-case analysis would suggest.   For a parallel machine with k processors, we show that random clusters in d dimensions can be generated in O((n/k + log k) n^{2/d}) steps. This is a significant speedup over explicit sequential simulation, which takes O(n^{1+2/d}) time on average.   Finally, we show that in one dimension internal DLA can be predicted in O(log n) parallel time, and so is in the complexity class NC."

We find that Q0056-363 is a powerful X-ray quasar, with a 0.3-12 keV unabsorbed luminosity of about 1.2 x 10^45 erg s-1 with the largest part (~67%) emitted below 2 keV. The spectrum reveals a large featureless soft X-ray excess below 2 keV and a strong broad FeKalpha line at 6.4 keV (in the quasar frame). The FeK alpha line is due to low to moderate ionization states of iron (i.e., < Fe XVII), with an equivalent width of about 250 eV and a velocity width of about 25,000 km s-1. Q0056-363 is presently the most luminous AGN known to exhibit such a broad and intense FeKalpha line profile from near neutral iron. The line can be fitted with a relativistic profile from an accretion disc around either a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) or a Kerr (rotating) black hole. A combination of two thermal Comptonization components and a disc reflection model is favored to explain both the continuum over the energy range 0.3-12 keV and the FeK alpha line. A patchy corona covering a large part of the inner disc surface is needed in order to be compatible with the accretion rate inferred from the spectral energy distribution of Q0056-363, unless the mass of the black hole is much higher than about 5 x 10^8 M_odot."

Building on recent advances in the rheology of such 'granular dispersions', we study a paradigmatic example of such powder incorporation: the conching of chocolate, in which a homogeneous, flowing suspension is prepared from an inhomogeneous mixture of particulates, triglyceride oil and dispersants. Studying the rheology of a simplified formulation, we find that the input of mechanical energy and staged addition of surfactants combine to effect a considerable shift in the jamming volume fraction of the system, thus increasing the maximum flowable solid content. We discuss the possible microscopic origins of this shift, and suggest that chocolate conching exemplifies a ubiquitous class of powder-liquid mixing."

Here we study the interplay between these two strategies, for a diffusing particle in an one-dimensional trapping potential $V(x)$, being randomly reset at a constant rate $r$. Stochastic resetting has been of great interest as it is known to provide an \"optimal rate\" ($r_*$) at which the mean first passage time is a minimum. On the other hand an attractive potential also assists in first capture process. Interestingly, we find that for a sufficiently strong external potential, the advantageous optimal resetting rate vanishes (i.e. $r_*\\to 0$). We derive a condition for this $optimal$ $resetting$ $rate$ $vanishing$ $transition$, which is continuous. We study this problem for various functional forms of $V(x)$, some analytically, and the rest numerically. We find that the optimal rate $r_*$ vanishes with the deviation from critical strength of the potential as a power law with an exponent $\\beta$ which appears to be universal."

To capture human trust, we work with a cognitive notion of trust defined as a subjective evaluation that agent A makes about agent B's ability to complete a task, which in turn may lead to a decision by A to rely on B. We propose a probabilistic rational temporal logic PRTL*, which extends the probabilistic computation tree logic PCTL* with reasoning about mental attitudes (beliefs, goals and intentions), and includes novel operators that can express concepts of social trust such as competence, disposition and dependence. The logic can express, for example, that `agent A will eventually trust agent B with probability at least p that B will behave in a way that ensures the successful completion of a given task'. We study the complexity of the automated verification problem and, while the general problem is undecidable, we identify restrictions on the logic and the system that result in decidable, or even tractable, subproblems."

It is shown that most capture orbits behave chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the values of $\\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron separation at capture.   If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly bound, highly eccentric phase.   If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.   We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \\& Paczy\\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\\odot$.

        "Abstract": "Current proposals focusing on neutral atoms for quantum computing are mostly based on using single atoms as quantum bits (qubits), while using cavity induced coupling or dipole-dipole interaction for two-qubit operations. An alternative approach is to use atomic ensembles as qubits. However, when an atomic ensemble is excited, by a laser beam matched to a two-level transition (or a Raman transition) for example, it leads to a cascade of many states as more and more photons are absorbed^1. In order to make use of an ensemble as a qubit, it is necessary to disrupt this cascade, and restrict the excitation to the absorption (and emission) of a single photon only. Here, we show how this can be achieved by using a new type of blockade mechanism, based on the light-shift imbalance (LSI) in a Raman transition. We describe first a simple example illustrating the concept of light shift imbalanced induced blockade (LSIIB) using a multi-level structure in a single atom, and show verifications of the analytic prediction using numerical simulations. We then extend this model to show how a blockade can be realized by using LSI in the excitation of an ensemble. Specifically, we show how the LSIIB process enables one to treat the ensemble as a two level atom that undergoes fully deterministic Rabi oscillations between two collective quantum states, while suppressing excitations of higher order collective states."

VPython framework is used in this paper to perform stochastic simulations of the nano wire formation. The algorithms used for the simulations are presented.

We base our studies on the UV-to-optical spectra (observed and synthetic) of early-type galaxies. A probabilistic latent variable architecture is formulated, and a rigorous Bayesian methodology is employed for solving the inverse modelling problem from the available data. A powerful aspect of our formalism is that it allows us to recover a limited fraction of missing data due to incomplete spectral coverage, as well as to handle observational errors in a principled way. We apply this method to a sample of 21 well-studied early-type spectra, with known star-formation histories. We find that our data-driven Bayesian modelling allows us to identify those early-types which contain a significant stellar population <~ 1 Gyr old. This method would therefore be a very useful tool for automatically discovering various interesting sub-classes of galaxies. (abridged)"

The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

We demonstrate that for annealing schedules involving two consecutive diabatic transitions, an interference effect is generated akin to a double-slit experiment. The observation of oscillations in the ground state probability as a function of $t_f$ (before the adiabatic limit sets in) then constitutes a sensitive test of coherence between energy eigenstates. This is further illustrated by analyzing the effect of coupling the TLS to a thermal bath: increasing either the bath temperature or the coupling strength results in a damping of these oscillations. The theoretical tools we introduce significantly simplify the analysis of the generalized Landau-Zener problem. Furthermore, our analysis connects quantum annealing algorithms exhibiting speedups via the mechanism of coherent diabatic transitions to near-term experiments with quantum annealing hardware."

We calculate a flux-weighted mean red-shift of ~100 km/s and a flux-weighted mean velocity width of 800 km/s (FWHM) for lines from these elements. We also detect a number of transitions from Fe XVIII-XXIV and Ni XIX-XX in absorption; however, the identification of these lines is less certain and a greater range of shifts and breadth is measured. Our observation occurred at a binary phase of phi = 0.76; the lines observed are consistent with absorption in an ionized region of the supergiant O9.7 Iab companion wind. The spectrum is extremely complicated in that a range of temperatures and densities are implied. Prior Chandra HETGS spectra of Cygnus X-1 were obtained in a similar transition state (at phi = 0.93) and in the low/hard state (at phi= 0.84).

For initialization, it is assumed that an accurate knowledge of the subspace in which $L_0$ lies is available. In recent works, Qiu et al proposed and analyzed a novel solution to this problem called recursive projected compressed sensing or ReProCS. In this work, we relax one limiting assumption of Qiu et al's result. Their work required that the $L_t$'s be mutually independent over time. However this is not a practical assumption, e.g., in the video application, $L_t$ is the background image sequence and one would expect it to be correlated over time. In this work we relax this and allow the $L_t$'s to follow an autoregressive model. We are able to show that under mild assumptions and under a denseness assumption on the unestimated part of the changed subspace, with high probability (w.h.p.), ReProCS can exactly recover the support set of $S_t$ at all times; the reconstruction errors of both $S_t$ and $L_t$ are upper bounded by a time invariant and small value; and the subspace recovery error decays to a small value within a finite delay of a subspace change time. Because the last assumption depends on an algorithm estimate, this result cannot be interpreted as a correctness result but only a useful step towards it."

Bulk Comptonization of disc photons is shown to yield a spectral component contributing in the far UV band, and would then be currently unobservable. On the contrary, the bulk Comptonization of broad line photons may yield a significant feature in the soft X-ray band. Such a feature is time-dependent and transient, and dominates over the non thermal continuum only when: a) the dissipation occurs close to, but within, the broad line region; b) other competing processes, like the synchrotron self-Compton emission, yield a negligible flux in the X-ray band. The presence of a bulk Compton component may account for the X-ray properties of high redshift blazars that show a flattening (and possibly a hump) in the soft X-rays, previously interpreted as due to intrinsic absorption. We discuss why the conditions leading to a detectable bulk Compton feature might be met only occasionally in high redshift blazars, concluding that the absence of such a feature in the spectra of most blazars should not be taken as evidence against matter--dominated relativistic jets. The detection of such a component carries key information on the bulk Lorentz factor and kinetic energy associated to (cold) leptons."

In the case of magnetic external forces acting on an ultrarelativistic beam, the longitudinal self-interactions are responsible for CSR (Coherent Synchrotron Radiation)-related phenomena, which have been studied extensively. On the other hand, transverse self-interactions are present too. At the time being, existing theoretical analysis of transverse self-forces deal with the case of a bunch moving along a circular orbit only, without considering the situation of a bending magnet with a finite length. In this paper we propose an electrodynamical analysis of transverse self-fields which originate, at the position of a test particle, from an ultrarelativistic electron bunch moving in an arc of a circle. The problem will be first addressed within a two-particle system. We then extend our consideration to a line bunch with a stepped density distribution, a situation which can be easily generalized to the case of an arbitrary density distribution. Our approach turns out to be also useful in order to get a better insight in the physics involved in the case of simple circular motion and in order to address the well known issue of the partial compensation of transverse self-force."

Our main goal is to show the equalities $\\TC{B} = \\catBb{\\double{B}}+1$ and $\\TCM{B} = \\catBB{\\double{B}}+1$, where $\\double{B}=B{\\times}B$ is a fibrewise pointed space over $B$ whose projection and section are given by $p_{\\double{B}}=\\proj_{2} : B{\\times}B \\to B$ the canonical projection to the second factor and $s_{\\double{B}}=\\Delta_{B} : B \\to B{\\times}B the diagonal. In addition, our method in studying fibrewise L-S category is able to treat a fibrewise space with singular fibres.   Recently, we found a problem with the proof of Theorem 1.13 which states that for a fibrewise well-pointed space $X$ over $B$, we have $\\catBB{X}$ = \\catBb{X}$ and that for a locally finite simplicial complex $B$, we have $\\TC{B} = \\TCM{B}$. While we still conjecture that Theorem 1.13 is true, this problem means that, at present, no proof is given to exist. Alternatively, we show the difference between two invariants $\\catBb{X}$ and $\\catBB{X}$ is at most 1 and the conjecture is true for some cases. We give further corrections mainly in the proof of Theorem 1.12."

        "Title": "Supersymmetry, Naturalness, and Signatures at the LHC",
        "Abstract": "Weak scale supersymmetry is often said to be fine-tuned, especially if the matter content is minimal. This is not true if there is a large A term for the top squarks. We present a systematic study on fine-tuning in minimal supersymmetric theories and identify low energy spectra that do not lead to severe fine-tuning. Characteristic features of these spectra are: a large A term for the top squarks, small top squark masses, moderately large tan\\beta, and a small \\mu parameter. There are classes of theories leading to these features, which are discussed. In one class, which allows a complete elimination of fine-tuning, the Higgsinos are the lightest among all the superpartners of the standard model particles, leading to three nearly degenerate neutralino/chargino states. This gives interesting signals at the LHC -- the dilepton invariant mass distribution has a very small endpoint and shows a particular shape determined by the Higgsino nature of the two lightest neutralinos. We demonstrate that these signals are indeed useful in realistic analyses by performing Monte Carlo simulations, including detector simulations and background estimations. We also present a method that allows the determination of all the relevant superparticle masses without using input from particular models, despite the limited kinematical information due to short cascades. This allows us to test various possible models, which is demonstrated in the case of a model with mixed moduli-anomaly mediation. We also give a simple derivation of special renormalization group properties associated with moduli mediated supersymmetry breaking, which are relevant in a model without fine-tuning."

        "Abstract": "We introduce noisy beeping networks, where nodes have limited communication capabilities, namely, they can only emit energy or sense the channel for energy. Furthermore, imperfections may cause devices to malfunction with some fixed probability when sensing the channel, which amounts to deducing a noisy received transmission. Such noisy networks have implications for ultra-lightweight sensor networks and biological systems.   We show how to compute tasks in a noise-resilient manner over noisy beeping networks of arbitrary structure. In particular, we transform any algorithm that assumes a noiseless beeping network (of size $n$) into a noise-resilient version while incurring a multiplicative overhead of only $O(\\log n)$ in its round complexity, with high probability. We show that our coding is optimal for some tasks, such as node-coloring of a clique.   We further show how to simulate a large family of algorithms designed for distributed networks in the CONGEST($B$) model over a noisy beeping network. The simulation succeeds with high probability and incurs an asymptotic multiplicative overhead of $O(B\\cdot \\Delta \\cdot \\min(n,\\Delta^2))$ in the round complexity, where $\\Delta$ is the maximal degree of the network. The overhead is tight for certain graphs, e.g., a clique. Further, this simulation implies a constant overhead coding for constant-degree networks."

In spite of a great quantity of dynamical information, according to which it will have a close approach with the Earth in the next century, the physical properties of this asteroid are largely unknown. We performed visible and near--infrared photometry and spectroscopy, as well as polarimetric observations. Polarimetric and spectroscopic data allowed us to classify 2004 VD17 as an E-type asteroid. A good agreement was also found with the spectrum of the aubrite meteorite Mayo Belwa. On the basis of the polarimetric albedo (p_v=0.45) and of photometric data, we estimated a diameter of about 320 m and a rotational period of about 2 hours. The analysis of the results obtained by our complete survey have shown that (144898) 2004 VD17 is a peculiar NEO, since it is close to the breakup limits for fast rotator asteroids, as defined by Pravec and Harris (2000). These results suggest that a more robust structure must be expected, as a fractured monolith or a rubble pile in a \"strength regime\" (Holsapple 2002)."

The proof of unitarity of this representation is non trivial and is a consequence of properties of intertwiners which are studied in depth.

The source transited from an initial Low Hard State (LS), to an Intermediate State (IS), and then back to the LS. The source shows an hysteresis effect similar to what is observed in other sources, favoring a common origin for the state transitions in soft X-ray transients. The first transition occurs at a ~ constant 2-200 keV flux, which probably indicates a change in the relative importance of the emitting media. The second transition is more likely driven by a drop in the mass accretion rate.   In both LS, the spectra are characterized by the presence of a strong power-law tail (Compton corona) with a variable high energy cut-off. During the IS, the spectra show the presence of a ~0.8 keV thermal component (accretion disk). We discuss the apparently independent evolution of the two media, and show that right after the X-ray maximum on MJD 51662, the decrease of the source luminosity is due to a decrease of the power-law luminosity, at a constant disk luminosity. This, together with the detection of radio emission (with a spectrum typical of optically thin synchrotron emission), may suggest that the corona is ejected and further detected as a discrete radio ejection."

We interpret the non-equilibrium dynamics in terms of the underlying equilibrium phase transitions consisting of a BKT-transition between a columnar ordered valence bond solid (VBS) and a valence bond liquid (VBL), as well as a first order transition between a staggered VBS and the VBL. We find that quenches from a columnar VBS are ergodic and both order parameters and spatial correlations quickly relax to their thermal equilibrium. By contrast, the staggered side of the first order transition does not display thermalization on numerically accessible timescales. Based on the model's kinematic constraints, we uncover a mechanism of relaxation that rests on emergent, highly detuned multi-defect processes in a staggered background, which gives rise to slow, glassy dynamics at low temperatures even in the thermodynamic limit."

When presented with a document, each classifier estimates the probability for the document to be relevant to the topic for which it has been trained. Since the procedure for building a filter is topic-independent, the system is fully automatic.   By making use of a sample of documents that have previously been evaluated as relevant or not relevant to a particular topic, a term selection is performed, and a neural network is trained. Each document is represented by a vector of frequencies of a list of selected terms. This list depends on the topic to be filtered; it is constructed in two steps. The first step defines the characteristic words used in the relevant documents of the corpus; the second one chooses, among the previous list, the most discriminant ones. The length of the vector is optimized automatically for each topic. At the end of the term selection, a vector of typically 25 words is defined for the topic, so that each document which has to be processed is represented by a vector of term frequencies.   This vector is subsequently input to a classifier that is trained from the same sample. After training, the classifier estimates for each document of a test set its probability of being relevant; for submission to TREC, the top 1000 documents are ranked in order of decreasing relevance."

The empirical description adopted for the direct continuum is the commonly used power law with an exponential cut-off. The most direct test of the theoretical predictions, namely that the equivalent width of the line, Walpha, and the strength R of the reflection relative to the direct continuum are closely related to each other, gives a substantially positive result, that is their mean ratio is very close to expectation, and only a modest spread in the iron abundance seems implied. The existence of a steep correlation between R and the slope Gamma of the power law is not confirmed. A weak evidence is found that the existence of a very shallow trend to increase on average with Gamma cannot be altogether excluded in both R and Walpha, but needs to be tested with a larger sample. The energy Ef in the exponential cut-off spans a range from about 80 to more than 300 keV. A possible correlation is found, with Ef increasing on average with Gamma: if ignored, for instance by keeping Ef at a fixed value in a sample study, it could be cause of artificial steepening in a correlation between R and Gamma."

On the TEXTOR tokamak (Julich, Germany), we run a diagnostic to determine Zeff from the bremsstrahlung emissivity E. From radial profiles of E, electron density ne and temperature Te, profiles for Zeff can be reconstructed. However, their interpretation is difficult outside the plasma centre, because of various uncertainties in E, ne and Te at the edge, which render the radial matching of the different profiles problematic. Conversely, if it were possible to obtain a set of line-integrated values for Zeff directly from the line-integrated measurements of E, ne and Te, then these problems would be avoided. Now, recent advances in the field of statistical signal processing allow the extraction of an unknown signal from a signal mixture. In particular, we describe a procedure for the single-channel Bayesian source separation of a line-integrated Zeff signal from a line-integrated emissivity source, using as a forward model a linearized version of the known functional dependence of Zeff on E, ne and Te. Here, a line-integral over a traditionally obtained Zeff profile may serve as a prior for the line-integrated Zeff signal. In this way, precise information on the electron density and temperature may even become superfluous for the determination of Zeff."

We begin by investigating the properties of the aggressive driving model (ADM), a simple cellular automata-based model of vehicular traffic, a unique feature of which is that it allows a natural extension to capture the essential features of dynein motor traffic. We first calculate several collective properties of the ADM, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, analytically using two different mean-field approaches as well as by carrying out computer simulations. Then we extend the ADM by incorporating the possibilities of attachment and detachment of motors on the track which is a common feature of a large class of motor proteins that are collectively referred to as cytoskeletal motors. The interplay of the boundary and bulk dynamics of attachment and detachment of the motors to the track gives rise a phase where high and low density phases separated by a stable domain wall coexist. We also compare and contrast our results with the model of Parmeggiani et. al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 90}, 086601 (2003)) which can be regarded as a minimal model for traffic of a closely related family of motor proteins called kinesin. Finally, we compare the transportation efficiencies of dynein and kinesin motors over a range of values of the model parameters."

        "Abstract": "A comprehensive theoretical description is given for the spin relaxation and diffusion in solids. The formulation is made in a general statistical-mechanical way. The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

The image of the positive part of the unit ball under Psi is called the spectral scale of {b_1, .., b_n} relative to tau and is denoted by B. In a previous paper with Nik Weaver we showed that the geometry of B reflects spectral data for real linear combinations of the operators {b_1, .., b_n}. For example, we showed that an exposed face in B is determined by a certain pair of spectral projections of a real linear combination of {b_1, .., b_n}. In the present paper we extend this study to faces that are not exposed. We completely describe the structure of arbitrary faces of B in terms of {b_1, .., b_n} and tau. We also study faces of convex, compact sets that are exposed by more than one hyperplane of support. Although many of the conclusions of this study involve too much notation to fit nicely in an abstract, there are two results that give their flavor very well. Let N be the algebra generated by {b_1, ..., b_n} and the identity. Theorem 6.1: If the set of extreme points of B is countable, then N is abelian.

Motivated by that, we propose a construction which produces a multi-variate version of the Belinschi-Shlyakhtenko result, together with a result concerning free products of multi-variate noncommutative distributions. Our arguments are based on the combinatorics of the specific types of cumulants used in c-free and in infinitesimal free probability. They work in a rather general setting, where the initial data consists of a vector space $V$ given together with a linear map $\\Delta : V \\to V \\otimes V$. In this setting, all the needed brands of cumulants live in the guise of families of multilinear functionals on $V$, and our main result concerns a certain transformation $\\Delta^{*}$ on such families of multilinear functionals."

We present two main results: a complete classification for the approximability of all maximal constraint languages over domains of cardinality at most 4, and a complete classification of the approximability of the problem when the set of allowed constraints contains all permutation constraints. Under the assumption that a conjecture due to Szczepara holds, we give a complete classification for all maximal constraint languages. These classes of languages are well-studied in universal algebra and computer science; they have, for instance, been considered in connection with machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Our results are proved by using algebraic results from clone theory and the results indicates that this approach is very powerful for classifying the approximability of certain optimisation problems."

It is shown that most capture orbits behave chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the values of $\\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron separation at capture.   If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly bound, highly eccentric phase.   If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.   We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \\& Paczy\\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\\odot$.

        "Abstract": "The effects of the orbital diffusion of stars and clusters on the galactic abundance gradient have been modelled. For a single generation of field stars, the results confirm previous analyses based upon the assumption of a linear gradient with galactocentric distance. Though the dispersion in metallicity at a given radius grows with time, the underlying slope across the disk remains unchanged. For a disk dominated by a discontinuity in [Fe/H] beyond the solar circle, but no gradient within the inner or outer disk, a gradient is derived for any sample whose galactocentric baseline overlaps the discontinuity. The consequence of orbital diffusion is to shift the observable edge of the transition in [Fe/H] to smaller galactocentric distance. In contrast, star clusters of a single generation evaporate so quickly that the small surviving sample of the oldest clusters is statistically insufficient to define any but a linear gradient. Inclusion of multiple generations of stars and clusters with a plausible age-metallicity relation enhances these patterns by expanding the metallicity range at a given galactocentric distance through the inclusion of stars with a wide range in both age and galactocentric origin. For field stars, the metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood is virtually indistinguishable for the two cases modelled. Because ages, abundances, and distances can be reliably determined for clusters and any sample of clusters is invariably dominated by clusters formed over the last 2 Gyrs, the cluster population offers a means for finding detailed structure within the recent galactic abundance gradient. Using clusters to extend the galactocentric baseline would supply an additional critical test of the discontinuity."

Changing the temperature (or the inherent noise of the deposition process) two different regimes with a transition between them at $T_{sr}$, are found: for $T>T_{sr}$ this term is irrelevant and the surface has the scaling properties of a surface growing on a flat substrate in the rough phase. The height-height correlations behave as $C(L,\\tau)\\sim \\ln [L f(\\tau/L^2)]$. While the linear response mobility is finite in this phase it does vanish as $(T-T_{sr})^{1.78}$ when $T\\rightarrow T_{sr}^+$. For $T<T_{sr}$ there is a line of fixed-point for the coupling constant. The surface is super-rough: the equilibrium correlation functions behave as $(\\ln L)^2$ while their short time dependence is $(\\ln \\tau) ^2$ with a temperature dependent dynamic exponent $z=2[1+1.78(1-T/T_{sr})]$.

This algebra admits a unitary representation acting on an Hilbert space which consists in wave packets of spin-networks associated to principal unitary representations of the quantum Lorentz group. This representation is constructed using only Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of a tensor product of a finite dimensional representation with a principal unitary representation. The proof of unitarity of this representation is non trivial and is a consequence of properties of intertwiners which are studied in depth. We analyze the relationship between the insertion of a puncture colored with a principal representation and the presence of a world-line of a massive spinning particle in de Sitter space."

        "Title": "Extended Source Effects in Substructure Lensing",
        "Abstract": "We investigate the extended source size effects on gravitational lensing in which a lens consists of a smooth potential and small mass clumps (``substructure lensing''). We first consider a lens model that consists of a clump modeled as a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and a primary lens modeled as an external background shear and convergence. For this simple model, we derive analytic formulae for (de)magnification of circularly symmetric top-hat sources with three types of parity for their lensed images, namely, positive, negative, and doubly negative parities. Provided that the source size is sufficiently larger than the Einstein radius of the SIS, we find that in the positive (doubly negative) parity case, an extended source is always magnified (demagnified) in comparison with the unperturbed macrolens system, whereas in the negative parity case, the (de)magnification effect, which depends on the sign of convergence minus unity is weaker than those in other parities. It is shown that a measurement of the distortion pattern in a multiply lensed image enables us to break the degeneracy between the lensing effects of clump mass and those of clump distance if lensing parameters of the relevant macrolens model are determined from the position and flux of multiple images. We also show that an actual density profile of a clump can be directly measured by analyzing the ``fine structure'' in a multiply lensed image within the Einstein radius of the clump."

        "Abstract": "As autonomous vehicles (AVs) inch closer to reality, a central requirement for acceptance will be earning the trust of humans in everyday driving situations. In particular, the interaction between AVs and pedestrians is of high importance, as every human is a pedestrian at some point of the day. This paper considers the interaction of a pedestrian and an autonomous vehicle at a mid-block, unsignalized intersection where there is ambiguity over when the pedestrian should cross and when and how the vehicle should yield. By modeling pedestrian behavior through the concept of gap acceptance, the authors show that a hybrid controller with just four distinct modes allows an autonomous vehicle to successfully interact with a pedestrian across a continuous spectrum of possible crosswalk entry behaviors. The controller is validated through extensive simulation and compared to an alternate POMDP solution and experimental results are provided on a research vehicle for a virtual pedestrian."

        "Abstract": "This work presents a fully elaborated ontology, defined via the Ontology Web Language (OWL), of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard to define business process models, and we demonstrate that any BPMN model can be serialized as OWL file. Based on ontological analysis and a corresponding definition of a modeling notation as ontology we show that business process models can be transformed from one notation into another one as long as there are common underlying concepts; this is demonstrated with the case of an actor based, or subject-oriented, view on business processes. Furthermore, a reference architecture for Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) based on microservices is discussed which is capable of executing actor based business process models. As a transformation of BPMN models into the actor based view is generally possible, also BPMN models could be enacted. As a result, we can conclude that the actor system is a promising way to stimulate new ways to design workflow management systems and to design business process modeling languages which are more comfortable to use by non-experts without losing necessary expressiveness. Another result is that an ontology is a productive way to define a modeling notation as it can be used as knowledge base, it is a formal conceptualization of the underlying notions, and can be semantically enriched for further use."

First, we employ the Minty technique and a monotonicity argument to establish an equivalence theorem, which provides three different equivalent formulations of the inequality problem. Without compactness for one of operators in the problem, a general existence theorem for (MVHVI) is proved by using the Fan-Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz principle combined with methods of nonsmooth analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate several crucial properties of the solution set to (MVHVI) which include boundedness, convexity, weak closedness, and continuity. Finally, a uniqueness result with respect to the first component of the solution for the inequality problem is proved by using the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition. All results are obtained in a general functional framework in reflexive Banach spaces."

        "Abstract": "Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible amongst a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a ``selfish agent'', and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents to select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced.   Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m\\gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\\log\\log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\\log\\log m+n^4)$.

The leafwise symplectic form and transverse complex structure determine an obstruction class in a certain cohomology, which vanishes if and only if our question has an affirmative answer. We first study a component of this obstruction, which gives the condition that the leafwise cohomology class of the symplectic form must be transversely pluriharmonic. As a consequence, under certain topological hypotheses, we infer that we actually have a symplectic fibre bundle over a complex base. We then show how to compute the full obstruction via a spectral sequence. We give various concrete necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the obstruction. Throughout, we give examples to test the sharpness of these conditions, including a symplectic fibre bundle over a complex base which does not come from a generalized complex structure, and a regular generalized complex structure which is very unlike a symplectic fibre bundle, i.e., for which nearby leaves are not symplectomorphic."

        "Abstract": "Stochastic mirror descent (SMD) is a fairly new family of algorithms that has recently found a wide range of applications in optimization, machine learning, and control. It can be considered a generalization of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm (SGD), where instead of updating the weight vector along the negative direction of the stochastic gradient, the update is performed in a \"mirror domain\" defined by the gradient of a (strictly convex) potential function. This potential function, and the mirror domain it yields, provides considerable flexibility in the algorithm compared to SGD. While many properties of SMD have already been obtained in the literature, in this paper we exhibit a new interpretation of SMD, namely that it is a risk-sensitive optimal estimator when the unknown weight vector and additive noise are non-Gaussian and belong to the exponential family of distributions. The analysis also suggests a modified version of SMD, which we refer to as symmetric SMD (SSMD). The proofs rely on some simple properties of Bregman divergence, which allow us to extend results from quadratics and Gaussians to certain convex functions and exponential families in a rather seamless way."

However, this law, also known as Archimedes' principle (AP), does not yield the force observed when the body is in contact to the container walls, as is more evident in the case of a block immersed in a liquid and in contact to the bottom, in which a \\emph{downward} force that \\emph{increases with depth} is observed. In this work, by taking into account the surface integral of the pressure force exerted by a fluid over the surface of a body, the general validity of AP is checked. For a body fully surrounded by a fluid, homogeneous or not, a gradient version of the divergence theorem applies, yielding a volume integral that simplifies to an upward force which agrees to the force predicted by AP, as long as the fluid density is a \\emph{continuous function of depth}. For the bottom case, this approach yields a downward force that increases with depth, which contrasts to AP but is in agreement to experiments. It also yields a formula for this force which shows that it increases with the area of contact."

At higher voltages, we observe a saturation of the contact angle caused by the competition between electric and capillary stresses.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of capacity allocation analysis, with the aim of shedding some light on what network architectures focus their modelling capacity on, when used on a given task. We focus more particularly on spatial capacity allocation, which analyzes a posteriori the effective number of parameters that a given model has allocated for modelling dependencies on a given point or region in the input space, in linear settings. We use this framework to perform a quantitative comparison between some classical architectures on various synthetic tasks. Finally, we consider how capacity allocation might translate in non-linear settings."

To demonstrate the huge computational gains we present two benchmark problems in composites: (1) the effects of fibre waviness on the compressive strength of a composite material, (2) uncertain buckling performance of a composite panel with uncertain ply orientations. For our most challenging test case, estimating a rare ($\\sim 1/150$) probability of buckling failure of a composite panel, we see a speed-up factor $> 1000$. Our approach distributed over $1024$ processors reduces the computation time from $218$ days to just $4.5$ hours.

To this end we present a new approach based on a concept of the monomer identity breaking and density functional description. We strictly derive, via a proper choice of basic structural units of the gel fraction, all statements usually supposed to be just Flory (Stockmayer) assumptions. A further analysis of the IC structure reveals some new IC structural units (those involved into mesoscopic cycles) overlooked in both Flory and Stockmayer approaches and to be described by a new order parameter characteristic only of the gel phase. As a result, the SGT is found to transform from a geometric phenomenon to a genuine 1st order phase transition always followed by a phase separation into sol and gel phases. The free energy, total conversion, volume fractions of the gel fraction and dangling monomers as well as other structural quantities are calculated as functions of a reduced monomer density and analyzed for all the existing models. The Flory approach is found to be superior to the Stockmayer-Tanaka one and satisfactorily describe some of the dense weak gel properties but fail (even qualitatively) in a quite extended vicinity of the SGT."

This paper proves that, adopting these extensions, it is possible to define a new convergence of machines (analog computation), algebra (symbolic manipulations) and a well determined class of mathematical objects that gives scope for a constructive foundation of (a part of) infinitesimal calculus without the conceptual need of infinity. To establish this balance, a clear definition of the constructive limits of tractional motion is provided by a differential universality theorem."

By analogy with active galactic nuclei models, it has been proposed that Sgr A* may be a massive accreting black holes. The black hole hypothesis is, however, problematic because no model of Sgr A* has been able to explain the observed spectrum in any self-consistent way, and there is no consensus on either the mass of the black hole or the mass accretion rate. Sgr A* has been observed in the radio, sub-mm, infrared, and X-ray bands, and the various various detections and flux upper limits cover more than ten decades of frequency, from $\\nu\\sles\\ 10^9$ Hz (meter wavelength radio bands) up to $\\nu\\ \\sgreat\\ 10^{19}$ Hz (150 keV X-rays). We present a robust model of Sgr A* in which a million solar mass black hole accretes at the rate of a few $\\times10^{-6}$ solar masses per year. This model fits the entire spectrum self-consistently. The unique feature of the model is that the flow is advection-dominated, i.e. most of the energy viscously dissipated in the differentially rotating flow is carried along with the gas and lost through the horizon. The apparent success of this model in explaining the data may be considered ``proof'' that horizons are real and that a massive black hole does exist at the Galactic center."

(2000). The 3-sigma random noise level of our analysis is 0.00006 stellar continuum flux units, and the confusion noise limit - measuring the resemblence of a cross-correlation feature to the spectrum of methane - is 0.00025.   We find a significant cross-correlation amplitude of 0.00033 continuum units at a velocity near that of the star. This is likely due to methane from a low-mass companion in a long-period orbit. Fischer, Butler and Marcy (2000) report a long-term velocity drift indicative of such a companion. But the system is known to be a visual binary with an eccentric orbit, and is rapidly approaching periastron. Whether the visual companion can account for our observations and the Fischer et al. velocity drift depends on knowing the orbit more precisely. The stability of planetary orbits in this system also depends crucially on the properties of the binary orbit. A second cross-correlation feature, weaker and much more diffuse, has intensity amplitude 0.0002 continuum units and occurs at a velocity amplitude of 71 +/-10 km/sec, in agreement with the orbit claimed for the planet by Cameron et al. (1999). Like the first feature, it has passed several tests designed to reject systematic errors. We discuss the possibility that this second feature is due to the planet."

Here, we generalize these investigations to far from equilibrium settings by evaluating the contributions of electronic resonances to the electronic current noise. Our study extends canonical expressions for the voltage-activated shot noise and the recently discovered delta-T noise to the far from equilibrium regime, when a high bias voltage or a temperature difference is applied. In particular, when the Fermi energy is located on the shoulder of a broad resonance, we arrive at a formula for the shot noise revealing anomalous-nonlinear behavior at high bias voltage."

Common goodness of fit methods are based on the calculation of the distribution of certain statistical quantities under the assumption that the model under consideration {\\it holds true}. This proceeding bears methodological flaws, e.g. a good ``fit'' - albeit the model is wrong - might be due to over-fitting, or to the fact that the chosen statistical criterion is not powerful enough against the present particular deviation between model and true regression function. This causes particular difficulties when models with different numbers of parameters are to be compared. Therefore the number of parameters is often penalised additionally. We provide a methodology which circumvents these problems to some extent. It is based on the consideration of the error distribution of the goodness of fit criterion under a broad range of possible models - and not only under the assumption that a given model holds true.

This constructive dimension is used to assign every individual (infinite, binary) sequence S a dimension, which is a real number dim(S) in the interval [0,1]. Sequences that are random (in the sense of Martin-Lof) have dimension 1, while sequences that are decidable, \\Sigma^0_1, or \\Pi^0_1 have dimension 0. It is shown that for every \\Delta^0_2-computable real number \\alpha in [0,1] there is a \\Delta^0_2 sequence S such that \\dim(S) = \\alpha.   A discrete version of constructive dimension is also developed using termgales, which are supergale-like functions that bet on the terminations of (finite, binary) strings as well as on their successive bits. This discrete dimension is used to assign each individual string w a dimension, which is a nonnegative real number dim(w). The dimension of a sequence is shown to be the limit infimum of the dimensions of its prefixes.   The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is proven to be the product of its length and its dimension. This gives a new characterization of algorithmic information and a new proof of Mayordomo's recent theorem stating that the dimension of a sequence is the limit infimum of the average Kolmogorov complexity of its first n bits.   Every sequence that is random relative to any computable sequence of coin-toss biases that converge to a real number \\beta in (0,1) is shown to have dimension \\H(\\beta), the binary entropy of \\beta."

        "Abstract": "We consider a multi-agent setting with agents exchanging information over a possibly time-varying network, aiming at minimising a separable objective function subject to constraints. To achieve this objective we propose a novel subgradient averaging algorithm that allows for non-differentiable objective functions and different constraint sets per agent, thus expanding the class of problems subgradient/proximal methods can be applied. The latter is a distinctive feature of our approach; we show by means of a counterexample that existing algorithms in the literature may fail to converge if they are adapted to account for a different constraint set per agent. For the proposed iterative scheme we show asymptotic convergence of the iterates to a minimum of the given optimisation problem for step sizes of the form $c(k) = \\frac{\\eta}{k+1}$, for some $\\eta > 0$. Moreover, by restricting the step size choice to $c(k) = \\frac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{k+1}}, \\eta > 0$, we establish a convergence rate of $O\\left( \\frac{ln{k}}{\\sqrt{k}} \\right)$ in objective value. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we investigate a robust regression problem and an $\\ell_2$ regression problem with regularisation."

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a generalization of a Hamilton--Jacobi theory to higher order implicit differential equations. We propose two different backgrounds to deal with higher order implicit Lagrangian theories: the Ostrogradsky approach and the Schmidt transform, which convert a higher order Lagrangian into a first order one. The Ostrogradsky approach involves the addition of new independent variables to account for higher order derivatives, whilst the Schmidt transform adds gauge invariant terms to the Lagrangian function. In these two settings, the implicit character of the resulting equations will be treated in two different ways in order to provide a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. On one hand, the implicit differential equation will be a Lagrangian submanifold of a higher order tangent bundle and it is generated by a Morse family. On the other hand, we will rely on the existence of an auxiliary section of a certain bundle that allows the construction of local vector fields, even if the differential equations are implicit. We will illustrate some examples of our proposed schemes, and discuss the applicability of the proposal."

        "Abstract": "As a research community grows, more and more papers are published each year. As a result there is increasing demand for improved methods for finding relevant papers, automatically understanding the key ideas and recommending potential methods for a target problem. Despite advances in search engines, it is still hard to identify new technologies according to a researcher's need. Due to the large variety of domains and extremely limited annotated resources, there has been relatively little work on leveraging natural language processing in scientific recommendation. In this proposal, we aim at making scientific recommendations by extracting scientific terms from a large collection of scientific papers and organizing the terms into a knowledge graph. In preliminary work, we trained a scientific term extractor using a small amount of annotated data and obtained state-of-the-art performance by leveraging large amount of unannotated papers through applying multiple semi-supervised approaches. We propose to construct a knowledge graph in a way that can make minimal use of hand annotated data, using only the extracted terms, unsupervised relational signals such as co-occurrence, and structural external resources such as Wikipedia. Latent relations between scientific terms can be learned from the graph. Recommendations will be made through graph inference for both observed and unobserved relational pairs."

        "Abstract": "Chandra observations of the compact galaxy group known as Stephan's Quintet (SQ) are presented. The major morphological features that were discovered with the ROSAT HRI are now imaged with higher resolution and S/N. The large scale shock (1.5', ~40kpc if at 85 Mpc) is resolved into a narrow NS feature embedded in more extended diffuse emission (D>=3'). The NS structure is somewhat clumpy, more sharply bounded on the W side and prominent only in the soft band (energies below ~2 keV). Its observational properties are best explained as a shock produced by a high velocity encounter between NGC7318b, a ``new intruder'', and the intergalactic medium in SQ. The shock conditions near the high speed intruder suggest that a bow shock is propagating into a pre-existing HI cloud and heating the gas to a temperature of ~0.5 keV. The low temperature in the shock is a problem unless we postulate an oblique shock. One member, NGC7319, hosts a Seyfert 2 nucleus, with an intrinsic luminosity Lx=10^43 erg/s, embedded in a region of more diffuse emission with 10'' radius extent. The nuclear spectrum can be modeled with a strongly absorbed power-law typical of this class of sources. Several additional compact sources are detected including three in foreground NGC7320. Some of these sources are very luminous and could be related to the ultraluminous X-ray sources found in nearby galaxies."

We also find that the line profile is variable over a timescale of a day or less. The core of the H-alpha line also shows a narrow Zeeman triplet corresponding to a field strength of of about 100kG which appears to be almost constant in shape. These observations suggest that the magnetic field on WD1953-011 has a complex structure and that the star has a rotational period of hours or days which causes the observed variability of the spectra. We argue that neither an offset dipole model nor a double-dipole model are sufficient to explain our observations. Instead, we propose a two component model consisting of a high field region of magnetic field strength of about 500kG covering about 10% of the surface area of the star superimposed on an underlying dipolar field of mean field strength of about 70kG. Radial velocity measurements of the narrow Zeeman triplet show that the radial velocity is constant to within a few km/s so this star is unlikely to be a close binary."

We show that f belongs to exactly three or four irreducible components and study their mutual congruences. In particular, we show that the congruence ideal of one of the CM components has a simple zero at f if, and only if, a certain $L$-invariant $L(\\varphi)$ does not vanish. Further, using Roy's Strong Six Exponential Theorem we show that at least one amongst $L(\\varphi)$ and $L(\\varphi^{-1})$ is non-zero. Combined with a divisibility proved by Hida and Tilouine, we deduce that the anti-cyclotomic Katz p-adic L-function of $\\varphi$ has a simple (trivial) zero at s=0, if $L(\\varphi)$ is non-zero, which can be seen as an anti-cyclotomic analogue of a result of Ferrero and Greenberg. Finally, we propose a formula for the linear term of the two-variable Katz p-adic L-function of $\\varphi$ at s=0 thus extending a conjecture of Gross."

This computing system is based on a passive coherent optical fiber-ring cavity in which part of the nonlinearities are realized by the Kerr nonlinearity. Linear coherent reservoirs can solve difficult tasks but are aided by nonlinear components in their input or output layer. Here, we compare the impact of nonlinear transformations of information in the reservoir input layer, its bulk - the fiber-ring cavity - and its readout layer. For the injection of data into the reservoir, we compare a linear input mapping to the nonlinear transfer function of a Mach Zehnder modulator. For the reservoir bulk, we quantify the impact of the optical Kerr effect. For the readout layer we compare a linear output to a quadratic output implemented by a photodiode. We find that optical nonlinearities in the reservoir itself, such as the optical Kerr nonlinearity studied in the present work, enhance the task solving capability of the reservoir. This suggests that such nonlinearities will play a key role in future coherent all-optical reservoir computers."

        "Abstract": "We study the evidence for a connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) fueling and star formation by investigating the relationship between the X-ray luminosities of AGN and the star formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies. We identify a sample of 309 AGN with $10^{41}<L_\\mathrm{X}<10^{44} $ erg s$^{-1}$ at $0.2 < z < 1.2$ in the PRIMUS redshift survey. We find AGN in galaxies with a wide range of SFR at a given $L_X$. We do not find a significant correlation between SFR and the observed instantaneous $L_X$ for star forming AGN host galaxies. However, there is a weak but significant correlation between the mean $L_\\mathrm{X}$ and SFR of detected AGN in star forming galaxies, which likely reflects that $L_\\mathrm{X}$ varies on shorter timescales than SFR. We find no correlation between stellar mass and $L_\\mathrm{X}$ within the AGN population. Within both populations of star forming and quiescent galaxies, we find a similar power-law distribution in the probability of hosting an AGN as a function of specific accretion rate. Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, we find a star forming galaxy $\\sim2-3$ more likely than a quiescent galaxy to host an AGN of a given specific accretion rate. The probability of a galaxy hosting an AGN is constant across the main sequence of star formation. These results indicate that there is an underlying connection between star formation and the presence of AGN, but AGN are often hosted by quiescent galaxies."

Earlier there was defined a notion of the universal Euler characteristic of an orbifold. It takes values in a ring R, as an abelian group freely generated by the generators, corresponding to the isomorphism classes of finite groups.

TeV gamma-ray measurements of its flaring activity and spectral variability have placed constraints on models of the high-energy emission from blazars. However, observations between 50 and 300 GeV are rare, and the high-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED), predicted to be in this range, has never been directly detected. We present a detection of Mrk 421 above 100 GeV as made by the Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) during a multiwavelength campaign in early 2004. STACEE is a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescope using the wavefront sampling technique to detect gamma rays at lower energies than achieved by most imaging Cherenkov telescopes. We also outline a method for reconstructing gamma-ray energies using a solar heliostat telescope. This technique was applied to the 2004 data, and we present the differential energy spectrum of Mrk 421 above 130 GeV. Assuming a differential photon flux dN/dE proportional to E^-a, we measure a spectral index a = 2.1 +/- 0.2 (statistical) +0.2/-0.1 (systematic). Finally, we discuss the STACEE spectrum in the context of the multiwavelength results from the same epoch."

        "Abstract": "A growth model which describes the deposition of particles (or the growth of a rigid crystal) on a disordered substrate is investigated. The dynamic renormalization group is applied to the stochastic growth equation using the Martin, Sigga, and Rose formalism. The periodic potential and the quenched disorder, upon averaging, are combined into a single term in the generating functional. Changing the temperature (or the inherent noise of the deposition process) two different regimes with a transition between them at $T_{sr}$, are found: for $T>T_{sr}$ this term is irrelevant and the surface has the scaling properties of a surface growing on a flat substrate in the rough phase. The height-height correlations behave as $C(L,\\tau)\\sim \\ln [L f(\\tau/L^2)]$. While the linear response mobility is finite in this phase it does vanish as $(T-T_{sr})^{1.78}$ when $T\\rightarrow T_{sr}^+$. For $T<T_{sr}$ there is a line of fixed-point for the coupling constant. The surface is super-rough: the equilibrium correlation functions behave as $(\\ln L)^2$ while their short time dependence is $(\\ln \\tau) ^2$ with a temperature dependent dynamic exponent $z=2[1+1.78(1-T/T_{sr})]$. While the linear response mobility vanishes on large length scales, its scale-dependence leads to a non-linear response. For a small applied force $F$ the average velocity of the surface $v$ behaves as $v \\sim F^{1+\\zeta}$. To first order $\\zeta=1.78(1-T/T_{sr})$. At the transition, $v\\sim F/(1+C|\\ln (F)|)^{1.78}$ and the crossover to the behavior to $T<T_{sr}$ is analyzed.

For N=3 the transition is very weak and a clear signature of its discontinuous nature is only observed for sizes L>50. We also determine the critical behavior for a large class of lattice Hamiltonians in the large-N limit. The results confirm the existence of a stable large-N CP(N-1) fixed point. However, this evidence contradicts the standard picture obtained in the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) framework using a gauge-invariant order parameter: the presence of a cubic term in the effective LGW field theory for any N>2 would usually be taken as an indication that these models generically undergo first-order transitions."

        "Abstract": "A microscopic model for analyzing the microwave absorption properties of a pinned, two-dimensional Wigner crystal in a strong perpendicular magnetic field is developed. The method focuses on excitations within the lowest Landau level, and corresponds to a quantum version of the harmonic approximation. For pure systems (no disorder), the method reproduces known results for the collective mode density of states of this system, and clearly identifies the origin of previously unexplained structure in this quantity. The application of the method to a simple diagonal disorder model uncovers a surprising result: a sharp (delta-function) response at zero temperature that is consistent with recent experiments. A simple spin lattice model is developed that reproduces the results of the quantum harmonic approximation, and shows that the sharp response is possible because the size scale $L_c$ of patches moving together in the lowest frequency collective mode is extremely large compared to the sample size for physically relevant parameters. This result is found to be a direct repercussion of the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. Finally, the model is used to analyze different disorder potentials that may pin the Wigner crystal, and it is argued that interface disorder is likely to represent the dominant pinning source for the system. A simple model of the interface is shown to reproduce some of the experimental trends for the magnetic field dependence of the pinning resonance."

In particular, we propose the MotionGAN which transforms an input face image into a new one according to a heatmap of target landmarks. We show that it is possible to create very realistic face videos using a single image and a set of target landmarks. Furthermore, our method can be used to edit a facial image with arbitrary motions according to landmarks (e.g., expression, speech, etc.). This provides much more flexibility to face editing, expression transfer, facial video creation, etc. than models based on discrete expressions, audios or action units."

We give a proof of a formula of Frenkel and Zhu for fusion rules. We also give the analogue of the ``Hom''-functor of classical Lie algebra theory for vertex operator algebra theory by introducing a notion of ``generalized intertwining operator.'' We prove that the space of generalized intertwining operators from one module to another for a vertex operator algebra is a generalized module. From this result we derive a general form of Tsuchiya and Kanie's ``nuclear democracy theorem'' for any rational vertex operator algebra. This proves that the fusion rules obtained from our construction of tensor products are the same as the fusion rules obtained by using Tsuchiya and Kanie's method, for both WZW models and minimal models. We prove that if $V$ satisfies certain ``finiteness'' and ``semisimplicity'' conditions, then there exists a unique maximal submodule inside the generalized module. Furthermore, we prove that this maximal submodule is isomorphic to the contragredient module of a certain tensor product module. This gives another construction of tensor product modules and this result turns out to be closely related to Huang and Lepowsky's construction."

Conventional methods for template creation and image alignment to the template have undergone decades of rich technical development. In these frameworks, templates are constructed using an iterative process of template estimation and alignment, which is often computationally very expensive. Due in part to this shortcoming, most methods compute a single template for the entire population of images, or a few templates for specific sub-groups of the data. In this work, we present a probabilistic model and efficient learning strategy that yields either universal or conditional templates, jointly with a neural network that provides efficient alignment of the images to these templates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on a variety of domains, with a special focus on neuroimaging. This is particularly useful for clinical applications where a pre-existing template does not exist, or creating a new one with traditional methods can be prohibitively expensive.

The source faded from an intensity of ~20 mCrab to a minimum of <~0.7 mCrab and then partially recovered towards the end of the observation. This extended minimum lasted ~40,000 seconds. Phase folded light curves at a barycentric rotation period of 124.36568 +/- 0.00020 seconds show that near the center of the extended minimum the source stopped pulsing in the traditional sense but retained a weak dip feature at the rotation period. Away from the extended minimum the dips are progressively narrower at higher energies and may be interpreted as obscurations or eclipses of the hot spot by the accretion column. The pulse profile changed from leading-edge bright before the extended minimum to trailing-edge bright after it. Data from the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) show that a torque reversal occurred <10 days after our observation. Our data indicate that the observed rotation departs from a constant period with a Pdot/P value of ~-1.5% per year at a 4.5 sigma significance. We infer that we may have serendipitously obtained data, with high sensitivity and temporal resolution about the time of an accretion disk spin reversal.

A series of methods have been developed to map a persistence diagram to a vector representation so as to facilitate the downstream use of machine learning tools, and in these approaches, the importance (weight) of different persistence features are often preset. However often in practice, the choice of the weight function should depend on the nature of the specific type of data one considers, and it is thus highly desirable to learn a best weight function (and thus metric for persistence diagrams) from labelled data. We study this problem and develop a new weighted kernel, called WKPI, for persistence summaries, as well as an optimization framework to learn a good metric for persistence summaries. Both our kernel and optimization problem have nice properties. We further apply the learned kernel to the challenging task of graph classification, and show that our WKPI-based classification framework obtains similar or (sometimes significantly) better results than the best results from a range of previous graph classification frameworks on a collection of benchmark datasets."

In this paper, we introduce the concept of capacity allocation analysis, with the aim of shedding some light on what network architectures focus their modelling capacity on, when used on a given task. We focus more particularly on spatial capacity allocation, which analyzes a posteriori the effective number of parameters that a given model has allocated for modelling dependencies on a given point or region in the input space, in linear settings. We use this framework to perform a quantitative comparison between some classical architectures on various synthetic tasks. Finally, we consider how capacity allocation might translate in non-linear settings."

This measurement provides the first independent confirmation of ASCA detections in Seyfert galaxies of broad Fe K-alpha lines that are thought to be the signature of emission from the inner regions of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole. Under the assumption that reflection arises from an isotropic source located above a neutral accretion disk, and using a theoretical model that accounts for the dependence of the reflected spectrum on inclination angle, we derive a 90% confidence range for the disk inclination of i = 50 to 81 degrees. The large inclination is consistent with that expected from the unified model for MCG-5-23-16 based on its Seyfert 1.9 classification. If we assume that the high-energy cutoff in the incident spectrum lies at energies larger than a few hundred keV, then the equivalent width of the Fe K-alpha line is much larger than predicted for the amount of reflection. This implies either an enhanced iron abundance, a covering factor of reflecting material > 0.5, or a cutoff in the incident spectrum at energies between ~60 and ~200 keV."

The large inclination is consistent with that expected from the unified model for MCG-5-23-16 based on its Seyfert 1.9 classification. If we assume that the high-energy cutoff in the incident spectrum lies at energies larger than a few hundred keV, then the equivalent width of the Fe K-alpha line is much larger than predicted for the amount of reflection. This implies either an enhanced iron abundance, a covering factor of reflecting material > 0.5, or a cutoff in the incident spectrum at energies between ~60 and ~200 keV."

        "Title": "Planning coordinated motions for tethered planar mobile robots",
        "Abstract": "This paper considers the motion planning problem for multiple tethered planar mobile robots. Each robot is attached to a fixed base by a flexible cable. Since the robots share a common workspace, the interactions amongst the robots, cables, and obstacles pose significant difficulties for planning. Previous works have studied the problem of detecting whether a target cable configuration is intersecting (or entangled). Here, we are interested in the motion planning problem: how to plan and coordinate the robot motions to realize a given non-intersecting target cable configuration. We identify four possible modes of motion, depending on whether (i) the robots move in straight lines or following their cable lines; (ii) the robots move sequentially or concurrently. We present an in-depth analysis of Straight & Concurrent, which is the most practically-interesting mode of motion. In particular, we propose algorithms that (a) detect whether a given target cable configuration is realizable by a Straight & Concurrent motion, and (b) return a valid coordinated motion plan. The algorithms are analyzed in detail and validated in simulations and in a hardware experiment."

        "Abstract": "We propose the reliability constrained k-rooted minimum spanning forest, a relevant optimization problem whose aim is to find a k-rooted minimum cost forest that connects given customers to a number of supply vertices, in such a way that a minimum required reliability on each path between a customer and a supply vertex is satisfied and the cost is a minimum. The reliability of an edge is the probability that no failure occurs on that edge, whereas the reliability of a path is the product of the reliabilities of the edges in such path. The problem has relevant applications in the design of networks, in fields such as telecommunications, electricity and transports. For its solution, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model, and an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic which invokes several shaking and local search operators. Extensive computational tests prove that the metaheuristic can provide good quality solutions in very short computing times."

        "Abstract": "Sorting and hashing are two completely different concepts in computer science, and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory, and is used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement, and is a common activity performed frequently in a variety of applications.   Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison, and in doing so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity. Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative method for ordering the data than comparison, to exceed the linearithmic time complexity boundary on algorithmic performance.   The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by hashing, which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional sorting algorithm, the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time complexity factor -- even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting."

        "Abstract": "We review the results of a model of how nucleation of a new universe occurs, assuming a di quark identification for soliton-anti soliton constituent parts of a scalar field. Initially, we employ a false vacuum potential system; however ,when cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein cosmological constant at the end of chaotic inflation, the initial di quark scalar field is not consistent with respect to a semi classical consistency conditions we analyze as the potential changes to the chaotic inflationary potential utilized by Guth. We use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero during initial inflationary cosmology, and obtain a sound speed approaching unity as the slope of the scalar field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All this is to aid in a data reconstruction problem of how to account for the initial origins of CMB due to dark matter since effective field theories as presently constructed require a cut off value for applicability of their potential structure. This is often at the cost of, especially in early universe theoretical models, of clearly defined baryogenesis, and of a well defined mechanism of phase transitions."

        "Abstract": "OGTT is a common test, frequently used to diagnose insulin resistance or diabetes, in which a patient's blood sugar is measured at various times over the course of a few hours. Recent developments in the study of OGTT results have framed it as an inverse problem which has been the subject of Bayesian inference. This is a powerful new tool for analyzing the results of an OGTT test,and the question arises as to whether the test itself can be improved. It is of particular interest to discover whether the times at which a patient's glucose is measured can be changed to improve the effectiveness of the test. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of finding a better experimental design, that is, a set of times to perform the test. We review the theory of Bayesian experimental design and propose an estimator for the expected utility of a design. We then study the properties of this estimator and propose a new method for quantifying the uncertainty in comparisons between designs. We implement this method to find a new design and the proposed design is compared favorably to the usual testing scheme."

        "Abstract": "Let $K$ be the function field of a $p$-adic curve, $G$ a semisimple simply connected group over $K$ and $X$ a $G$-torsor over $K$. A conjecture of Colliot-Th\\'el\\`ene, Parimala and Suresh predicts that if for every discrete valuation $v$ of $K$, $X$ has a point over the completion $K_v$, then $X$ has a $K$-rational point. The main result of this paper is the proof of this conjecture for groups of some classical types. In particular, we prove the conjecture when $G$ is of one of the following types: (1) ${}^2A_n^*$, i.e. $G=\\mathbf{SU}(h)$ is the special unitary group of some hermitian form $h$ over a pair $(D, \\tau)$, where $D$ is a central division algebra of square-free index over a quadratic extension $L$ of $K$ and $\\tau$ is an involution of the second kind on $D$ such that $L^{\\tau}=K$; (2) $B_n$, i.e., $G=\\mathbf{Spin}(q)$ is the spinor group of quadratic form of odd dimension over $K$; (3) $D_n^*$, i.e., $G=\\mathbf{Spin}(h)$ is the spinor group of a hermitian form $h$ over a quaternion $K$-algebra $D$ with an orthogonal involution. Our method actually yields a parallel local-global result over the fraction field of a 2-dimensional, henselian, excellent local domain with finite residue field, under suitable assumption on the residue characteristic."

Modeling of the H2O spectra using a homogeneous model with a constant excitation temperature T_ex shows that the H2O abundances increase with temperature, up to a few times 10^-5 with respect to H2 for the hottest sources (T_ex ~500 K). This is still a factor of 10 lower than the H2O ice abundances observed toward cold sources in which evaporation is not significant (Keane et al. 2001). Gas-phase CO2 is not abundant in our sources. The abundances are nearly constant for T_ex>~100 K at a value of a few times 10^-7, much lower than the solid-state abundances of ~1--3 times 10^-6 (Gerakines et al. 1999). For both H2O and CO2 the gas/solid ratio increases with temperature, but the increase is much stronger for H2O than for CO2, suggesting a different type of chemistry. In addition to the homogeneous models, a power law model has been developed for one of our sources, based on the physical structure of this region as determined from submillimeter data by van der Tak et al.

We present here a study of HCG~54 based on deep optical images and spectroscopy as well as high spatial and spectral resolution HI observations obtained at the VLA. Both optical and radio data indicate clearly that HCG~54 is a product of a recent merger involving at least two galaxies. Our optical images have revealed a blue elongated structure associated with HCG 54a embedded in a rounder and redder stellar envelope. Several ripples or shells whose center is located near HCG 54a and b are also detected. These observed features are similar to those found in the numerical simulations of tidal interactions involving two equal mass disk galaxies. This system is embedded in an HI cloud 12 kpc in diameter, and a 20 kpc HI tidal tail emerges from its western edge. Both the HI distribution and kinematics are consistent with a recent history of a deeply penetrating interaction or a merger. Based on the analysis of our new data we propose that HCG 54 is the remnant of a merger in an advanced stage, whose main body is what has been called HCG 54a, while HCG 54b marks the location of a strong starburst induced by the interaction, as evidenced by the Wolf Rayet stellar population that we detect. Optical spectra of HCG 54c and d show HII region features and are interpreted as tidal debris of the collision undergoing active star formation."

        "Abstract": "On a lattice, as the momentum space is compact, the kinetic energy is bounded not only from below but also from above. It is shown that this, somehow removes the distinction between repulsive and attractive forces. In particular, it is seen that a region with attractive force would appear forbidden for states with energies higher than a certain value, while repulsive forces could develop bound-states. An explicit transformation is introduced which transforms the spectrum of a system corresponding to a repulsive force, to that of a similar system corresponding to an attractive force. Explicit numerical examples are presented for discrete energies of bound-states of a particle experiencing repulsive force by a piecewise constant potential. Finally, the parameters of a specific one dimensional translationally invariant system on continuum are tuned so that the energy of the system resembles the kinetic energy of a system on a one dimensional lattice. In particular, it is shown that the parameters could be tuned so that while the width of the first energy band and its position are kept finite, the energy gap between the first energy band and the next energy band go to infinity, so that effectively only the first energy band is relevant."

We first tested it on noisy synthetic spectra of A, F, G, and K-type stars, and inverted simultaneously their atmospheric fundamental parameters: Teff, log g, [M/H] and vsini. Different learning databases were calculated using a range of sampling in Teff, log g, vsini, and [M/H]. Combined with a principal component analysis (PCA) nearest neighbors (NN) search, the size of the learning database is reduced. A Tikhonov regularization is applied, given the ill-conditioning of SIR. For all spectral types, decreasing the size of the learning database allowed us to reach internal accuracies better than PCA-based NN-search using larger learning databases. For each analyzed parameter, we have reached internal errors that are smaller than the sampling step of the parameter. We have also applied the technique to a sample of observed FGK and A stars. For a selection of well studied stars, the inverted parameters are in agreement with the ones derived in previous studies. The RSIR inversion technique, complemented with PCA pre-processing proves to be efficient in estimating stellar parameters of A, F, G, and K stars."

In the class of games we consider, there is a hierarchical game being played between a leader and a follower with continuous action spaces. We show that in zero-sum games, the only stable attractors of the Stackelberg gradient dynamics are Stackelberg equilibria. This insight allows us to develop a gradient-based update for the leader that converges to Stackelberg equilibria in zero-sum games and the set of stable attractors in general-sum games. We then consider a follower employing a gradient-play update rule instead of a best response strategy and propose a two-timescale algorithm with similar asymptotic convergence results. For this algorithm, we also provide finite-time high probability bounds for local convergence to a neighborhood of a stable Stackelberg equilibrium in general-sum games."

They are multivariate polynomials whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a Reed-Solomon code. We consider a generalization of their construction, which we call lifted multiplicity codes. These are multivariate polynomial codes whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a multiplicity code (Kopparty, Saraf, Yekhanin 2014). We show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and a notion of locality called the $t$-disjoint-repair-group property than previously known constructions. More precisely, we show that lifted multiplicity codes with length $N$ and redundancy $O(t^{0.585} \\sqrt{N})$ have the property that any symbol of a codeword can be reconstructed in $t$ different ways, each using a disjoint subset of the other coordinates. This gives the best known trade-off for this problem for any super-constant $t < \\sqrt{N}$. We also give an alternative analysis of lifted Reed Solomon codes using dual codes, which may be of independent interest."

The corresponding moduli spaces are smooth, but they are not all isomorphic; some are finite etale covers of others. We describe the web of interconnections between these spaces, and give monodromy, rationality, and Prym-related consequences. Enumerative consequences include: (i) the degree of this locus is 3762 (e.g. there are 3762 rational elliptic fibrations with nodes above 11 given general points of the base); (ii) if C --> P^1 is a cover as in (D), then there are 135 different such covers branched at the same points; (iii) the general set of 12 tangent lines that arises in (C) turns up in 120 essentially different ways.   Some parts of this story are well-known, and some other parts were known classically (to Zeuthen, Zariski, Coble, Mumford, and others).

The dynamic renormalization group is applied to the stochastic growth equation using the Martin, Sigga, and Rose formalism. The periodic potential and the quenched disorder, upon averaging, are combined into a single term in the generating functional. Changing the temperature (or the inherent noise of the deposition process) two different regimes with a transition between them at $T_{sr}$, are found: for $T>T_{sr}$ this term is irrelevant and the surface has the scaling properties of a surface growing on a flat substrate in the rough phase. The height-height correlations behave as $C(L,\\tau)\\sim \\ln [L f(\\tau/L^2)]$. While the linear response mobility is finite in this phase it does vanish as $(T-T_{sr})^{1.78}$ when $T\\rightarrow T_{sr}^+$. For $T<T_{sr}$ there is a line of fixed-point for the coupling constant. The surface is super-rough: the equilibrium correlation functions behave as $(\\ln L)^2$ while their short time dependence is $(\\ln \\tau) ^2$ with a temperature dependent dynamic exponent $z=2[1+1.78(1-T/T_{sr})]$. While the linear response mobility vanishes on large length scales, its scale-dependence leads to a non-linear response. For a small applied force $F$ the average velocity of the surface $v$ behaves as $v \\sim F^{1+\\zeta}$. To first order $\\zeta=1.78(1-T/T_{sr})$. At the transition, $v\\sim F/(1+C|\\ln (F)|)^{1.78}$ and the crossover to the behavior to $T<T_{sr}$ is analyzed.

Addition of salt is treated implicitly through a screened Coulomb potential for the electrostatic interactions.   For the flexible model the electrostatic persistence length shows roughly three regimes in its dependence on the Debye-H\\\"{u}ckel screening length, $\\kappa^{-1}$.As long as the salt content is low and $\\kappa^{-1}$ is longer than the end-to-end distance, the electrostatic persistence length varies only slowly with $\\kappa^{-1}$. Decreasing the screening length, a controversial region is entered. We find that the electrostatic persistence length scales as $sqrt{\\xi_p}/\\kappa$, in agreement with experiment on flexible polyelectrolytes, where $\\xi_p$ is a strength parameter measuring the electrostatic interactions within the polyelectrolyte. For screening lengths much shorter than the bond length, the $\\kappa^{-1}$ dependence becomes quadratic in the variational calculation. The simulations suffer from numerical problems in this regime, but seem to give a relationship half-way between linear and quadratic.   A low temperature expansion only reproduces the first regime and a high temperature expansion, which treats the electrostatic interactions as a perturbation to a Gaussian chain, gives a quadratic dependence on the Debye length.   For a sufficiently stiff chain, the persistence length varies quadratically with $\\kappa^{-1}$ in agreement with earlier theories."

The association of a quadratic bundle to its even Clifford algebra induces a natural bijection from the set of equivalence classes of line-bundle-valued quadratic forms on rank 3 vector bundles upto tensoring by twisted discriminant bundles and the set of isomorphism classes of schematic specialisations of rank 4 Azumaya bundles over any fixed scheme X. This statement is a limiting version of the following statement: the set of orbits of Disc(X) in the 1-cohomology of X in the fppf topology with values in O(3) is in bijection with the 1-cohomology with values in PGL(2). The various orthogonal groups of a quadratic bundle are canonically determined in terms of the automorphisms of its even Clifford algebra. Any automorphism of the latter arises from a similarity, and in fact from an orthogonal transformation if its determinant is a square. The special orthogonal group is thus identified with the subgroup of automorphisms with trivial determinant. A specialised algebra arises from a honest quadratic form iff its determinant has a square root and arises from a bilinear form iff the line subbundle generated by 1 is a direct summand."

We show that these are symmetric and Schur-positive via a variant of the Robinson--Schenstedt--Knuth correspondence and we also describe crystal raising- and lowering operators for the underlying fillings.

Bulk Comptonization of disc photons is shown to yield a spectral component contributing in the far UV band, and would then be currently unobservable. On the contrary, the bulk Comptonization of broad line photons may yield a significant feature in the soft X-ray band. Such a feature is time-dependent and transient, and dominates over the non thermal continuum only when: a) the dissipation occurs close to, but within, the broad line region; b) other competing processes, like the synchrotron self-Compton emission, yield a negligible flux in the X-ray band. The presence of a bulk Compton component may account for the X-ray properties of high redshift blazars that show a flattening (and possibly a hump) in the soft X-rays, previously interpreted as due to intrinsic absorption. We discuss why the conditions leading to a detectable bulk Compton feature might be met only occasionally in high redshift blazars, concluding that the absence of such a feature in the spectra of most blazars should not be taken as evidence against matter--dominated relativistic jets. The detection of such a component carries key information on the bulk Lorentz factor and kinetic energy associated to (cold) leptons."

Here we show that the activity-induced radial-velocity fluctuations are reduced when we apply a kernel regression to these activity indicators. The disc-averaged magnetic flux proves to be the best activity proxy over a timescale of one month and gives a standard deviation of the regression residuals of 1.04 m/s, more than a factor of 2.8 smaller than the standard deviation of the original radial velocity fluctuations. This result has been achieved thanks to the high-cadence and time continuity of the observations that simultaneously sample both the radial velocity and the activity proxies."

I consider an axisymmetric force-free magnetically-linked star--disk configuration and investigate the expansion of the poloidal field lines and partial field-line opening caused by the differential rotation between the star and a nonuniformly-rotating disk. I present a simple analytical model that describes the asymptotic behavior of the field in the strong-expansion limit. I demonstrate the existence of a finite (of order one radian) critical twist angle, beyond which the poloidal field starts inflating very rapidly. If the relative star--disk twist is enhanced locally, in some finite part of the disk (which may be the case for a Keplerian disk that extends inward significantly closer to the central star than the corotation radius), then, as the twist is increased by a finite amount, the field approaches a partially-open configuration, with some field lines going out to infinity. Simultaneous with this partial field opening, a very thin, radially extended current layer forms, thus laying out a way towards reconnection in the disk magnetosphere. Reconnection, in turn, leads to a very interesting scenario for a quasi-periodic behavior of magnetically-linked star--disk systems with successive cycles of field inflation, opening, and reconnection."

The inner binary is a double-lined spectroscopic binary composed of two B7 V stars.

The inner binary possesses an essentially circular orbit (e = 0.01) while the outer binary has an eccentric orbit (e = 0.48). From the widths of their Si II 6371 A lines, the vsini's were calculated to be 46 +/- 7 km s^-1 for zeta^2 CrB A and 7.5 +/- 2 km s^-1 for zeta^2 CrB B. As zeta^2 CrB A & B have similar masses, their different rotational velocities make this system a sensitive test of synchronization theories."

        "Title": "Pronounced drop of $^{17}$O NMR Knight shift in superconducting state of  Sr$_2$RuO$_4$",
        "Abstract": "The superconducting state in the quasi-two-dimensional and strongly correlated Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is uniquely held up as a solid state analog to superfluid $^3$He-$A$, with an odd-parity order parameter that also breaks time reversal symmetry, and for which the vector order parameter has the same direction in spin space for all electron momenta. The recent discovery that uniaxial pressure causes a steep rise and maximum in transition temperature ($T_c$) in strained samples motivated the study of $^{17}$O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that we describe in this article. A reduction of Knight shifts $K$ was observed for all strain values and temperatures $T<T_c$, consistent with a drop in spin polarization in the superconducting state. In unstrained samples, our results are in contradiction with a body of previous NMR work, and with the most prominent previous proposals for the order parameter of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Possible alternative scenarios are discussed."

        "Abstract": "To date, in almost all strong gravitational lensing analyses for modeling giant arc systems and multiple quasar images, it has been assumed that all the deflecting matter is concentrated in one lens plane at a certain distance - the thin lens approximation. However, in a few observed cases, lenses at more than one redshift have been identified as contributing to the image splitting.   Here we report on a quantitative investigation of the importance and frequency of significant multiple lensing agents. We use multi-lens plane simulations to evaluate how frequently two or more lens planes combined are essential for multiple imaging, as compared with the cases where a single lens plane alone provides enough focusing to be supercritical.   We find that the fraction of cases for which more than one lens plane contributes significantly to a multi-image lensing situation is a strong function of source redshift. For sources at redshift unity, 95% of lenses involve only a single mass concentration, but for a more typical scenario with, e.g., a source at a redshift of z_s = 3.8, as many as 38% of the strongly lensed quasars/arcs occur because of a significant matter contribution from one or more ADDITIONAL lens planes. In the 30% to 40% of cases when additional planes make a significant contribution, the surface mass density of the primary lens will be overestimated by about 15% to 20%, if the additional contributions are not recognized."

        "Abstract": "Assuming that the interchange convection of magnetic flux elements is the physical cause for the existence of filamentary penumbrae in sunspots, we investigate the behavior of an individual fibril embedded in the deep penumbra. The fibril is approximated by a thin magnetic flux tube which evolves dynamically in the environment given by the global magnetostatic model of a sunspot.   Our simulation shows that the flux tube, initially positioned at the penumbra--quiet Sun boundary in the model, will rise through its deep penumbra developing a flow along the tube that points upward beneath the photosphere, and radially outward above the photosphere. Our results suggest that a bright filament may be formed by an extended tail of a penumbral grain. Such filaments are optically thick, hotter than the surroundings, and elevated above a darker background. An upflow in penumbral grains bends horizontally outwards above the photosphere and gradually cools down due to radiative losses leading to a tail that gradually darkens. The plasma flow inside the flux tube then becomes transparent and the tube constitutes a thin elevated flow channel, that can reproduce the observed features of the Evershed effect. We present also a new acceleration mechanism for the Evershed flow. It is demonstrated that a local surplus of gas pressure develops inside the tube as it rises through the specific (superadiabatic and magnetized) penumbral background. The resulting gradient of the gas pressure can drive the flow along the tube."

Traditionally, it was assumed, that a spin wave in a magnetic film with spin-sink-free surfaces can transfer energy and angular momentum only along its propagation direction. In this work, using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in combination with a theory of dipole-exchange spin-wave spectra, we show that in obliquely magnetized free magnetic films the in-plane propagation of spin waves is accompanied by a transverse spin current along the film normal without any corresponding transverse transport of energy."

        "Abstract": "We study the time dependent spectra produced via the bulk Compton process by a cold, relativistic shell of plasma moving (and accelerating) along the jet of a blazar, scattering on external photons emitted by the accretion disc and reprocessed in the broad line region. Bulk Comptonization of disc photons is shown to yield a spectral component contributing in the far UV band, and would then be currently unobservable. On the contrary, the bulk Comptonization of broad line photons may yield a significant feature in the soft X-ray band. Such a feature is time-dependent and transient, and dominates over the non thermal continuum only when: a) the dissipation occurs close to, but within, the broad line region; b) other competing processes, like the synchrotron self-Compton emission, yield a negligible flux in the X-ray band. The presence of a bulk Compton component may account for the X-ray properties of high redshift blazars that show a flattening (and possibly a hump) in the soft X-rays, previously interpreted as due to intrinsic absorption. We discuss why the conditions leading to a detectable bulk Compton feature might be met only occasionally in high redshift blazars, concluding that the absence of such a feature in the spectra of most blazars should not be taken as evidence against matter--dominated relativistic jets. The detection of such a component carries key information on the bulk Lorentz factor and kinetic energy associated to (cold) leptons."

The final single-letter expression has a very simple form, which was made possible by many novel elements such as a unified framework that represents various network problems in a simple and unified way, a unified coding strategy that consists of a few basic ingredients but can emulate many known coding techniques if needed, and new proof techniques beyond the use of standard covering and packing lemmas. For example, in our framework, sources, channels, states and side information are treated in a unified way and various constraints such as cost and distortion constraints are unified as a single joint-typicality constraint.   Our theorem can be useful in proving many new achievability results easily and in some cases gives simpler rate expressions than those obtained using conventional approaches. Furthermore, our unified coding can strictly outperform existing schemes. For example, we obtain a generalized decode-compress-amplify-and-forward bound as a simple corollary of our main theorem and show it strictly outperforms previously known coding schemes. Using our unified framework, we formally define and characterize three types of network duality based on channel input-output reversal and network flow reversal combined with packing-covering duality."

        "Abstract": "The local Larmor clock is used to derive a hierarchy of local densities of states. At the bottom of this hierarchy are the partial density of states for which represent the contribution to the local density of states if both the incident and outgoing scattering channel are prescribed. On the next higher level is the injectivity which represents the contribution to the local density of states if only the incident channel is prescribed regardless of the final scattering channel. The injectivity is related by reciprocity to the emissivity of a point into a quantum channel. The sum of all partial density of states or the sum of all injectivities or the sum of all emissivities is equal to the local density of states. The use of the partial density of states is illustrated for a number of different electron transport problems in mesoscopic physics: The transmission from a tunneling tip into a mesoscopic conductor, the discussion of inelastic or phase breaking scattering with a voltage probe, and the ac-conductance of mesoscopic conductors. The transition from a capacitive response (positive time-delay) to an inductive response (negative time-delay) for a quantum point contact is used to illustrate the difficulty in associating time-scales with a linear response analysis. A brief discussion of the off-diagonal elements of a partial density of states matrix is presented. The off-diagonal elements permit to investigate carrier fluctuations away from the average carrier density. The work concludes with a discussion of the relation between the partial density of states matrix and the Wigner-Smith delay time matrix."

The most massive of the three stars, K2-giant HD 240237, has a 5.3 MJ minimum mass companion orbiting the star at a 746-day period. The K0-giant BD +48 738 is orbited by a > 0.91 MJ planet which has a period of 393 days and shows a non-linear, long-term radial velocity trend that indicates a presence of another, more distant companion, which may have a substellar mass or be a low-mass star. The K2-giant HD 96127, has a > 4.0 MJ mass companion in a 647-day orbit around the star. The two K2-giants exhibit a significant RV noise that complicates the detection of low-amplitude, periodic variations in the data. If the noise component of the observed RV variations is due to solar-type oscillations, we show, using all the published data for the substellar companions to giants, that its amplitude is anti-correlated with stellar metallicity."

For coupled three qubits interacting with a photon field, a realizable scheme for a single-step Toffoli gate is investigated. We find that the three qubit system can be described by four effective modified Jaynes-Cummings models in the states of two control qubits. Within the rotating wave approximation, the modified Jaynes-Cummings models are shown to be reduced to the conventional Jaynes-Cummings models with renormalized couplings between qubits and photon fields. A single-step Toffoli gate is shown to be realizable with tuning the four characteristic oscillation periods that satisfy a commensurate condition. Possible values of system parameters are estimated for single-step Toffli gate. From numerical calculation, further, our single-step Toffoli gate operation errors are discussed due to imperfections in system parameters, which shows that a Toffoli gate with high fidelity can be obtained by adjusting pairs of the photon-qubit and the qubit-qubit coupling strengthes. In addition, a decoherence effect on the Toffoli gate operation is discussed due to a thermal reservoir."

        "Abstract": "The recent observation of the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 shows a galaxy may lack dark matter. Usually dark matter is much more abundant than stellar in galaxy environment. This dark matter to baryon mass ratio is generally larger than the cosmological ratio of about five, since a significant part of baryon is diffused in the form of intergalactic medium. How to achieve such a low dark matter to baryon mass ratio is a challenge to the standard galaxy formation mechanism. Here we show that such a low ratio can be a natural consequence if the NGC 1052-DF2 had experienced a single passage within a few kpcs to the center of galaxy NGC 1052. The tidal effect of NGC 1052 in the encounter will heat the NGC 1052-DF2 up, stretch the previous dwarf galaxy significantly into its current size. The relative lacking of dark matter in the observed region is a natural consequence of the dark matter extended distribution and relatively less concentration in the corresponding central region before encounter, together with a systematic underestimation of the trace mass estimator method during relaxation after encounter. The observed flat distribution of the ultra-diffuse galaxy can be reproduced. Our results shows no need of introducing any new physical mechanism."

The inner section of this SNR, within 2 degrees of the pulsar PSR B0833-45, has been observed by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray atmospheric Cherenkov detector in 2004 and 2005. A strong signal is seen from an extended region to the south of the pulsar, within an integration region of radius 0.8 deg. around the position (RA = 08h 35m 00s, dec = -45 deg. 36' J2000.0). The excess coincides with a region of hard X-ray emission seen by the ROSAT and ASCA satellites. The observed energy spectrum of the source between 550 GeV and 65 TeV is well fit by a power law function with photon index = 1.45 +/- 0.09(stat) +/- 0.2(sys) and an exponential cutoff at an energy of 13.8 +/- 2.3(stat) +/- 4.1(sys) TeV. The integral flux above 1 TeV is (1.28 +/- 0.17 (stat) +/- 0.38(sys)) x 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. This result is the first clear measurement of a peak in the spectral energy distribution from a VHE gamma-ray source, likely related to inverse Compton emission. A fit of an Inverse Compton model to the H.E.S.S. spectral energy distribution gives a total energy in non-thermal electrons of ~2 x 10^{45} erg between 5 TeV and 100 TeV, assuming a distance of 290 parsec to the pulsar. The best fit electron power law index is 2.0, with a spectral break at 67 TeV."

To relieve this pressure, this paper studies a car-pooling platform that would match riders and drivers, while guaranteeing a ride back and exploiting spatial and temporal locality. In particular, the paper formalizes the Commute Trip Sharing Problem (CTSP) to find a routing plan that maximizes ride sharing for a set of commute trips. The CTSP is a generalization of the vehicle routing problem with routes that satisfy time window, capacity, pairing, precedence, ride duration, and driver constraints. The paper introduces two exact algorithms for the CTPS: A route-enumeration algorithm and a branch-and-price algorithm. Experimental results show that, on a high-fidelity, real-world dataset of commute trips from a mid-size city, both algorithms optimally solve small and medium-sized problems and produce high-quality solutions for larger problem instances. The results show that car pooling, if widely adopted, has the potential to reduce vehicle usage by up to 57% and decrease vehicle miles traveled by up to 46% while only incurring a 22% increase in average ride time per commuter for the trips considered."

We show that this problem is NP-Hard, and present a complete, optimal algorithm that solves it using a branch-and-bound strategy. The algorithm runs in exponential time in the worst case, but solves typical problems with practical speed.

The absence of inversion symmetry is very uncommon in metals, particularly metallic oxides. In contrast to the recently reported ferroelectric-like structural transition in LiOsO3, the phase transition in Pb2CoOsO6 is driven by a long-range collinear antiferromagnetic order, with propagation vector k = ( 1/2 , 0, 1/2 ), which relieves the frustration associated with the magnetic exchanges.

We construct an explanatory graph to organize the mined part patterns, where a node represents a part pattern, and each edge encodes co-activation relationships and spatial relationships between patterns. More crucially, given a pre-trained CNN, the explanatory graph is learned without a need of annotating object parts. Experiments show that each graph node consistently represented the same object part through different images, which boosted the transferability of CNN features. We transferred part patterns in the explanatory graph to the task of part localization, and our method significantly outperformed other approaches."

We start with a root node containing all the particles and then recursively divide each node into two nodes each containing roughly equal number of particles,until each of the nodes contains only one particle. The volume of such a leaf node provides an estimate of the local density. We implement an entropy-based node splitting criterion that results in a significant improvement in the estimation of densities compared to earlier work. The method is completely metric free and can be applied to arbitrary number of dimensions. We apply this method to determine the phase space densities of dark matter halos obtained from cosmological N-body simulations. We find that contrary to earlier studies, the volume distribution function $v(f)$ of phase space density $f$ does not have a constant slope but rather a small hump at high phase space densities. We demonstrate that a model in which a halo is made up by a superposition of Hernquist spheres is not capable in explaining the shape of $v(f)$ vs $f$ relation, whereas a model which takes into account the contribution of the main halo separately roughly reproduces the behavior as seen in simulations. The use of the presented method is not limited to calculation of phase space densities, but can be used as a general-purpose data-mining tool and due to its speed and accuracy it is ideally suited for analysis of large multidimensional data sets."

We identify broad relativistic reflection features in a soft disc-dominated spectrum. A strong and variable power-law component of emission is present which we use to demonstrate that enhanced Comptonisation strengthens disc reflection. We constrain the spin parameter of the black hole by modelling LMC X-1's broad reflection features. For our primary and most comprehensive spectral model, we obtain a high value for the spin: a* = 0.97(+0.01,-0.13) (68 per cent confidence). However, by additionally considering two alternate models as a measure of our systematic uncertainty, we obtain a broader constraint: a* = 0.97(+0.02,-0.25). Both of these spin values are entirely consistent with a previous estimate of spin obtained using the continuum-fitting method. At 99 per cent confidence, the reflection features require a* > 0.2. In addition to modelling the relativistically broadened reflection, we also model a sharp and prominent reflection component that provides strong evidence for substantial reprocessing in the wind of the massive companion. We infer that this wind sustains the ionisation cone surrounding the binary system; this hypothesis naturally produces appropriate and consistent mass, time, and length scales for the cone structure."

        "Abstract": "The sudden reconnection of a non-force free 2D current layer, embedded in a low-beta plasma, triggered by the onset of an anomalous resistivity, is studied in detail. The resulting behaviour consists of two main phases. Firstly, a transient reconnection phase, in which the current in the layer is rapidly dispersed and some flux is reconnected. This dispersal of current launches a family of small amplitude magnetic and plasma perturbations, which propagate away from the null at the local fast and slow magnetosonic speeds. The vast majority of the magnetic energy released in this phase goes into internal energy of the plasma, and only a tiny amount is converted into kinetic energy. In the wake of the outwards propagating pulses, an imbalance of Lorentz and pressure forces creates a stagnation flow which drives a regime of impulsive bursty reconnection, in which fast reconnection is turned on and off in a turbulent manner as the current density exceeds and falls below a critical value. During this phase, the null current density is continuously built up above a certain critical level, then dissipated very rapidly, and built up again, in a stochastic manner. Interestingly, the magnetic energy converted during this quasi-steady phase is greater than that converted during the initial transient reconnection phase. Again essentially all the energy converted during this phase goes directly to internal energy. These results are of potential importance for solar flares and coronal heating, and set a conceptually important reference for future 3D studies."

Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has attracted research interest as an approach for leveraging the hierarchical structure of a given task in reinforcement learning (RL). However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that enhances the performance of RL is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an HRL method that learns a latent variable of a hierarchical policy using mutual information maximization. Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling. In our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy. Experimental results indicate that our HRL approach can learn a diversity of options and that it can enhance the performance of RL in continuous control tasks."

Recent rich observations of GRBs by space missions such as Swift and Fermi pose new constraints on GRB central engine models. In this paper, we study the baryon loading processes of a GRB jet launched from a black hole central engine. We consider a relativistic jet powered by $\\nu \\bar\\nu$-annihilation or by the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We consider baryon loading from a neutrino-driven wind from a neutrino-cooling-dominated accretion flow. For a magnetically dominated BZ jet, we consider neutron-drifting from the magnetic wall surrounding the jet and subsequent positron capture and proton-neutron inelastic collisions. The minumim baryon loads in both types of jet are calculated. We find that in both cases, a more luminous jet tends to be more baryon poor. A neutrino-driven \"fireball\" is typically \"dirtier\" than a magnetically dominated jet, while a magnetically dominated jet can be much cleaner. Both models have the right scaling to interpret the empirical $\\Gamma-L_{\\rm iso}$ relation discovered recently. Since some neutrino-driven jets have too much baryon loading as compared with the data, we suggest that at least a good fraction of GRBs should have a magnetically dominated central engine."

The key observation is that C(A) is the homogeneous coordinate ring associated to a nef but not ample divisor on the blowup of P^2 at the singular points of A."

        "Title": "A Unified Approach to Dynamic Decision Problems with Asymmetric  Information - Part I: Non-Strategic Agents",
        "Abstract": "We study a general class of dynamic multi-agent decision problems with asymmetric information and non-strategic agents, which includes dynamic teams as a special case. When agents are non-strategic, an agent's strategy is known to the other agents. Nevertheless, the agents' strategy choices and beliefs are interdependent over times, a phenomenon known as signaling. We introduce the notions of private information that effectively compresses the agents' information in a mutually consistent manner. Based on the notions of sufficient information, we propose an information state for each agent that is sufficient for decision making purposes. We present instances of dynamic multi-agent decision problems where we can determine an information state with a time-invariant domain for each agent. Furthermore, we present a generalization of the policy-independence property of belief in Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to dynamic multi-agent decision problems. Within the context of dynamic teams with asymmetric information, the proposed set of information states leads to a sequential decomposition that decouples the interdependence between the agents' strategies and beliefs over time, and enables us to formulate a dynamic program to determine a globally optimal policy via backward induction."

        "Title": "Thermodynamics of beta-amyloid fibril formation",
        "Abstract": "Amyloid fibers are aggregates of proteins. They are built out of a peptide called $\\beta$--amyloid (A$\\beta$) containing between 41 and 43 residues, produced by the action of an enzyme which cleaves a much larger protein known as the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). X-ray diffraction experiments have shown that these fibrils are rich in $\\beta$--structures, whereas the shape of the peptide displays an $\\alpha$--helix structure within the APP in its biologically active conformation. A realistic model of fibril formation is developed based on the seventeen residues A$\\beta$12--28 amyloid peptide, which has been shown to form fibrils structurally similar to those of the whole A$\\beta$ peptide. With the help of physical arguments and in keeping with experimental findings, the A$\\beta$12--28 monomer is assumed to be in four possible states (i.e., native helix conformation, $\\beta$--hairpin, globular low--energy state and unfolded state). Making use of these monomeric states, oligomers (dimers, tertramers and octamers) were constructed. With the help of short, detailed Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations of the three monomers and of a variety of oligomers, energies for these structures were obtained. Making use of these results within the framework of a simple yet realistic model to describe the entropic terms associated with the variety of amyloid conformations, a phase diagram can be calculated of the whole many--body system, leading to a thermodynamical picture in overall agreement with the experimental findings. In particular, the existence of micellar metastable states seem to be a key issue to determine the thermodynamical properties of the system."

        "Abstract": "We investigate, both numerically and experimentally, the usefulness of a distributed nonlinearity in a passive coherent photonic reservoir computer. This computing system is based on a passive coherent optical fiber-ring cavity in which part of the nonlinearities are realized by the Kerr nonlinearity. Linear coherent reservoirs can solve difficult tasks but are aided by nonlinear components in their input or output layer. Here, we compare the impact of nonlinear transformations of information in the reservoir input layer, its bulk - the fiber-ring cavity - and its readout layer. For the injection of data into the reservoir, we compare a linear input mapping to the nonlinear transfer function of a Mach Zehnder modulator. For the reservoir bulk, we quantify the impact of the optical Kerr effect. For the readout layer we compare a linear output to a quadratic output implemented by a photodiode. We find that optical nonlinearities in the reservoir itself, such as the optical Kerr nonlinearity studied in the present work, enhance the task solving capability of the reservoir. This suggests that such nonlinearities will play a key role in future coherent all-optical reservoir computers."

Therefore, the $t$-local domains (i.e., the local domains, with maximal ideal being a $t$-ideal) are \"cousins\" of valuation domains, but, as we will see in detail, not so close. Indeed, for instance, a localization of a $t$-local domain is not necessarily $t$-local, but of course a localization of a valuation domain is a valuation domain.   So it is natural to ask under what conditions is a $t$-local domain a valuation domain? The main purpose of the present paper is to address this question, surveying in part previous work by various authors containing useful properties for applying them to our goal."

        "Abstract": "We study polaron excitations induced by an impurity interacting with a two-dimensional $p+ip$ Fermi superfluid. As the Fermi-Fermi pairing interaction is tuned, the background Fermi superfluid undergoes a topological phase transition. We show that such a transition is accompanied by a discontinuity in the second derivative of the polaron energy, regardless of the impurity-fermion interaction. We also identify a polaron to trimer crossover when the Fermi superfluid is in the strongly interacting, thus topologically trivial, regime. However, the trimer state is metastable against the molecular state where the impurity binds a Bogoliubov quasiparticle from the Fermi superfluid. By comparing the polaron to molecule transition in our system with that of an impurity in a noninteracting Fermi sea, we find that pairing interactions in the background Fermi superfluid effectively facilitate the impurity-fermion binding. Our results suggest the possibility of using the impurity as a probe for detecting topological phase transitions in the background; they also reveal interesting competitions between various many-body states in the system."

If X is full and finite projective O_{X_A} is the C*-algebra C*(X), the generalization of the Cuntz-Krieger algebras introduced by Pimsner. More generally, C*(X) is canonically embedded in O_{X_A} as the C*-subalgebra generated by X. Conversely, if X is full, O_{X_A} is canonically embedded in the bidual of C*(X). Moreover, regarding X as an object A_X_A of the C*-category of Hilbert A-bimodules, we associate to it a C*-subalgebra O_{A_X_A} of O_{X_A} commuting with A, on which X induces a canonical endomorphism \\rho. We discuss conditions under which A and O_{A_X_A} are the relative commutant of each other and X is precisely the subspace of intertwiners in O_{X_A} between the identity and \\rho on O_{A_X_A}.

A driven quantum dot can deterministically excite low-energy collective modes of a nuclear spin ensemble in the presence of lattice strain. We propose to gate a quantum state transfer between this central electron and these low-energy excitations -- spin waves -- in the presence of a strong magnetic field, where the nuclear coherence time is long. We develop a microscopic theory capable of calculating the exact time evolution of the strained electron-nuclear system. With this, we evaluate the operation of quantum state storage and show that fidelities up to 90% can be reached with a modest nuclear polarisation of only 50%. These findings demonstrate that strain-enabled nuclear spin waves are a highly suitable candidate for quantum memory."

We first tested it on noisy synthetic spectra of A, F, G, and K-type stars, and inverted simultaneously their atmospheric fundamental parameters: Teff, log g, [M/H] and vsini. Different learning databases were calculated using a range of sampling in Teff, log g, vsini, and [M/H]. Combined with a principal component analysis (PCA) nearest neighbors (NN) search, the size of the learning database is reduced. A Tikhonov regularization is applied, given the ill-conditioning of SIR. For all spectral types, decreasing the size of the learning database allowed us to reach internal accuracies better than PCA-based NN-search using larger learning databases. For each analyzed parameter, we have reached internal errors that are smaller than the sampling step of the parameter. We have also applied the technique to a sample of observed FGK and A stars. For a selection of well studied stars, the inverted parameters are in agreement with the ones derived in previous studies. The RSIR inversion technique, complemented with PCA pre-processing proves to be efficient in estimating stellar parameters of A, F, G, and K stars."

The problem is split into two subproblems: (a) the scalar source identification, and (b) solution of the divergence equation. For subproblem (a), we design an algorithm for reconstructing the scalar source function, which does not require solving the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. Instead, the problem is reformulated as a linear operator equation, which is solved by a projection method. The dimension of the subspace, in which the source function is sought, is independent of the dimension of the forward problem, leading to reduction of the size of the inverse problem. Numerical experiments with exact and noisy data are presented. For subproblem (b), the divergence equation was posed as a minimization problem, which, by means of Lagrangian formalism, was reduced to a system of partial differential equation of Stokes type with a unique solution. To demonstrate how this framework can be used in a practical application, we implemented the algorithm in the two-dimensional physical space, using a finite-different discretization on staggered grids."

Considering the $x_i$ as jobs to be performed, an integer assignment satisfying $S$ schedules the jobs subject to the constraints of the atomic formulas. The scheduling counting function counts the number of solutions to $S$. We prove that this counting function is a polynomial in the number of time slots allowed. Scheduling polynomials include the chromatic polynomial of a graph, the zeta polynomial of a lattice, the Billera-Jia-Reiner polynomial of a matroid.   To any scheduling problem, we associate not only a counting function for solutions, but also a quasisymmetric function and a quasisymmetric function in non-commuting variables. These scheduling functions include the chromatic symmetric functions of Sagan, Gebhard, and Stanley, and a close variant of Ehrenborg's quasisymmetric function for posets.   Geometrically, we consider the space of all solutions to a given scheduling problem. We extend a result of Steingr\\'immson by proving that the $h$-vector of the space of solutions is given by a shift of the scheduling polynomial. Furthermore, under certain niceness conditions on the defining boolean function, we prove partitionability of the space of solutions and positivity of fundamental expansions of the scheduling quasisymmetric functions and of the $h$-vector of the scheduling polynomial."

        "Abstract": "GJ 1214 is a nearby M dwarf star that hosts a transiting super-Earth-size planet, making this system an excellent target for atmospheric studies. Most studies find that the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b is flat, which favors either a high mean molecular weight or cloudy/hazy hydrogen (H) rich atmosphere model. Photometry at short wavelengths (< 0.7 micron) and in the K-band can discriminate the most between these different atmosphere models for GJ 1214b, but current observations do not have sufficiently high precision. We present photometry of seven transits of GJ 1214b through a narrow K-band (2.141 micron) filter with the Wide Field Camera on the 3.8 m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. Our photometric precision is typically 1.7x10^-3 (for a single transit), comparable with other ground-based observations of GJ 1214b. We measure a planet-star radius ratio of 0.1158+/-0.0013, which, along with other studies, also supports a flat transmission spectrum for GJ 1214b. Since this does not exclude a scenario where GJ 1214b has a H-rich envelope with heavy elements that are sequestered below a cloud/haze layer, we compare K-band observations with models of H_2 collision-induced absorption in an atmosphere for a range of temperatures. While we find no evidence for deviation from a flat spectrum (slope s = 0.0016+/-0.0038), an H_2 dominated upper atmosphere (< 60 mbar) cannot be excluded. More precise observations at < 0.7 micron and in the K-band as well as a uniform analysis of all published data would be useful for establishing more robust limits on atmosphere models for GJ 1214b."

        "Abstract": "Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible amongst a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a ``selfish agent'', and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents to select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced.   Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m\\gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\\log\\log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\\log\\log m+n^4)$. We also give a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\max\\{\\log\\log m,n\\})$ for the convergence time."

Evolution of coordinate perturbations and the corresponding perturbations of lapse and shift can be described by a system of eight quasi-linear partial differential equations. Stability with respect to gauge perturbations depends on a choice of gauge and a background metric, but it does not depend on a particular form of a 3+1 system if its constrained solutions are equivalent to those of the Einstein equations. Stability of a number of known gauges is investigated in the limit of short-wavelength perturbations. All fixed gauges except a synchronous gauge are found to be ill-posed. A maximal slicing gauge and its parabolic extension are shown to be ill-posed as well. A necessary condition is derived for well-posedness of metric-dependent algebraic gauges. Well-posed metric-dependent gauges are found, however, to be generally unstable. Both instability and ill-posedness are associated with perturbations of physical accelerations of reference frames."

The most massive of the three stars, K2-giant HD 240237, has a 5.3 MJ minimum mass companion orbiting the star at a 746-day period. The K0-giant BD +48 738 is orbited by a > 0.91 MJ planet which has a period of 393 days and shows a non-linear, long-term radial velocity trend that indicates a presence of another, more distant companion, which may have a substellar mass or be a low-mass star. The K2-giant HD 96127, has a > 4.0 MJ mass companion in a 647-day orbit around the star. The two K2-giants exhibit a significant RV noise that complicates the detection of low-amplitude, periodic variations in the data. If the noise component of the observed RV variations is due to solar-type oscillations, we show, using all the published data for the substellar companions to giants, that its amplitude is anti-correlated with stellar metallicity."

        "Title": "Quantization of (2+1)-spinning particles and bifermionic constraint  problem",

There it was demonstrated that, by applying a consistent quantization scheme to a classical model of a spinless relativistic particle as well as to the Berezin-Marinov model of 3+1 Dirac particle, it is possible to obtain a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics of such particles. In the present article we apply a similar approach to the problem of quantizing the massive 2+1 Dirac particle. However, we stress that such a problem differs in a nontrivial way from the one in 3+1 dimensions. The point is that in 2+1 dimensions each spin polarization describes different fermion species. Technically this fact manifests itself through the presence of a bifermionic constant and of a bifermionic first-class constraint. In particular, this constraint does not admit a conjugate gauge condition at the classical level. The quantization problem in 2+1 dimensions is also interesting from the physical viewpoint (e.g. anyons). In order to quantize the model, we first derive a classical formulation in an effective phase space, restricted by constraints and gauges. Then the condition of preservation of the classical symmetries allows us to realize the operator algebra in an unambiguous way and construct an appropriate Hilbert space. The physical sector of the constructed quantum mechanics contains spin-1/2 particles and antiparticles without an infinite number of negative-energy levels, and exactly reproduces the one-particle sector of the 2+1 quantum theory of a spinor field."

We show that the grooming algorithm derived from the deep RL agent can match state-of-the-art techniques used at the Large Hadron Collider, resulting in improved mass resolution for boosted objects. Given a suitable reward function, the agent learns how to train a policy which optimally removes soft wide-angle radiation, allowing for a modular grooming technique that can be applied in a wide range of contexts.

        "Abstract": "This paper describes a general investigation of stationary oscillations of galaxies. It begins with a linear analysis of modes of oscillation with continuous spectra of real frequencies. Such modes are gravitational analogues of the van Kampen modes of oscillation in plasmas. The characteristic value problem governing modes of the van Kampen type in a galaxy is solved with the aid of a modified version of the matrix method of Kalnajs in which the perturbation of the distribution function is expressed in terms of generalized functions. In general, there is no characteristic equation governing the frequencies in the continuous spectrum. However, isolated frequencies in the continuous spectrum do satisfy a characteristic equation which, for stellar systems, is a counterpart of the dispersion relation proposed by Vlasov for plasma oscillations. The linear analysis also provides a characteristic equation for modes with a discrete spectrum of real and/or complex frequencies. The second part of the paper describes a perturbation theory for a stationary oscillation of a galaxy with a small but finite amplitude. Integrals of the stellar motion are constructed with the aid of canonical perturbation theory and used in conjunction with the theorem of Jeans in order to specify the density of stars in the six-dimensional phase space. These oscillations are slightly nonlinear counterparts of the modes of the van Kampen type, and they are stellar-dynamical counterparts of the nonlinear plasma waves described by Bernstein, Greene, and Kruskal. Fully nonlinear models of stationary oscillations of galaxies can be constructed with the aid of Schwarzschild's numerical method for the solution of the fundamental integral equation describing the self-consistency of a stellar system."

        "Abstract": "A constitutive model is developed for the mechanical response of elastomers at finite strains. A polymer is treated as a network of linear chains linked by permanent (chemical crosslinks) and temporary (entanglements and van der Waals forces) junctions. Temporary junctions are assumed to be in two states: loose (passive) when they impose only topological constrains on available configurations of chains, and tight (active) when their effect is tantamount to that for crosslinks. Stretching of a specimen implies that some loose junctions become active, which decreases the average length of a chain.   A long chain is treated as an ensemble of inextensible strands connected in sequel. Two neighboring strands are bridged by a bond which may be in two conformations: flexed (trans) and extended (cis). A bond in the flexed conformation is modeled as a linear elastic solid, whereas the mechanical energy of a bond in the extended conformation (two rigid rods directed along a straight line) is disregarded. For a virgin specimen, all bonds are in the flexed conformation. Under loading some bonds are transformed from flexed to extended conformation.   Stress-strain relations for a rubbery polymer and kinetic equations for the trans-cis transition are derived using the laws of thermodynamics. Governing equations are determined by 5 adjustable parameters which are found by fitting experimental data in uniaxial tensile tests on natural rubber vulcanizates with various amounts of crosslinks. Fair agreement is demonstrated between results of numerical simulation and observations with the elongation ratio up to $k=8$. We analyze the effects of cyclic loading, thermal annealing and recovery by swelling on the material constants."

In the radiation-dominated Universe, it was suggested that there are two solutions for the cosmic scale factor a(t) : the standard solution $a\\sim t^{1/2}$, and a solution $a\\sim t^{1/4}$, which is incompatible with standard big bang nucleosynthesis. In this note, we reconsider expansion of the Universe in this scenario. We derive and solve a first order, linear differential equation for H^2, the square of the expansion rate of the Universe, as a function of a. The differences between our equation for H^2 and the relationship found in standard cosmology are (i) there is a term proportional to density squared (a fact already known), which is small when the density is small compared to the brane tension, and (ii) there is a contribution which acts like a relativistic fluid. We show that this second contribution is due to gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk. Thus, we find that there need not be any conflict between cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario and the standard model of cosmology. We discuss how reheating at the end of inflation leads to the correct relationship between matter density and expansion rate, $H^2\\to 8\\pi G\\rho_m/3$, and the conditions that must be met for the expansion rate of the Universe to be close to its standard model value around the epoch of cosmological nucleosynthesis."

Bulk Comptonization of disc photons is shown to yield a spectral component contributing in the far UV band, and would then be currently unobservable. On the contrary, the bulk Comptonization of broad line photons may yield a significant feature in the soft X-ray band. Such a feature is time-dependent and transient, and dominates over the non thermal continuum only when: a) the dissipation occurs close to, but within, the broad line region; b) other competing processes, like the synchrotron self-Compton emission, yield a negligible flux in the X-ray band. The presence of a bulk Compton component may account for the X-ray properties of high redshift blazars that show a flattening (and possibly a hump) in the soft X-rays, previously interpreted as due to intrinsic absorption. We discuss why the conditions leading to a detectable bulk Compton feature might be met only occasionally in high redshift blazars, concluding that the absence of such a feature in the spectra of most blazars should not be taken as evidence against matter--dominated relativistic jets. The detection of such a component carries key information on the bulk Lorentz factor and kinetic energy associated to (cold) leptons."

The basis is the theory of semigroups of linear operators mapping a Banach space $X$ into itself. The rates of approximation play a basic role.   Another tool is a Drazin-like inverse operator $B$ for the infinitesimal generator $A$ of a semigroup that arises naturally in ergodic theory. This operator $B$ is a closed, not necessarily bounded, operator. It was introduced in a paper with U. Westphal (1970/71) and extended to a generalized setting with J. J. Koliha (2009).   The novel open problem concerns the third or Robin's problem of potential theory, the solution of which is not a semigroup of operators. Hence, the semigroup methods applied to Dirichlet's or Neumann's problem cannot be applied. The authors give several hints how to overcome these difficulties."

This equation is the standard linearized conjugacy equation for germs of holomorphic maps in a neighborhood of a fixed point. The parameter is the eigenvalue $q$ of the linear part. This problem has been first investigated by Arnol'd and Herman. Herman raised the question whether the solutions of the cohomological equation had a quasianalytic dependence on the parameter. Indeed they are analytic outside $\\S^1$ which is a natural boundary but the solutions are still defined at points of $\\S^1$ which lie ``far enough from resonances''. We adapt to our case Herman's construction of an increasing sequence of compacts which avoid resonances and prove that the solutions belong to the associated space of monogenic functions. The solutions admit asymptotic expansions at the points of $\\S^1$ which satisfy some arithmetical condition, and Carleman's Theorem allows us to answer negatively to the question of quasianalyticity at these points. But resonances (roots of unity) lead to asymptotic expansions, for which quasianalyticity is obtained as a particular case of \\'Ecalle's theory of resurgent functions. At constant-type points one can still recover the solutions from their asymptotic expansions and obtain a special kind of quasianalyticity. Our results are obtained by reducing the problem to the study of a fundamental solution (which is the ``quantum logarithm''). We deduce as a corollary of our work the proof of a conjecture of Gammel on the monogenic and quasianalytic properties of a certain number-theoretical Borel-Wolff-Denjoy series."

Modeling of the H2O spectra using a homogeneous model with a constant excitation temperature T_ex shows that the H2O abundances increase with temperature, up to a few times 10^-5 with respect to H2 for the hottest sources (T_ex ~500 K). This is still a factor of 10 lower than the H2O ice abundances observed toward cold sources in which evaporation is not significant (Keane et al. 2001). Gas-phase CO2 is not abundant in our sources. The abundances are nearly constant for T_ex>~100 K at a value of a few times 10^-7, much lower than the solid-state abundances of ~1--3 times 10^-6 (Gerakines et al. 1999). For both H2O and CO2 the gas/solid ratio increases with temperature, but the increase is much stronger for H2O than for CO2, suggesting a different type of chemistry. In addition to the homogeneous models, a power law model has been developed for one of our sources, based on the physical structure of this region as determined from submillimeter data by van der Tak et al. (1999). The resulting H2O model spectrum gives a good fit to the data."

        "Abstract": "The Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations, which describes classical plasma physics, is extremely challenging to solve, even by numerical simulation on powerful computers. By linearizing and assuming a Maxwellian background distribution function, we convert the Vlasov-Maxwell system into a Hamiltonian simulation problem. Then for the limiting case of electrostatic Landau damping, we design and verify a quantum algorithm, appropriate for a future error-corrected universal quantum computer. While the classical simulation has costs that scale as $\\mathcal{O}(N_v T)$ for a velocity grid with $N_v$ grid points and simulation time $T$, our quantum algorithm scales as $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{polylog}(N_v) T/\\delta)$ where $\\delta$ is the measurement error, and weaker scalings have been dropped. Extensions, including electromagnetics and higher dimensions, are discussed. A quantum computer could efficiently handle a high resolution, six-dimensional phase space grid, but the $1/\\delta$ cost factor to extract an accurate result remains a difficulty. This work provides insight into the possibility of someday achieving efficient plasma simulation on a quantum computer."

Our method works for the same reason that scene completion works: the spatial structure of objects is simple. But we offer a much higher resolution representation of space than current scene completion methods, as we operate at pixel-level precision and do not rely on a voxel representation. Furthermore, we do not require RGBD inputs. Our method uses a standard encoder-decoder architecture, and with a decoder modified to accept an object mask. We describe a small evaluation dataset that we have collected, which allows inference about what factors affect reconstruction most strongly. Using this dataset, we show that our depth predictions for masked objects are better than other baselines."

        "Abstract": "This paper is concerned with the weak-moment magnetism in heavy-fermion materials and its relation to the non-Fermi liquid physics observed near the transition to the Fermi liquid. We explore the hypothesis that the primary fluctuations responsible for the non-Fermi liquid physics are those associated with the destruction of the large Fermi surface of the Fermi liquid. Magnetism is suggested to be a low-energy instability of the resulting small Fermi surface state. A concrete realization of this picture is provided by a fractionalized Fermi liquid state which has a small Fermi surface of conduction electrons, but also has other exotic excitations with interactions described by a gauge theory in its deconfined phase. Of particular interest is a three-dimensional fractionalized Fermi liquid with a spinon Fermi surface and a U(1) gauge structure. A direct second-order transition from this state to the conventional Fermi liquid is possible and involves a jump in the electron Fermi surface volume. The critical point displays non-Fermi liquid behavior. A magnetic phase may develop from a spin density wave instability of the spinon Fermi surface. This exotic magnetic metal may have a weak ordered moment although the local moments do not participate in the Fermi surface. Experimental signatures of this phase and implications for heavy-fermion systems are discussed."

The data are well described by comptonization models (CompTT and BMC) in which seed photons with temperatures between 1.1 kev and 1.5 kev are comptonized by a hot plasma at 50 kev thereby producing a hard tail which extends up to, at least, 100 kev. We offer a new method of identification of neutron star systems using a temperature - luminosity relation. If a given X-ray source is characterized by a low bolometric luminosity and a relatively high color blackbody temperature (>1 kev) it has necessarily to be a neutron star rather than a black hole. From these arguments it is shown that the area of the soft photon source must be small (r ~ 1 km) and that the accretion disk, if present, must be truncated very far from the compact object. Here we report on the possible existence of a cyclotron line around 30 kev. The presence of a neutron star in the system is strongly favored by the available data."

        "Abstract": "We have examined the role of the BCS pairing mechanism in the formation of the magnetic moment and henceforth a spin glass (SG) phase by studying a fermionic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a local BCS coupling between the fermions. This model is obtained by using perturbation theory to trace out the conduction electrons degrees of freedom in conventional superconducting alloys. The model is formulated in the path integral formalism where the spin operators are represented by bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields and it reduces to a single site problem that can be solved within the static approximation with a replica symmetric Ansatz. We argue that this is a valid procedure for values of temperature above the de Almeida-Thouless instability line. The phase diagram in the T-g plane, where g is the strength of the pairing interaction, for fixed variance J^2/N of the random couplings J_{ij}, exhibits three regions: a normal paramagnetic (NP) phase, a spin glass (SG) phase and a pairing (PAIR) phase where there is formation of local pairs.The NP and PAIR phases are separated by a second order transition line g=g_{c}(T) that ends at a tricritical point T_{3}=0.9807J, g_{3}=5,8843J, from where it becomes a first order transition line that meets the line of second order transitions at T_{c}=0.9570J that separates the NP and the SG phases. For T<T_{c} the SG phase is separated from the PAIR phase by a line of first order transitions.   These results agree qualitatively with experimental data in Gd_{x}Th_{1-x}RU_{2}."

The general conditions for gauging a non-linear sigma model with a set of involutive vector fields are given. We show that it is always possible to find a set of vector fields which will (locally) admit a Lie algebroid gauging. Furthermore, the gauging process is not unique; if the vector fields span the tangent space of the manifold, there is a free choice of a flat connection. Ensuring that the gauged action is equivalent to the ungauged action imposes the real constraint of the Lie algebroid gauging proposal. It does not appear possible (in general) to find a field strength term which can be added to the action via a Lagrange multiplier to impose the equivalence of the gauged and ungauged actions. This prevents the proposal from being used to extend T-duality. Integrability of local Lie algebroid actions to global Lie groupoid actions is discussed."

We analyze the local and global obstructions and give a complete solution to the problem for regular maps. We establish that these can always be smoothly diagonalized locally and that the obstructions to doing this globally are non-trivial Weyl group and torus bundles on $M$. We show how the patching of local diagonalizing maps gives rise to non-trivial $T$-bundles, explain the relation to winding numbers of maps into $G/T$ and restrictions of the structure group and examine the behaviour of gauge fields under this diagonalization. We also discuss the complications that arise for non-regular maps and in the presence of non-trivial $G$-bundles. In particular, we establish a relation between the existence of regular sections of a non-trivial adjoint bundle and restrictions of the structure group of a principal $G$-bundle to $T$. We use these results to justify a Weyl integral formula for functional integrals which, as a novel feature not seen in the finite-dimensional case, contains a summation over all those topological $T$-sectors which arise as restrictions of a trivial principal $G$ bundle and which was used previously to solve completely Yang-Mills theory and the $G/G$ model in two dimensions."

Clustering is a technique to reduce the number of comparison needed to find similar pairs in a set of $n$ elements such as protein sequences. Precise clustering ensures that each pair of similar elements appears together in at least one cluster, so that similarities can be identified by all-to-all comparison in each cluster rather than on the full set. This paper introduces ClusterMerge, a new algorithm for precise clustering that uses transitive relationships among the elements to enable parallel and scalable implementations of this approach. We apply ClusterMerge to the important problem of finding similar amino acid sequences in a collection of proteins. ClusterMerge identifies 99.8% of similar pairs found by a full $O(n^2)$ comparison, with only half as many operations. More importantly, ClusterMerge is highly amenable to parallel and distributed computation. Our implementation achieves a speedup of 604$\\times$ on 768 cores (1400$\\times$ faster than a comparable single-threaded clustering implementation), a strong scaling efficiency of 90%, and a weak scaling efficiency of nearly 100%."

In particular, the optimal Skorokhod embedding problem over $\\mathcal{T}(\\nu)$ has the same value as the relaxed one over $\\mathcal{R}(\\nu)$ when the reward function is semicontinuous, which parallels a fundamental result about Monge maps and Kantorovich couplings in optimal transport.

While existence of a dual solution failed in previous formulations, we introduce a relaxation of the dual problem and establish existence of solutions as well as absence of a duality gap, even for irregular reward functions. This leads to a monotonicity principle which complements the key theorem of Beiglb\\\"ock, Cox and Huesmann [Optimal transport and Skorokhod embedding, Invent. Math., 208:327-400, 2017].

        "Abstract": "We present a deep X-ray observation of the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in NGC4258 (M106) using ASCA. The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

The latter of these two concepts is studied in particular form with a general optical multiport device, consisting of an arbitrary array of beam-splitters and phase-shifters. I show how such an apparatus generalizes the original projection synthesis technique, introduced as an in principle technique to measure the canonical phase distribution. Just as for the original projection synthesis, it is found that such a generalised device can synthesize any general projection onto a state in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. One of the important findings of this thesis is that, unlike the original projection synthesis technique, the general apparatus described here only requires a classical, that is a coherent, reference field at the input of the device. Such an apparatus lends itself much more readily to practical implementation and would find applications in measurement and predictive state engineering.   If we relax the above condition to allow for just a single non-classical reference field, we show that the apparatus is capable of producing a single-shot measure of canonical phase. That is, the apparatus can project onto any one of an arbitrarily large subset of phase eigenstates, with a probability proportional to the overlap of the phase state and the input field. Unlike the original projection synthesis proposal, this proposal requires a binomial reference state as opposed to a reciprocal binomial state. We find that such a reference state can be obtained, to an excellent approximation, from a suitably squeezed state.   The analysis of these measurement apparatuses is performed in the less usual, but completely rigorous, retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics."

We show that this parameter space can be represented by fewer variables, namely the \\emph{orbit invariants} obtained by exploiting texture symmetry. Next we show how a class of locally countable texture statistics, the Minkowski functionals -- recently shown to be a proxy for human performance in texture discrimination tasks - can be written as a linear combination of the dihedral orbit invariants. Furthermore, by recasting these functionals as a combination of dihedral invariants, a generalization of these functionals can be obtained for textures of any number of grey-levels, patch sizes, or lattice types -- greatly reducing the number of dimensions/parameters needed to characterize the generated images. Orbit invariants may therefore provide a clue on the discrimination of these richer textures, as the ordinary Minkowski functionals do for binary textures."

The key analytical tool is the singular value expansion of the parameterized solution, which we approximate with a singular value decomposition of a parameter snapshot matrix.

We employ a novel method to select this subset that uses the parameter gradient of the right singular vectors to split the terms in the expansion yielding a mean prediction and a prediction covariance---similar to a Gaussian process approximation. The covariance serves as a confidence measure for the reduce order model. We demonstrate the efficacy of the reduced-order model using a parameter study of heat transfer in random media. The high-fidelity simulations produce more than 4TB of data; we compute the singular value decomposition and evaluate the reduced-order model using scalable MapReduce/Hadoop implementations.

The procedure consists in gluing together some building blocks, called hyperbolic plugs, along their boundary in order to obtain a closed 3-manifold endowed with a complete flow. The main theorem of [5] states that (under some mild hypotheses) it is possible to choose the gluing maps so the resulting flow is Anosov. The aim of the present paper is to show a uniqueness result for Anosov flows obtained by such a procedure. Roughly speaking, we show that the orbital equivalence class of these Anosov flows is insensitive to the precise choice of the gluing maps used in the construction. The proof relies on a coding procedure which we find interesting for its own sake, and follows a strategy that was introduced by T. Barbot in a particular case."

This is a powerful new tool for analyzing the results of an OGTT test,and the question arises as to whether the test itself can be improved. It is of particular interest to discover whether the times at which a patient's glucose is measured can be changed to improve the effectiveness of the test. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of finding a better experimental design, that is, a set of times to perform the test. We review the theory of Bayesian experimental design and propose an estimator for the expected utility of a design. We then study the properties of this estimator and propose a new method for quantifying the uncertainty in comparisons between designs. We implement this method to find a new design and the proposed design is compared favorably to the usual testing scheme."

        "Abstract": "In 1996, Strominger, Yau and Zaslow made a conjecture about the geometric relationship between two mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds. Roughly put, if X and Y are a mirror pair of such manifolds, then X should possess a special Lagrangian torus fibration $f:X\\to B$ such that Y is obtained by dualizing the fibration f. This leaves a huge amount to be done to verify such conjectures. This paper takes a speculative point of view, in that it assumes that a special Lagrangian torus fibration exists on X. We address a number of questions of a topological nature: what is the relationship between the cohomology of X and the cohomology of the dual fibration? what kind of information does the Leray spectral sequence for f contain? what is the relationship between the topological (1,1) couplings of the dual of f and the (1,n-1)-couplings of X in the large complex structure limit? These questions are shown to have nice answers if a key conjecture about the monodromy diffeomorphisms about a large complex structure limit point holds. Roughly put, this conjecture says that monodromy about a large complex structure limit point can be described as a very natural generalization of a Dehn twist for an elliptic curve. Given this conjecture, we show, among other results, that the large complex radius limit of the (1,n-1) couplings on X coincide with the topological (1,1) couplings on Y, and if dim X=3, the Leray filtration and weight filtrations of the mixed Hodge structure coincide, as conjectured by myself and P.M.H.

According to Kohn's theorem, the frequency of this collective mode is not affected by an interaction between the atoms and is always equal to the trap frequency.

We explicitly prove that the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA), including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels, is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory developed by Nozi\\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\\it depend} on the strength of effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance."

        "Title": "Spatiotemporal Stacked Sequential Learning for Pedestrian Detection",
        "Abstract": "Pedestrian classifiers decide which image windows contain a pedestrian. In practice, such classifiers provide a relatively high response at neighbor windows overlapping a pedestrian, while the responses around potential false positives are expected to be lower. An analogous reasoning applies for image sequences. If there is a pedestrian located within a frame, the same pedestrian is expected to appear close to the same location in neighbor frames. Therefore, such a location has chances of receiving high classification scores during several frames, while false positives are expected to be more spurious. In this paper we propose to exploit such correlations for improving the accuracy of base pedestrian classifiers. In particular, we propose to use two-stage classifiers which not only rely on the image descriptors required by the base classifiers but also on the response of such base classifiers in a given spatiotemporal neighborhood. More specifically, we train pedestrian classifiers using a stacked sequential learning (SSL) paradigm. We use a new pedestrian dataset we have acquired from a car to evaluate our proposal at different frame rates. We also test on a well known dataset: Caltech. The obtained results show that our SSL proposal boosts detection accuracy significantly with a minimal impact on the computational cost. Interestingly, SSL improves more the accuracy at the most dangerous situations, i.e. when a pedestrian is close to the camera."

        "Abstract": "We follow up an earlier work (briefly reviewed below) to investigate the temporal stability of an exact travelling front solution, constructed in the form of an integral expression, for a one-dimensional discrete Nagumo-like model without recovery. Since the model is a piecewise linear one with an on-site reaction function involving a Heaviside step function, a straightforward linearisation around the front solution presents problems, and we follow an alternative approach in estimating a `stability multiplier' by looking at the variational problem as a succession of linear evolution of the perturbations, punctuated with `kicks' of small but finite duration. The perturbations get damped during the linear evolution, while the kicks amplify only the perturbations located at specific sites (the `significant perturbations', see below) with reference to the propagating front. Comparison is made with results of numerical integration of the reaction-diffusion system whereby it appears likely that the travelling front is temporally stable for all parameter values characterising the model for which it exists. We modify the system by introducing a slow variation of a relevant recovery parameter and perform a leading order singular perturbation analysis to construct a pulse solution in the resulting model. In addition, we obtain (in the leading order) a 1-parameter family of periodic pulse trains for the system, modelling re-entrant pulses in a one-dimensional ring of excitable cells."

        "Abstract": "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of green and sustainable projects has been found to be a necessary analysis in order to include all upstream, downstream, and indirect impacts. Because of the complexity of interactions, the differential impacts with respect to a baseline, i.e., a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, are commonly considered to relatively compare various projects. However, as the degree of penetration of a project in the baseline increases, the popular marginal assumption does no longer hold, and the differential impacts may become inconsistent. Although various mythologies have been successfully proposed and used to contain such a side effect, the bottom-up nature, which initiates the assessment from the project itself and ultimately widens the scope, could easily fail to acknowledge critical modifications to the baseline. This is highly relevant in terms of ICT's disruptive and dynamic technologies which push the baseline to become a marginal legacy. In this work, an analytic formalism is presented to provide a means of comparison of such technologies and projects. The core idea behind the proposed methodology is a magnitude-insensitive graph-based distance function to differentially compare a project with a baseline. The applicability of the proposed methodology is then evaluated in a use case of OTT/IPTV online media distribution services."

Efficient resource utilization is an important design aspect in such processors. Depending on the workload, mis-speculated execution can severely impact resource utilization and power utilization. In general, compared to a uniprocessor, a multithreaded processor may have better tolerance towards mis-speculation. However there can still be phases where even a multi-threaded processor performance may get impacted by branch induced mis-speculation. In this paper I propose monitoring the branch predictor behavior of various hardware threads running on the multi-threaded processor and use that information as a feedback to the thread arbiter/picker which schedules the next thread to fetch instructions from. If I find that a particular thread is going through a phase where it is consistently mis-predicting its branches and its average branch misprediction stall is above a specific threshold then I temporarily reduce the priority for picking that thread. I do a qualitative comparison of various solutions to the problem of resource inefficiency caused due to mis-speculated branches in multithreaded processors.

In this paper, we present a physics based analytical model that uses a modified Simmons' tunneling expression to capture the spin dependent tunneling in a magnetic tunnel junction(MTJ). Coupled with an analytical derivation of the critical switching current based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, and the write error rate derived from a solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, this model provides us a quick estimate of the energydelay- reliability tradeoffs in perpendicular STTRAMs due to thermal fluctuations. In other words, the model provides a simple way to calculate the energy consumed during a write operation that ensures a certain error rate and delay time, while being numerically far less intensive than a full-fledged stochastic calculation. We calculate the worst case energy consumption during anti-parallel (AP) to parallel (P) and P to AP switchings and quantify how increasing the anisotropy field HK and lowering the saturation magnetization MS, can significantly reduce the energy consumption. A case study on how manufacturing variations of the MTJ cell can affect the energy consumption and delay is also reported."

Moreover, under appropriate hypotheses, we establish corresponding lower bounds which imply the existence of an infinite number of resonances, or the absence of resonances in certain sectors adjoining $2bq$. Finally, we deduce a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair $(H,H_0)$ as a sum of a harmonic measure related to the resonances, and the imaginary part of a holomorphic function. This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner approximation, implies a trace formula, and provides information on the singularities of the SSF at the Landau levels."

In a canonical formulation the morphology and scaling behavior are accessed by mean of a principle of least action in the asymptotic non-perturbative weak noise limit. The ensuing coupled saddle point field equations for the local slope and noise fields, replacing the noisy Burgers equation, are solved yielding nonlinear localized soliton solutions and extended linear diffusive mode solutions, describing the morphology of a growing interface. The canonical formalism and the principle of least action also associate momentum, energy, and action with a soliton-diffusive mode configuration and thus provides a selection criterion for the noise-induced fluctuations. In a ``quantum mechanical'' representation of the path integral the noise fluctuations, corresponding to different paths in the path integral, are interpreted as ``quantum fluctuations'' and the growth morphology represented by a Landau-type quasi-particle gas of ``quantum solitons'' with gapless dispersion and ``quantum diffusive modes'' with a gap in the spectrum. Finally, the scaling properties are dicussed from a heuristic point of view in terms of a``quantum spectral representation'' for the slope correlations. The dynamic eponent z=3/2 is given by the gapless soliton dispersion law, whereas the roughness exponent zeta =1/2 follows from a regularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation. A heuristic expression for the scaling function is given by spectral representation and has a form similar to the probability distribution for Levy flights with index $z$."

        "Abstract": "Sensitive and fast force measurements are performed on sheared granular layers undergoing stick-slip motion, along with simultaneous imaging. A full study has been done for spherical particles with a +-20% size distribution. Stick-slip motion due to repetitive fluidization of the layer occurs for low driving velocities. Between major slip events, slight creep occurs that is variable from one event to the next. The effects of changing the stiffness k and velocity V of the driving system are studied in detail. The stick-slip motion is almost periodic for spherical particles over a wide range of parameters, but becomes irregular when k is large and V is relatively small. At larger V, the motion becomes smoother and is affected by the inertia of the upper plate bounding the layer. Measurements of the period T and amplitude A of the relative motion are presented as a function of V. At a critical value Vc, a transition to continuous sliding motion occurs that is discontinuous for k not too large. The time dependence of the instantaneous velocity of the upper plate and the frictional force produced by the granular layer are determined within individual slipping events. The force is a multi-valued function of the instantaneous velocity, with pronounced hysteresis and a sudden drop prior to resticking. Measurements of vertical displacement reveal a small dilation of the material (about one tenth of the mean particle size in a layer 20 particles deep) associated with each slip event. Finally, optical imaging reveals that localized microscopic rearrangements precede (and follow) each slip event. The behavior of smooth particles is contrasted with that of rough particles."

We first generalize a non-linear optimization problem from Filar and Vrieze [2004] to a $N$-player setting and break down this problem into simpler sub-problems that ensure there is no Bellman error for a given state and an agent. We then provide a characterization of solution points of these sub-problems that correspond to Nash equilibria of the underlying game and for this purpose, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient SG-SP (Stochastic Game - Sub-Problem) conditions. Using these conditions, we develop two actor-critic algorithms: OFF-SGSP (model-based) and ON-SGSP (model-free). Both algorithms use a critic that estimates the value function for a fixed policy and an actor that performs descent in the policy space using a descent direction that avoids local minima. We establish that both algorithms converge, in self-play, to the equilibria of a certain ordinary differential equation (ODE), whose stable limit points coincide with stationary NE of the underlying general-sum stochastic game. On a single state non-generic game (see Hart and Mas-Colell [2005]) as well as on a synthetic two-player game setup with $810,000$ states, we establish that ON-SGSP consistently outperforms NashQ ([Hu and Wellman, 2003] and FFQ [Littman, 2001] algorithms."

If a quartic self-interaction term for the scalar field is considered, there is a solution describing an asymptotically locally AdS charged black hole dressed with a scalar field that is regular on and outside the event horizon, which is a surface of negative constant curvature. This black hole can have negative mass, which is bounded from below for the extremal case, and its causal structure shows that the solution describes a \"black hole inside a black hole\". The thermodynamics of the non-extremal black hole is analyzed in the grand canonical ensemble. The entropy does not follow the area, and there is an effective Newton constant which depends on the value of the scalar field at the horizon. If the base manifold is locally flat, the solution has no electric charge, and the scalar field has a vanishing stress-energy tensor so that it dresses a locally AdS spacetime with a nut at the origin. In the case of vanishing selfinteraction, the solutions also dress locally AdS spacetimes, and if the base manifold is of negative constant curvature a massless electrically charged hairy black hole is obtained. The thermodynamics of this black hole is also analyzed. It is found that the bounds for the black holes parameters in the conformal frame obtained from requiring the entropy to be positive are mapped into the ones that guarantee cosmic censorship in the Einstein frame."

Two types of bottleneck features are described, obtained by applying a deep autoencoder to the output of an auditory model or a short-term autocorrelation analysis. We investigate two architectures for snore sound detection: a tandem system and a hybrid system. In both cases, a `language model' (LM) was incorporated to exploit information about the sequence of different SDB events. Our results show that the proposed bottleneck features give better performance than conventional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and that the tandem system outperforms the hybrid system given the limited amount of labelled training data available.

We do not find a significant correlation between SFR and the observed instantaneous $L_X$ for star forming AGN host galaxies. However, there is a weak but significant correlation between the mean $L_\\mathrm{X}$ and SFR of detected AGN in star forming galaxies, which likely reflects that $L_\\mathrm{X}$ varies on shorter timescales than SFR. We find no correlation between stellar mass and $L_\\mathrm{X}$ within the AGN population. Within both populations of star forming and quiescent galaxies, we find a similar power-law distribution in the probability of hosting an AGN as a function of specific accretion rate. Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, we find a star forming galaxy $\\sim2-3$ more likely than a quiescent galaxy to host an AGN of a given specific accretion rate. The probability of a galaxy hosting an AGN is constant across the main sequence of star formation. These results indicate that there is an underlying connection between star formation and the presence of AGN, but AGN are often hosted by quiescent galaxies."

Using this extension method, graphs with PSD throttling number at most $t$ are characterized as specific minors of the Cartesian product of complete graphs and trees. A similar characterization is obtained for the minor monotone floor of PSD zero forcing. Finally, the set of connected graphs on $n$ vertices with throttling number at least $n-k$ is characterized by forbidding a finite family of induced subgraphs.

In the framework of this conception any geometry is obtained as a result of the proper Euclidean geometry deformation. In the framework of this conception it is possible such a space-time geometry, where the free particle motion appears to be stochastic, although the geometry in itself remains to be deterministic. The stochasticity intensity depends on the particle mass. It is small for particle of a large mass, and it is essential for the particle of a small mass.

        "Title": "A causal statistical family of dissipative divergence type fluids",
        "Abstract": "In this paper we investigate some properties, including causality, of a particular class of relativistic dissipative fluid theories of divergence type. This set is defined as those theories coming from a statistical description of matter, in the sense that the three tensor fields appearing in the theory can be expressed as the three first momenta of a suitable distribution function. In this set of theories the causality condition for the resulting system of hyperbolic partial differential equations is very simple and allow to identify a subclass of manifestly causal theories, which are so for all states outside equilibrium for which the theory preserves this statistical interpretation condition. This subclass includes the usual equilibrium distributions, namely Boltzmann, Bose or Fermi distributions, according to the statistics used, suitably generalized outside equilibrium. Therefore this gives a simple proof that they are causal in a neighborhood of equilibrium. We also find a bigger set of dissipative divergence type theories which are only pseudo-statistical, in the sense that the third rank tensor of the fluid theory has the symmetry and trace properties of a third momentum of an statistical distribution, but the energy-momentum tensor, while having the form of a second momentum distribution, it is so for a different distribution function. This set also contains a subclass (including the one already mentioned) of manifestly causal theories."

        "Abstract": "The data required for heterotic string theory with gauge group G, which for anomaly cancellation reasons must either be E8 x E8 or Spin(32)/Z2, consist of the following: a ten-dimensional space-time X and a principal G-bundle P. The fields in the theory consist of: a metric on X, a connection on P and a B-field which is, roughly speaking, a two-form on X. As in a gauge theory, these fields are considered up to gauge equivalence. This means that the connection is considered up to bundle isomorphism, that the metric is considered up to diffeomorphism equivalence, and that the two-form B is considered up to equivalence by adding exact two-forms. The fact that B has a gauge invariance implies that it is not in fact a globally defined two-form but rather must be given as a gerbe-like object. The purpose of this paper is to give a precise definition of the mathematical nature of the B-field following the recent work of Freed and then to work out a description of the moduli space of 8-dimensional Euclidean invariant classical solutions to the string Equations of Motion in the case when space-time is compactified along a two-torus."

        "Title": "Stationarity preserving schemes for multi-dimensional linear systems",
        "Abstract": "There is a qualitative difference between one-dimensional and multi-dimensional solutions to the Euler equations: new features that arise are vorticity and a nontrivial incompressible (low Mach number) limit. They present challenges to finite volume methods. It seems that an important step in this direction is to first study the new features for the multi-dimensional acoustic equations. There exists an analogue of the low Mach number limit for this system and its vorticity is stationary.   It is shown that a scheme that possesses a stationary discrete vorticity (vorticity preserving) also has stationary states that are discretizations of all the analytic stationary states. This property is termed stationarity preserving. Both these features are not generically fulfilled by finite volume schemes; in this paper a condition is derived that determines whether a scheme is stationarity preserving (or, equivalently, vorticity preserving) on a Cartesian grid.   Additionally, this paper also uncovers a previously unknown connection to schemes that comply with the low Mach number limit. Truly multi-dimensional schemes are found to arise naturally and it is shown that a multi-dimensional discrete divergence previously discussed in the literature is the only possible stationarity preserving one (in a certain class)."

        "Title": "Quantum Time Uncertainty in a Gravity's Rainbow Formalism",
        "Abstract": "The existence of a minimum time uncertainty is usually argued to be a consequence of the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Most of the studies that point to this result are nonetheless based on perturbative quantization approaches, in which the effect of matter on the geometry is regarded as a correction to a classical background. In this paper, we consider rainbow spacetimes constructed from doubly special relativity by using a modification of the proposals of Magueijo and Smolin. In these models, gravitational effects are incorporated (at least to a certain extent) in the definition of the energy-momentum of particles without adhering to a perturbative treatment of the back reaction. In this context, we derive and compare the expressions of the time uncertainty in quantizations that use as evolution parameter either the background or the rainbow time coordinates. These two possibilities can be regarded as corresponding to perturbative and non-perturbative quantization schemes, respectively. We show that, while a non-vanishing time uncertainty is generically unavoidable in a perturbative framework, an infinite time resolution can in fact be achieved in a non-perturbative quantization for the whole family of doubly special relativity theories with unbounded physical energy."

Modeling of the H2O spectra using a homogeneous model with a constant excitation temperature T_ex shows that the H2O abundances increase with temperature, up to a few times 10^-5 with respect to H2 for the hottest sources (T_ex ~500 K). This is still a factor of 10 lower than the H2O ice abundances observed toward cold sources in which evaporation is not significant (Keane et al. 2001). Gas-phase CO2 is not abundant in our sources. The abundances are nearly constant for T_ex>~100 K at a value of a few times 10^-7, much lower than the solid-state abundances of ~1--3 times 10^-6 (Gerakines et al. 1999). For both H2O and CO2 the gas/solid ratio increases with temperature, but the increase is much stronger for H2O than for CO2, suggesting a different type of chemistry. In addition to the homogeneous models, a power law model has been developed for one of our sources, based on the physical structure of this region as determined from submillimeter data by van der Tak et al. (1999). The resulting H2O model spectrum gives a good fit to the data."

The rst case corresponds to add a noise term to a given equation using the framework of It\\^o or Stratonovich stochastic dierential equations. The second case corresponds to consider a parameters dependent dierential equations and to add a stochastic dynamics on the parameters using the framework of random ordinary dierential equations. Our main concerns for the preservation of properties is stability/instability of equilibrium points and symplectic/Poisson Hamiltonian structures. We formulate persistence theorem in these two cases and prove that the cases of external and internal stochastic perturbations are drastically dierent. We then apply our results to develop a stochastic version of the Landau-Lifshitz equation. We discuss in particular previous results obtain by Etore and al. in [P. 'Etore, S.Labbe, J.

We compare results from a LambdaCDM simulation with a LambdaWDM (2keV) simulation that forms significantly less small scale structure. We show how high mass and force resolution in both the gas and dark matter components play an important role in solving the angular momentum catastrophe claimed from previous simulations of galaxy formation within the hierarchical framework. The stellar material in the disk component has a final specific angular momentum equal to 40% and 90% of that of the dark halo in the LambdaCDM and LambdaWDM models respectively. The LambdaWDM galaxy has a drastically reduced satellite population and a negligible stellar spheroidal component. Encounters with satellites play only a minor role in disturbing the disk. Satellites possess a variety of star formation histories linked to mergers and pericentric passages along their orbit around the primary galaxy. In both cosmologies, the galactic halo retains most of the baryons accreted and builds up a hot gas phase with a substantial X-ray emission. Therefore, while we have been successful in creating a realistic stellar disk in a massive galaxy within the LambdaCDM scenario, energy injection emerges as necessary ingredient to reduce the baryon fraction in galactic halos, independent of the cosmology adopted.

        "Abstract": "A comprehensive theoretical description is given for the spin relaxation and diffusion in solids. The formulation is made in a general statistical-mechanical way. The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

Yet, deriving the expansion's coefficients for complex systems might require a significant and non-trivial manipulation of the model, or the computation of large numbers of simulation runs, rendering the approach too time consuming and impracticable for applications with more than a handful of random variables. We introduce a novel computationally tractable technique for computing the coefficients of polynomial chaos expansions. The approach exploits a regularization technique with a particular choice of weighting matrices, which allow to take into account the specific features of Polynomial Chaos expansions. The method, completely based on convex optimization, can be applied to problems with a large number of random variables and uses a modest number of Monte Carlo simulations, while avoiding model manipulations. Additional information on the stochastic process, when available, can be also incorporated in the approach by means of convex constraints. We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in three applications in diverse fields, including the analysis of a nonlinear electric circuit, a chaotic model of organizational behavior, finally a chemical oscillator."

This quantity is a measure of the average mixedness of A after such measurement, and its minimum over all local measurements is shown to be the associated entanglement of formation between A and a purifying third system C. In the case of the von Neumann entropy, this minimum determines also the quantum discord. For classically correlated states and mixtures of a pure state with the maximally mixed state, we show that the minimizing measurement can be determined analytically and is universal, i.e., the same for all concave forms. While these properties no longer hold for general states, we also show that in the special case of the linear entropy, an explicit expression for the associated conditional entropy can be obtained, whose minimum among projective measurements in a general qudit-qubit state can be determined analytically, in terms of the largest eigenvalue of a simple 3x3 correlation matrix. Such minimum determines the maximum conditional purity of A, and the associated minimizing measurement is shown to be also universal in the vicinity of maximal mixedness. Results for X states, including typical reduced states of spin pairs in XY chains at weak and strong transverse fields, are also provided and indicate that the measurements minimizing the von Neumann and linear conditional entropies are typically coincident in these states, being determined essentially by the main correlation. They can differ, however, substantially from that minimizing the geometric discord."

The model couples a Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman (CHB) system with a elliptic reaction-diffusion equation for a nutrient. The fluid velocity, governed by the Brinkman law, is not solenodial, as its divergence is a function of the nutrient and the phase field variable, i.e., solution-dependent, and frictionless boundary conditions are prescribed for the velocity to avoid imposing unrealistic constraints on the divergence relation. In this paper we give a first result on the existence of weak and stationary solutions to the CHB model with singular potentials, specifically the double obstacle potential and the logarithmic potential, which ensures the phase field variable stay in the physically relevant interval. New difficulties arise from the interplay between the singular potentials and the solution-dependent source terms, but can be overcome with several key estimates for the approximations of the singular potentials, which may be of independent interests. As a consequence, included in our analysis is a weak existence result for a Darcy variant, and our work serve to generalise recent results on weak and stationary solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard inpainting model with singular potentials."

Based on the concept of system control theory, the unitary transformation is applied to change the time-dependent target function into a stationary target state so that the orbit tracking problem is changed into the state transfer one. A Lyapunov function with virtual mechanical quantity P is employed to design a control law for such a state transferring. The target states in density matrix are grouped into two classes: diagonal and non-diagonal. The specific convergent conditions for target state of diagonal mixed-states are derived. In the case that the target state is a non-diagonal superposition state, we propose a non-diagonal P construction method; if the target state is a non-diagonal mixed-state we use a unitary transformation to change it into a diagonal state and design a diagonal P. In such a way, the orbit tracking problem with arbitrary initial state is properly solved. The explicit expressions of P are derived to obtain a convergent control law. At last, the system simulation experiments are performed on a two-level quantum system and the tracking process is illustrated on the Bloch sphere."

Restricting the public discussion to be a linear function of the terminals' observations, we obtain a characterization of the communication complexity (minimum number of symbols of public discussion) of generating a secret key of maximum length. The minimum discussion is achieved by a non-interactive protocol in which each terminal first does a linear processing of its own private observations, following which the terminals all execute a discussion-optimal communication-for-omniscience protocol. The secret key is finally obtained as a linear function of the vector of all observations."

Hence such an observer can neither create a warp bubble on demand nor control one once it has been created. In addition, such a bubble requires negative energy densities. One might hope that elimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that although the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In our four dimensional extension of this metric, a ``tube'' is constructed along the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star. Inside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to allow superluminal travel in one direction. We show that, although a single Krasnikov tube does not involve closed timelike curves, a time machine can be constructed with a system of two non-overlapping tubes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Krasnikov tubes, like warp bubbles and traversable wormholes, also involve unphysically thin layers of negative energy density, as well as large total negative energies, and therefore probably cannot be realized in practice."

In order to include all the relevant physical ingredients (2-body relaxation, stellar mass spectrum, collisions, tidal disruption,...), we chose to revive a numerical scheme pioneered by Henon in the 70's. It is basically a Monte Carlo resolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. It can cope with any stellar mass spectrum or velocity distribution. Being a particle-based method, it also allows one to take stellar collisions into account in a very realistic way. This first paper covers the basic version of our code which treats the relaxation-driven evolution of stellar cluster without a central BH. A technical description of the code is presented, as well as the results of test computations. Thanks to the use of a binary tree to store potential and rank information and of variable time steps, cluster models with up to 2 million particles can be simulated on a standard personal computer and the CPU time required scales as N*ln(N) with the particle number N. Furthermore, the number of simulated stars needs not be equal to N but can be arbitrarily larger. A companion paper will treat further physical ingredients, mostly relevant to galactic nuclei."

A key focus of recent machine-learning advances in this area is on modeling program semantics instead of just syntax. Unfortunately evaluating such advances is not obvious, as program semantics does not lend itself to straightforward metrics. In this paper, we introduce a benchmarking framework called COSET for standardizing the evaluation of neural program embeddings. COSET consists of a diverse dataset of programs in source-code format, labeled by human experts according to a number of program properties of interest. A point of novelty is a suite of program transformations included in COSET. These transformations when applied to the base dataset can simulate natural changes to program code due to optimization and refactoring and can serve as a \"debugging\" tool for classification mistakes. We conducted a pilot study on four prominent models: TreeLSTM, gated graph neural network (GGNN), AST-Path neural network (APNN), and DYPRO. We found that COSET is useful in identifying the strengths and limitations of each model and in pinpointing specific syntactic and semantic characteristics of programs that pose challenges."

We demonstrate that the dynamics of the FRW model with dark energy in the form of phantom field can be regarded as a scattering process of two types: multiple chaotic and classical non-chaotic. It depends whether the spontaneously symmetry breaking takes place. In the first class of models with the spontaneously symmetry breaking the dynamics is similar to the Yang-Mills theory. We find the evidence of a fractal structure in the phase space of initial conditions. We observe similarities to the phenomenon of a multiple scattering process around the origin. In turn the class of models without the spontaneously symmetry breaking can be described as the classical non-chaotic scattering process and the methods of symbolic dynamic are also used in this case. We show that the phantom cosmology can be treated as a simple model with scattering of trajectories which character depends crucially on a sign of a square of mass. We demonstrate that there is a possibility of chaotic behavior in the flat Universe with a conformally coupled phantom field in the system considered on non-zero energy level. We obtain that the acceleration is a generic feature in the considered model without the spontaneously symmetry breaking. We observe that the effective EOS coefficient oscillates and then approach to $w=-1$."

As interleaving and de-interleaving are performed within a block, the message-passing process associated with an iterative decoder is limited to proceed within the corresponding range. This paper presents a new turbo coding scheme that uses a special interleaver structure and a multiple-round early termination test involving both sign check and a CRC code. The new interleaver structure is naturally suited for high speed parallel processing and the resulting coding system offers new design options and tradeoffs that are not available to CTCs. In particular, it becomes possible for the decoder to employ an efficient inter-block collaborative decoding algorithm, passing the information obtained from termination test proved blocks to other unproved blocks. It also becomes important to have a proper decoding schedule. The combined effect is improved performance and reduction in the average decoding delay (whence the required computing power). A memory (storage) management mechanism is included as a critical part of the decoder so as to provide additional design tradeoff between performance and memory size. It is shown that the latter has a modular-like effect in that additional memory units render enhanced performance due not only to less forced early terminations but to possible increases of the interleaving depth. Depending on the decoding schedule, the degree of parallelism and other decoding resources available, the proposed scheme admits a variety of decoder architectures that meet a large range of throughput and performance demands."

A few measures of information flow have been proposed previously in the literature, and measures of directed causal influence are currently being used as a heuristic proxy for information flow. However, there is as yet no rigorous treatment of the problem with formal definitions and clearly stated assumptions, and the process of defining information flow is often conflated with the problem of estimating it. In this work, we provide a new information-theoretic definition for information flow in a computational system, which we motivate using a series of examples. We then show that this definition satisfies intuitively desirable properties, including the existence of \"information paths\", along which information flows from the input of the computational system to its output. Finally, we describe how information flow might be estimated in a noiseless setting, and provide an algorithm to identify information paths on the time-unrolled graph of a computational system."

This is consistent with the Randall-Sundrum model in which each 3-brane Lagrangian separated out a constant vacuum energy. By adopting an anisotropic metric ansatz, we obtain the 5d Friedmann-Robertson-Walker field equations. At a little later period, the expansion of the universe is proportional to $t^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ which is as similar as the period of the radiation-dominated. We also investigate the case with two $a(t)$ and two $b(t)$. In a large region of $t$, we obtain the 3d effective cosmological constant $\\Lambda_{eff}=-2\\Omega/3>0$ which is independent of the integral constant.

The result indicates that a kinetic area-cells model of the BH's horizon can model the evolution of BH due to the Hawking radiation, and this area-cell system can be considered as an interacting geometrical particle system. Thus the evolution turns into a problem of statistical physics. In the present work, this problem is treated in the framework of non-equilibrium statistics. It is proposed that each area-cell possesses the energy like a microscopic black hole, and has the gravitational interaction with the other area-cells. We consider both a non-interaction ideal system, and a system with small nearest-neighbor interactions, and obtain an analytic expression of the expected value of the horizon area of a dynamical BH. We find that, after a long enough evolution, a dynamical BH with the Hawking radiation can be in equilibrium with a finite temperature radiation field. However, we also find that, the system has a critical point, and when the temperature of the radiation field surrounding the BH approaches the critical temperature of the BH, a critical slowing down phenomenon occurs."

Such $A$ arises naturally in the $q\\to -1$ limit for a symmetry operator of a specific self-similar potential obeying the $q$-Weyl algebra, $AA^\\dagger-q^2A^\\dagger A=1$. Coherent states for this and other reflectionless potentials whose discrete spectra consist of $N$ geometric series are analyzed.

A special degenerate form of the symmetry algebras of self-similar potentials is found to provide a natural $q$-analog of the Floquet theory.

These are multivariate polynomial codes whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a multiplicity code (Kopparty, Saraf, Yekhanin 2014). We show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and a notion of locality called the $t$-disjoint-repair-group property than previously known constructions. More precisely, we show that lifted multiplicity codes with length $N$ and redundancy $O(t^{0.585} \\sqrt{N})$ have the property that any symbol of a codeword can be reconstructed in $t$ different ways, each using a disjoint subset of the other coordinates. This gives the best known trade-off for this problem for any super-constant $t < \\sqrt{N}$.

The authors recognized that in general the eigenvalues due not correspond to the spectrum of a compact operator and hence proposed a modified eigenvalue problem with the desired properties.   The present article considers the original and the modified electromagnetic Stekloff eigenvalue problem. We cast the problems as eigenvalue problem for a holomorphic operator function $A(\\cdot)$. We construct a \"test function operator function\" $T(\\cdot)$ so that $A(\\lambda)$ is weakly $T(\\lambda)$-coercive for all suitable $\\lambda$, i.e. $T(\\lambda)^*A(\\lambda)$ is a compact perturbation of a coercive operator. The construction of $T(\\cdot)$ relies on a suitable decomposition of the function space into subspaces and an apt sign change on each subspace.   For the approximation analysis, we apply the framework of T-compatible Galerkin approximations. For the modified problem, we prove that convenient commuting projection operators imply T-compatibility and hence convergence. For the original problem, we require the projection operators to satisfy an additional commutator property involving the tangential trace.

Rystsov proved one instance of this conjecture, namely, degree $n$ primitive groups synchronize maps of rank $n-1$ (thus, maps with kernel type $(2,1,\\ldots,1)$). We prove some extensions of Rystsov's result, including this: a primitive group synchronizes every map whose kernel type is $(k,1,\\ldots,1)$. Incidentally this result provides a new characterization of imprimitive groups. We also prove that the conjecture above holds for maps of extreme ranks, that is, ranks 3, 4 and $n-2$.   These proofs use a graph-theoretic technique due to the second author: a transformation semigroup fails to contain a constant map if and only if it is contained in the endomorphism semigroup of a non-null (simple undircted) graph.

        "Title": "Higher-order Accurate Spectral Density Estimation of Functional Time  Series",
        "Abstract": "Under the frequency domain framework for weakly dependent functional time series, a key element is the spectral density kernel which encapsulates the second-order dynamics of the process. We propose a class of spectral density kernel estimators based on the notion of a flat-top kernel. The new class of estimators employs the inverse Fourier transform of a flat-top function as the weight function employed to smooth the periodogram. It is shown that using a flat-top kernel yields a bias reduction and results in a higher-order accuracy in terms of optimizing the integrated mean square error (IMSE). Notably, the higher-order accuracy of flat-top estimation comes at the sacrifice of the positive semi-definite property. Nevertheless, we show how a flat-top estimator can be modified to become positive semi-definite (even strictly positive definite) in finite samples while retaining its favorable asymptotic properties. In addition, we introduce a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure realized by an automatic inspection of the estimated correlation structure. Our asymptotic results are complemented by a finite-sample simulation where the higher-order accuracy of flat-top estimators is manifested in practice."

        "Title": "Pruned Bit-Reversal Permutations: Mathematical Characterization, Fast  Algorithms and Architectures",
        "Abstract": "A mathematical characterization of serially-pruned permutations (SPPs) employed in variable-length permuters and their associated fast pruning algorithms and architectures are proposed. Permuters are used in many signal processing systems for shuffling data and in communication systems as an adjunct to coding for error correction. Typically only a small set of discrete permuter lengths are supported. Serial pruning is a simple technique to alter the length of a permutation to support a wider range of lengths, but results in a serial processing bottleneck. In this paper, parallelizing SPPs is formulated in terms of recursively computing sums involving integer floor and related functions using integer operations, in a fashion analogous to evaluating Dedekind sums. A mathematical treatment for bit-reversal permutations (BRPs) is presented, and closed-form expressions for BRP statistics are derived. It is shown that BRP sequences have weak correlation properties. A new statistic called permutation inliers that characterizes the pruning gap of pruned interleavers is proposed. Using this statistic, a recursive algorithm that computes the minimum inliers count of a pruned BR interleaver (PBRI) in logarithmic time complexity is presented. This algorithm enables parallelizing a serial PBRI algorithm by any desired parallelism factor by computing the pruning gap in lookahead rather than a serial fashion, resulting in significant reduction in interleaving latency and memory overhead. Extensions to 2-D block and stream interleavers, as well as applications to pruned fast Fourier transforms and LTE turbo interleavers, are also presented. Moreover, hardware-efficient architectures for the proposed algorithms are developed. Simulation results demonstrate 3 to 4 orders of magnitude improvement in interleaving time compared to existing approaches."

But the very existence of it was demonstrated in a case-by-case fashion. Here a conceptual explanation for that empirical observation is given. The main results are: 1) there is a natural mapping $\\tau$ from the set of all nontrivial Abelian ideals to the set of long positive roots; 2) If $I$ is a maximal Abelian ideal, then $\\tau(I)$ is a long simple root. Restricting $\\tau$ to the set of maximal Abelian ideals yields the above-mentioned correspondence; 3) Each fibre of $\\tau$ is a poset in its own right, and we prove that this fibre has a unique maximal and a unique minimal element. 4) An explicit description of the minimal and the maximal ideal corresponding to a long root is given."

        "Abstract": "This paper shows how, in a quasi metric space, an inexact proximal algorithm with a generalized perturbation term appears to be a nice tool for Behavioral Sciences (Psychology, Economics, Management, Game theory,...). More precisely, the new perturbation term represents an index of resistance to change, defined as a \"curved enough\" function of the quasi distance between two successive iterates. Using this behavioral point of view, the present paper shows how such a generalized inexact proximal algorithm can modelize the formation of habits and routines in a striking way. This idea comes from a recent \"variational rationality approach\" of human behavior which links a lot of different theories of stability (habits, routines, equilibrium, traps,...) and changes (creations, innovations, learning and destructions,...) in Behavioral Sciences and a lot of concepts and algorithms in Variational Analysis. In this variational context, the perturbation term represents a specific instance of the very general concept of resistance to change, which is the disutility of some inconvenients to change. Central to the analysis are the original variational concepts of \"worthwhile changes\" and \"marginal worthwhile stays\". At the behavioral level, this paper advocates that proximal algorithms are well suited to modelize the emergence of habituation/routinized human behaviors. We show when, and at which speed, a \"worthwhile to change\" process converges to a behavioral trap."

These spaces belong to the interesting class of normalizing linear spaces, namely, those linear spaces U for which UU*U is a subset of U. Such a space is reflexive whenever it is ultraweakly closed, and then it is of the form U={x:xp=h(p)x, for all p in P}, where P is a set of projections and h a certain map defined on P. A normalizing space consists of normalizers between appropriate von Neumann algebras A and B. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for a normalizing space to consist of normalizers between two reflexive algebras. Normalizing spaces which are bimodules over maximal abelian selfadjoint algebras consist of operators `supported' on sets of the form [f=g] where f and g are appropriate Borel functions. They also satisfy spectral synthesis in the sense of Arveson."

The algebra of observables is generated by finite dimensional spin networks drawn on a punctured topological surface. Our main result is a construction of a unitary representation of this algebra. For this purpose, we use the formalism of combinatorial quantization of Chern-Simons theory, i.e we quantize the algebra of polynomial functions on the space of flat SL(2,C)-connections on a topological surface with punctures. This algebra admits a unitary representation acting on an Hilbert space which consists in wave packets of spin-networks associated to principal unitary representations of the quantum Lorentz group. This representation is constructed using only Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of a tensor product of a finite dimensional representation with a principal unitary representation. The proof of unitarity of this representation is non trivial and is a consequence of properties of intertwiners which are studied in depth. We analyze the relationship between the insertion of a puncture colored with a principal representation and the presence of a world-line of a massive spinning particle in de Sitter space."

To answer the question if the observation of GW170817, GRB170817A, and AT2017gfo could be explained by the merger of a neutron star with a black hole, we perform a joint multi-messenger analysis of the gravitational waves, the short gamma-ray burst, and the kilonova.

In both cases we obtain the quantum-backreacted metric analytically. In the black hole case, we explore the quantum corrections on different regions of relevance for a rotating black hole geometry. We find that the quantum effects lead to a growth of both the event horizon and the ergosphere, as well as to a reduction of the angular velocity compared to their corresponding unperturbed values. Quantum corrections also give rise to the formation of a curvature singularity at the Cauchy horizon and show no evidence of the appearance of a superradiant instability. In the naked singularity case, quantum effects lead to the formation of a horizon that hides the conical defect, thus turning it into a black hole. The fact that these effects occur not only for static but also for spinning geometries makes a strong case for the r\\^ole of quantum mechanics as a cosmic censor in Nature."

        "Abstract": "A data-driven approach to elucidating the nature of the dark energy, in the form of a joint analysis of a full set of cosmological parameters, utilizing all available observational data is proposed. A parameterization of a generalized dark energy is developed with the extension of fluid perturbation theory to models which cross through an equation of state of -1. This parameterization is selected to be general enough to admit a wide variety of behavior, while still being physical and economical. A Fisher matrix analysis with future high-precision CMB, cluster survey, and SNIa data suggests the parameters will probably be resolvable in the foreseeable future. How accurately the parameters can be determined depends sensitively on the nature of the dark energy - particularly how significant of a fraction of the total energy density it has been in the past. Parameter space will be sampled at a large number of points, with cosmological information such as CMB, power spectra, etc of each point being archived. Thus the likelihood functions of an arbitrary set of experiments can be applied to parameter space with insignificant new computational cost, making a wide variety of analyses possible. The resulting tool for Analysis and Resolution of Dark-sector Attributes, ARDA, will be highly versatile and adaptable. ARDA will allow the scientific community to extract parameters with an arbitrary set of experiments and theoretical priors, test for tension between classes of observations and investigate the effectiveness of hypothetical experiments, while evolving in a data-driven manner.

The burst was apparently associated with the optically (restframe UV) brightest component of a system of at least five galaxies or galaxy fragments at a redshift of z = 1.0969. The component we identify as the host galaxy shows a moderately high unobscured star formation rate, SFR = 5 M_solar/yr, but a high SFR per unit mass, indicative of a starburst. The image components show a broad range of (R-K) colors, with two of them being very red, possibly due to dust. Overall morphology of the system can be naturally interpreted as a strong tidal interaction of two or more galaxies, at a redshift where such events were much more common than now. Given the well established causal link between galaxy mergers and starbursts, we propose that this is a strong case for a GRB originating from a merger-induced starburst system. This supports the proposed link between GRBs and massive star formation."

In this context classical thermodynamics appears as a particular theory suited to a subset of all dynamical systems. A statistical mechanics similar to the one derived with the microcanonical ensemble emerges from dynamical systems provided it contains, 1) a finite non-integrable part of its phase space which is, 2) ergodic at a satisfactory degree after a finite time. The integrable part of phase space provides the constraints that shape the particular system macroscopical properties, and the chaotic part provides well behaved statistical properties over a relevant finite time. More generic semi-ergodic systems lead to intermittent behaviour, thus may be unsuited for a statistical description of steady states. Following these lines of thought, in a second part non-extensive hierarchical systems with statistical scale-invariance and power law interactions are explored. Only the virial constraint, consistent with their microdynamics, is included. No assumptions of classical thermodynamics are used, in particular extensivity and local homogeneity. In the limit of a large hierarchical range new constraints emerge in some conditions that depend on the interaction law range. In particular for the gravitational case, a velocity-site scaling relation is derived which is consistant with the ones empirically observed in the fractal interstellar medium."

We moreover show that a large variety of specification monads can be obtained by applying monad transformers to various base specification monads, including predicate transformers and Hoare-style pre- and postconditions. For defining correct monad transformers, we propose a language inspired by Moggi's monadic metalanguage that is parameterized by a dependent type theory. We also develop a notion of algebraic operations for Dijkstra monads, and start to investigate two ways of also accommodating effect handlers. We implement our framework in both Coq and F*, and illustrate that it supports a wide variety of verification styles for effects such as exceptions, nondeterminism, state, input-output, and general recursion."

We present a kinetic model of nonthermal electron injection, acceleration and propagation in that environment and find that these SNRs are efficient electron accelerators and sources of hard X- and gamma-ray emission. The energy spectrum of the nonthermal electrons is shaped by the joint action of first and second order Fermi acceleration in a turbulent plasma with substantial Coulomb losses. Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and inverse Compton radiation of the nonthermal electrons produce multiwavelength photon spectra in quantitative agreement with the radio and the hard emission observed by ASCA and EGRET from IC 443. We distinguish interclump shock wave emission from molecular clump shock wave emission accounting for a complex structure of molecular cloud. Spatially resolved X- and gamma- ray spectra from the supernova remnants IC 443, W44, and 3C391 as might be observed with BeppoSAX, Chandra XRO, XMM, INTEGRAL and GLAST would distinguish the contribution of the energetic lepton component to the gamma-rays observed by EGRET."

The involution and the C*-norm of the C*-algebra of ''compact'' module operators on a Hilbert C*-module allow to recover its original C*-valued inner product up to the following equivalence relation: <.,.>_1 \\sim <.,.>_2 if and only if there exists an invertible, positive element $a$ of the center of the multiplier C*-algebra M(A) of A such that the identity <.,.>_1 \\equiv a \\cdot <.,.>_2 holds."

In this limit the renormalized mass of the asymptotic theory is finite. Moreover, the limiting theory exhibits universal properties. For a non-Hermitian $\\cal PT$-symmetric Lagrangian lacking parity symmetry, whose interaction term has the form $-g(i\\phi)^N/N$, the renormalized mass diverges in this correlated limit. Nevertheless, the asymptotic theory still has interesting properties. For example, the one-point Green's function approaches the value $-i\\alpha^{1/(N-2)}$ independently of the space-time dimension $D$ for $D<2$. Moreover, while the Ising limit of a parity-symmetric quantum field theory is dominated by a dilute instanton gas, the corresponding correlated limit of a $\\cal PT$-symmetric quantum field theory without parity symmetry is dominated by a constant-field configuration with corrections determined by a weak-coupling expansion in which the expansion parameter (the amplitude of the vertices of the graphs in this expansion) is proportional to an inverse power of $g$. We thus observe a weak-coupling/strong-coupling duality in that while the Ising limit is a strong-coupling limit of the quantum field theory, the expansion about this limit takes the form of a conventional weak-coupling expansion. A possible generalization of the Ising limit to dimensions $D<4$ is briefly discussed."

For low energy density $U$ a collapsed phase is identified, while in the high energy limit the particles are homogeneously distributed. A phase transition from the collapsed to the homogeneous state occurs at critical energy U_c. A theoretical analysis within the canonical ensemble identifies such a transition as first order. But microcanonical simulations reveal a negative specific heat regime near $U_c$. The dynamical behaviour of the system is affected by this transition : below U_c anomalous diffusion is observed, while for U > U_c the motion of the particles is almost ballistic. In the collapsed phase, finite $N$-effects act like a noise source of variance O(1/N), that restores normal diffusion on a time scale diverging with N. As a consequence, the asymptotic diffusion coefficient will also diverge algebraically with N and superdiffusion will be observable at any time in the limit N \\to \\infty.

Placing the sample under a uniform pressure load results in bulging of the graphene membrane and subsequent softening of the main Raman features, due to tensile strain. In such a microcavity, the intensity of the Raman features depends very sensitively on the distance between the graphene membrane and the Si substrate, which acts as the bottom mirror of the cavity. Thus, a spatially resolved analysis of the intensity of the G- and 2D-mode features as a function of the pressure load permits a direct reconstruction of the blister profile. An average strain is then deduced at each pressure load, and Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameters of $1.8\\pm0.2$ and $2.4\\pm0.2$ are determined for the Raman G and 2D modes, respectively. In addition, the measured blister height is proportional to the cubic root of the pressure load, as predicted theoretically. The validation of this scaling provides a direct and accurate determination the Young's modulus of graphene with a purely optical, hence contactless and minimally invasive, approach. We find a Young's modulus of $(1.05\\pm 0.10) \\rm TPa$ for monolayer graphene, in a perfect match with previous nanoindentation measurements.

        "Abstract": "Given a graphical model (GM), computing its partition function is the most essential inference task, but it is computationally intractable in general. To address the issue, iterative approximation algorithms exploring certain local structure/consistency of GM have been investigated as popular choices in practice. However, due to their local/iterative nature, they often output poor approximations or even do not converge, e.g., in low-temperature regimes (hard instances of large parameters). To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel approach utilizing the global spectral feature of GM. Our contribution is two-fold: (a) we first propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for approximating the partition function of GM associating with a low-rank coupling matrix; (b) for general high-rank GMs, we design a spectral mean-field scheme utilizing (a) as a subroutine, where it approximates a high-rank GM into a product of rank-1 GMs for an efficient approximation of the partition function. The proposed algorithm is more robust in its running time and accuracy than prior methods, i.e., neither suffers from the convergence issue nor depends on hard local structures, as demonstrated in our experiments."

Above 40 keV in an air-coupled 2\" x 2\" NaI scintillator, the SiPM dark count rate was reduced by a factor of about 1000 when cooled. Spectroscopic performance when cooled was very similar to a PMT tested in the same setup, and adequate for nuclear spectrsocopy above 25 keV. Originally, water cooling was used but it was replaced by air cooling which is more suitable for a self-contained system, giving the advantage of portability without degrading performance. Straightforward improvements would allow cooling the SiPM to -30 C or below, which would further reduce the dark count rate and extend the spectroscopically useful range to even lower energies. Such a system would be rugged and suitable for field use, for instance for inspection of cargo for gamma ray emissions."

The decoding stage then attempts to reconstruct the input according to such intermediate representation. The reconstruction error is thus considered as a weak gait index.

Our experiments on a large dataset (nearly one hundred thousand skeletons) showed that the index given by the proposed method outperformed some recent works on gait analysis."

In both cases, the object is treated as a global entity, and a single pose estimate is computed. As a consequence, the resulting techniques can be vulnerable to large occlusions.   In this paper, we introduce a segmentation-driven 6D pose estimation framework where each visible part of the objects contributes a local pose prediction in the form of 2D keypoint locations. We then use a predicted measure of confidence to combine these pose candidates into a robust set of 3D-to-2D correspondences, from which a reliable pose estimate can be obtained. We outperform the state-of-the-art on the challenging Occluded-LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets, which is evidence that our approach deals well with multiple poorly-textured objects occluding each other.

        "Abstract": "We investigate strong coupling effects on the superfluid phase transition in a gas of Fermi atoms with a Feshbach resonance. The Feshbach resonance describes a composite quasi-Boson, which can give rise to an additional pairing interaction between the Fermi atoms. This attractive interaction becomes stronger as the threshold energy of the Feshbach resonance two-particle bound state is lowered. In a recent paper, we showed that in the uniform Fermi gas, this tunable pairing interaction naturally leads to a BCS-BEC crossover of the Nozi`eres and Schmitt-Rink kind, in which the BCS-type superfluid phase transition continuously changes into the BEC-type as the threshold energy is decreased. In this paper, we extend our previous work by including the effect of a harmonic trap potential, treated within the local density approximation (LDA). We also give results for both weak and strong coupling to the Feshbach resonance. We show that the BCS-BEC crossover phenomenon strongly modifies the shape of the atomic density profile at the superfluid phase transition temperature Tc, reflecting the change of the dominant particles going from Fermi atoms to composite Bosons. In the BEC regime, these composite Bosons are shown to first appear well above Tc. We also discuss the \"phase diagram\" above Tc as a function of the tunable threshold energy. We introduce a characteristic temperature T* describing the effective crossover in the normal phase from a Fermi gas of atoms to a gas of stable molecules."

At the TeV scale there are additional scalars, gauge bosons, and vector-like charge 2/3 quarks, whose couplings to the Higgs greatly reduce the UV sensitivity of the Higgs potential. Stabilization of the Higgs mass squared parameter, without finetuning, occurs due to a softly broken shift symmetry--the Higgs is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. Above the 10 TeV scale the theory has new strongly coupled interactions. A perturbatively renormalizable UV completion, with softly broken supersymmetry at 10 TeV is explicitly worked out. Our theory contains new particles which are odd under an exact \"dark matter parity\", (-1)^{(2S+3B+L)}. We argue that such a parity is likely to be a feature of many theories of new TeV scale physics. The lightest parity odd particle, or \"LPOP\", is most likely a neutral fermion, and may make a good dark matter candidate, with similar experimental signatures to the neutralino of the MSSM. We give a general effective field theory analysis of the calculation of corrections to precision electroweak observables."

Wiesbrock has shown that strongly additive nets of von Neumann algebras on the circle are in correspondence with standard half-sided modular inclusions. We show that a finite index endomorphism on a half-sided modular inclusion extends to a finite index endomorphism on the corresponding net of von Neumann algebras on the circle. Moreover, we present another approach to encoding endomorphisms on nets of Neumann algebras on the circle into half-sided modular inclusions. There is a natural way to associate a weight to a Moebius covariant endomorphism. The properties of this weight has been studied by Bertozzini, Conti and Longo. In this paper we show the converse, namely how to associate a Moebius covariant endomorphism to a given weight under certain assumptions, thus obtaining a correspondence between a class of weights on a half-sided modular inclusion and a subclass of the Moebius covariant endomorphisms on the associated net of von Neumann algebras. This allows us to treat Moebius covariant endomorphisms in terms of weights on half-sided modular inclusions. As our aim is to provide a framework for treating endomorphisms on nets of von Neumann algebras in terms of the apparently simpler objects of weights on half-sided modular inclusions, we lastly give some basic results for manipulations with such weights."

The periodic driving, we employ here, is adiabatically switched on to break the particle-hole symmetry and generate a chiral mass term in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian; consequently the Floquet Hamiltonian also gets deformed without crossing the gapless critical point. The particle hole symmetry is subsequently restored in the Floquet Hamiltonian by adiabatically switching off a part of the periodic potential. Thereafter, the Floquet Hamiltonian develops a symmetry protected non-trivial topological winding number. Furthermore, we also observe stroboscopic topologically protected localised edge states in a long open chain and show that a bulk boundary correspondence survives a unitary non-equilibrium situation in 1D BDI Hamiltonians."

Several different materials have been used to weakly couple superconductors, such as tunnel barriers, normal metals, or semiconductors. Here, we study supercurrents through a quantum dot created in a semiconductor nanowire by local electrostatic gating. Due to strong Coulomb interaction, electrons only tunnel one-by-one through the discrete energy levels of the quantum dot. This nevertheless can yield a supercurrent when subsequent tunnel events are coherent. These quantum coherent tunnelling processes can result in either a positive or a negative supercurrent, i.e. in a normal or a pi-junction, respectively. We demonstrate that the supercurrent reverses sign by adding a single electron spin to the quantum dot. When excited states of the quantum dot are involved in transport, the supercurrent sign also depends on the character of the orbital wavefunctions."

This may be done for general Lie groups, resulting in an extension of Lie algebras and group manifolds.

Afterwards, a general connection which includes a two-form field is settled-down, solving the problem of setting a gauge theory for the Kalb-Ramond field for generical groups.   Topological Chern-Simons theories can also be defined in four dimensions, and this approach clarifies their relation to the so-called $B \\wedge F$-theories. We also revise some standard aspects of Kalb-Ramond theories in view of these new perspectives.   Since this gauge connection is built upon a pair of fields consisting of a one-form and a two-form, one may define Yang-Mills theories as usually and, remarkably, also {\\it minimal coupling} with bosonic matter, where the Kalb-Ramond field appears naturally as mediator; so, a new associated conserved charge can be defined. For the Abelian case, we explicitly construct the minimal interaction between $B$-field and matter following a \"gauge principle\" and find a novel conserved tensor current. This is our most significative result from the physical viewpoint.   This framework is also generalized in such a way that any $p$-rank tensor may be formulated as a gauge field."

        "Abstract": "It is theoretically expected that a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the centre of a typical nearby galaxy disrupts a Solar-type star every ~ 10^5 years, resulting in a bright flare lasting for months. Sgr A*, the resident SMBH of the Milky Way, produces (by comparison) tiny flares that last only hours but occur daily. Here we explore the possibility that these flares could be produced by disruption of smaller bodies - asteroids. We show that asteroids passing within an AU of Sgr A* could be split into smaller fragments which then vaporise by bodily friction with the tenuous quiescent gas accretion flow onto Sgr A*. The ensuing shocks and plasma instabilities may create a transient population of very hot electrons invoked in several currently popular models for Sgr A* flares, thus producing the required spectra. We estimate that asteroids larger than ~ 10 km in size are needed to power the observed flares, with the maximum possible luminosity of the order 10^39 erg s^-1. Assuming that the asteroid population per parent star in the central parsec of the Milky Way is not too dissimilar from that around stars in the Solar neighbourhood, we estimate the asteroid disruption rates, and the distribution of the expected luminosities, finding a reasonable agreement with the observations. We also note that planets may be tidally disrupted by Sgr A* as well, also very infrequently. We speculate that one such disruption may explain the putative increase in Sgr A* luminosity ~ 300 yr ago."

        "Abstract": "The ``warp drive'' metric recently presented by Alcubierre has the problem that an observer at the center of the warp bubble is causally separated from the outer edge of the bubble wall. Hence such an observer can neither create a warp bubble on demand nor control one once it has been created. In addition, such a bubble requires negative energy densities. One might hope that elimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that although the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In our four dimensional extension of this metric, a ``tube'' is constructed along the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star. Inside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to allow superluminal travel in one direction. We show that, although a single Krasnikov tube does not involve closed timelike curves, a time machine can be constructed with a system of two non-overlapping tubes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Krasnikov tubes, like warp bubbles and traversable wormholes, also involve unphysically thin layers of negative energy density, as well as large total negative energies, and therefore probably cannot be realized in practice."

A particular challenge in imitation learning is the so-called correspondence problem, which involves mapping actions between a teacher and a learner having substantially different embodiments (say, human to robot). We present a general, model free and non-parametric imitation learning algorithm based on regression between two Hilbert spaces. We accomplish this via Kirszbraun's extension theorem --- apparently the first application of this technique to supervised learning --- and analyze its statistical and computational aspects. We begin by formulating the correspondence problem in terms of quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) regression. Then we describe a procedure for smoothing the training data, which amounts to regularizing hypothesis complexity via its Lipschitz constant. The Lipschitz constant is tuned via a Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) procedure, based on the covering-number risk bounds we derive.

We compare the 2-colour parity to other parity theories of virtual links, focusing on a theory due to Im and Park. The 2-colour parity yields a strictly stronger invariant than the Im-Park parity. We introduce an invariant, the 2-colour writhe, that takes the form of a string of integers. The 2-colour writhe is a concordance invariant, and so obstructs sliceness. It is also an obstruction to amphichirality and chequerboard colourability within a concordance class."

        "Abstract": "We develop a simple model for the evolution of a nucleon spin in a hot and dense nuclear medium. A given nucleon is limited to one-dimensional motion in a distribution of external, spin-dependent scattering potentials. We calculate the nucleon spin autocorrelation function numerically for a variety of potential densities and distributions which are meant to bracket realistic conditions in a supernova core. For all plausible configurations the width of the spin-density structure function is found to be less than the temperature. This is in contrast with a naive perturbative calculation based on the one-pion exchange potential which overestimates the width and thus suggests a large suppression of the neutrino opacities by nucleon spin fluctuations. Our results suggest that it may be justified to neglect the collisional broadening of the spin-density structure function for the purpose of estimating the neutrino opacities in the deep inner core of a supernova. On the other hand, we find no indication that processes such as axion or neutrino pair emission, which depend on nucleon spin fluctuations, are substantially suppressed beyond the multiple-scattering effect already discussed in the literature. Aside from these practical conclusions, our model reveals a number of interesting and unexpected insights. For example, the spin-relaxation rate saturates with increasing potential strength only if bound states are not allowed to form by including a repulsive core. There is no saturation with increasing density of scattering potentials until localized eigenstates of energy begin to form."

The jets are formed at a large (0.15 pc) distance from its central star by collimation of an asymmetric stellar wind in a pair of conical shocks seen in Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC2) images. The jets consist of several pairs of knots symmetrically distributed with respect to the central star, with most knots exhibiting a head-tail morphology. Large (up to 650 km/s) radial velocity gradients are seen within the knots on subarcsec scales, with velocities decreasing from the knot heads toward their trailing tails. These large velocity gradients are a sign of efficient deceleration of jets by a much slower bipolar outflow. The inclination angle of the bipolar outflow is equal to 40 degrees, based on Doppler shifts of the scattered stellar Halpha line. Its velocity is equal to 140 km/s at a distance of 0.23 pc from the star, and increases monotonically with the radial distance from the star. A comparison of new WFPC2 [N II] 6584 images with older WFPC2 images reveals expansion of the jets. The measured jet proper motions in combination with their radial velocities imply that He 3-1475 is a Galactic Bulge star at a distance of 8 kpc, located 800 pc above the Galactic plane. Its very high luminosity (25,000 solar luminosities) implies that He 3-1475 must be significantly more massive than a typical AGB star within the Galactic Bulge, perhaps because of a past mass transfer and/or a merger event in an interacting binary system."

It is shown that if the initial data for an expanding cosmological model of this type is subjected to a small perturbation then the corresponding solution exists globally in the future and the perturbation decays in a way which can be described precisely. It is emphasized that no linearization of the equations or special symmetry assumptions are needed. The result can also be interpreted as a proof of the nonlinear stability of the homogeneous models. In order to prove the theorem we write the general solution as the sum of a homogeneous background and a perturbation. As a by-product of the analysis it is found that there is an invariant sense in which an inhomogeneous model can be regarded as a perturbation of a unique homogeneous model. A method is given for associating uniquely to each Newtonian cosmological model with compact spatial sections a spatially homogeneous model which incorporates its large-scale dynamics. This procedure appears very natural in the Newton-Cartan theory which we take as the starting point for Newtonian cosmology."

A full study has been done for spherical particles with a +-20% size distribution. Stick-slip motion due to repetitive fluidization of the layer occurs for low driving velocities. Between major slip events, slight creep occurs that is variable from one event to the next. The effects of changing the stiffness k and velocity V of the driving system are studied in detail. The stick-slip motion is almost periodic for spherical particles over a wide range of parameters, but becomes irregular when k is large and V is relatively small. At larger V, the motion becomes smoother and is affected by the inertia of the upper plate bounding the layer. Measurements of the period T and amplitude A of the relative motion are presented as a function of V. At a critical value Vc, a transition to continuous sliding motion occurs that is discontinuous for k not too large. The time dependence of the instantaneous velocity of the upper plate and the frictional force produced by the granular layer are determined within individual slipping events. The force is a multi-valued function of the instantaneous velocity, with pronounced hysteresis and a sudden drop prior to resticking. Measurements of vertical displacement reveal a small dilation of the material (about one tenth of the mean particle size in a layer 20 particles deep) associated with each slip event. Finally, optical imaging reveals that localized microscopic rearrangements precede (and follow) each slip event. The behavior of smooth particles is contrasted with that of rough particles."

The class of languages recognisable by unambiguous tree automata is still not well-understood. In particular, decidability of the problem whether a given language is recognisable by some unambiguous automaton is open. Moreover, there are no known upper bounds on the descriptive complexity of unambiguous languages among all regular tree languages.   In this paper we show the following complexity collapse: if a non-deterministic parity tree automaton $A$ is unambiguous and its priorities are between $i$ and $2n$ then the language recognised by $A$ is in the class $Comp(i+1,2n)$. A particular case of this theorem is for $i=n=1$: if $A$ is an unambiguous Buchi tree automaton then $L(A)$ is recognisable by a weak alternating automaton (or equivalently definable in weak MSO). The main motivation for this result is a theorem by Finkel and Simonnet stating that every unambiguous Buchi automaton recognises a Borel language.   The assumptions of the presented theorem are syntactic (we require one automaton to be both unambiguous and of particular parity index). However, to the authors' best knowledge this is the first theorem showing a collapse of the parity index that exploits the fact that a given automaton is unambiguous."

This was demon- strated by the 33 MJ muzzle energy shot performed in 2010 in the framework of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) electromag- netic railgun program. Since then, railguns are a prime candidate for future long range artillery systems. In this scenario, a heavy projectile (several kilograms) is accelerated to approx. 2.5 km/s muzzle velocity. While the primary interest for such a hypersonic projectile is the bombardment of targets being hundreds of kilometers away, they can also be used to counter airplane attacks or in other direct fire scenarios. In these cases, the large initial velocity significantly reduces the time to impact the target. In this study we investigate a scenario, where a future shipboard railgun installation delivers the same kinetic energy to a target as the explosive round of a contemporary European ship artillery system. At the same time the railgun outperforms the current artillery systems in range. For this scenario a first draft for the parameters of a railgun system were derived. For the flight-path of the projectile, trajectories for different launch angles were simulated and the aero-thermodynamic heating was estimated using engineering-tools developed within the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This enables the assessment of the feasibility of the different strike scenarios, as well as the identification of the limits of the technology.

Searching for a narrow power spectrum peak resulting from a periodic modulation over the frequency range in which ``coloured'' noise components are dominant has proven a very complex task. We develop here a technique aimed at detecting periodicities in the presence of ``coloured'' power spectrum components, while mantaining the highest Fourier frequency resolution. First we introduce a simple approximation to the statistical properties of the ``coloured'' power spectra from celestial objects, based on a few examples and the theory of linear processes. We then estimate the continuum components in the power spectrum through an ad hoc smoothing technique. By dividing the sample spectrum by the smoothed one, a white-noise like spectrum is obtained, the approximate probability distribution of which is derived. A search for coherent pulsations is then carried out by looking for peaks in the divided spectrum, the chance probability of which is below a given detection threshold. The technique is tested and its range of applicability determined through extensive numerical simulations. We present also an application to the X-ray light curves of V0332+53, a highly variable accreting X-ray pulsar, and GX13+1, a bright and variable accreting source in the galactic bulge."

        "Abstract": "As a planet transits the face of a star, it accelerates along the line-of-sight. The changing delay in the propagation of photons produces an apparent deceleration of the planet across the sky throughout the transit. This persistent transverse deceleration breaks the time-reversal symmetry in the transit lightcurve of a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a perfectly symmetric star. For `hot Jupiter' systems, ingress advances at a higher rate than egress by a fraction of 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. Forthcoming space telescopes such as Kepler or COROT will reach the sensitivity required to detect this asymmetry. The scaling of the fractional asymmetry with stellar mass M and planetary orbital radius R as M/R^2 is different from the scaling of the orbital period as (M/R^3)^{-1/2}. Therefore, this effect constitutes a new method for a purely dynamical determination of the mass of the star, which is currently inferred indirectly with theoretical uncertainties based on spectral modeling. Radial velocity data for the reflex motion of the star can then be used to determine the planet's mass. Although orbital eccentricity could introduce a larger asymmetry than the light propagation delay, the eccentricity is expected to decay by tidal dissipation to negligible values for a close-in planet with no perturbing third body. Future detection of the eclipse of a planet's emission by its star could be used to measure the light propagation delay across the orbital diameter, 46.7(R/7x10^{11}cm) seconds, and also determine the stellar mass from the orbital period."

We start with a description of the second magnitude homology of a general metric space in terms of the zeroth homology groups of certain simplicial complexes. Then, on a geodesic metric space, we interpret the description by means of geodesics. The third magnitude homology of a geodesic metric space also admits a description in terms of a simplicial complex. Under an assumption on a metric space, the simplicial description allows us to introduce an invariant of third magnitude homology classes as an intersection number. Finally, we provide a complete description of all the magnitude homology groups of a geodesic metric space which fulfils a certain non-branching assumption."

        "Abstract": "We report the results of a 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation carried out to study the early-stage evolution of the shock formed when an unmagnetized relativistic jet interacts with an ambient electron-ion plasma. Full-shock structures associated with the interaction are observed in the ambient frame. When open boundaries are employed in the direction of the jet; the forward shock is seen as a hybrid structure consisting of an electrostatic shock combined with a double layer, while the reverse shock is seen as a double layer. The ambient ions show two distinct features across the forward shock: a population penetrating into the shocked region from the precursor region and an accelerated population escaping from the shocked region into the precursor region. This behavior is a signature of a combination of an electrostatic shock and a double layer. Jet electrons are seen to be electrostatically trapped between the forward and reverse shock structures showing a ring-like distribution in a phase-space plot, while ambient electrons are thermalized and become essentially isotropic in the shocked region. The magnetic energy density grows to a few percent of the jet kinetic energy density at both the forward and the reverse shock transition layers in a rather short time scale. We see little disturbance of the jet ions over this time scale."

The majority of these velocities have relative errors of $\\sim$1 km/s, or a factor of $\\sim$30-100 smaller than those previously obtained with proper motion or other radial velocity measurements for a similar stellar sample. The error in a typical individual stellar velocity, including all sources of uncertainty, is 1.7 km/s. Two similar data sets were obtained one month apart, and the total error in the relative velocities is 0.80 km/s\\ in the case where an object is common to both data sets. The data are used to characterize the velocity distribution of the old population in the Galctic Center. We find that the stars have a Gaussian velocity distribution with a mean heliocentric velocity of $-10.1\\pm$11.0 km/s (blueshifted) and a standard deviation of 100.9$\\pm7.7$ km/s; the mean velocity of the sample is consistent with no bulk line-of-sight motion with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. At the 1 sigma level, the data are consistent with a symmetric velocity distribution about any arbitrary axis in the plane of the sky. We find evidence for a flattening in the distribution of late-type stars within a radius of $\\sim$0.4 \\pc, and infer a volume density distribution of r$^{-1/4}$ in this region. Finally, we establish a first epoch of radial velocity measurements which can be compared to subsequent epochs to measure small accelerations (1 km/s/yr), corresponding to the magnitude expected over a timespan of several years for stars nearest to Sgr A*."

By means of a multiple-scale reduction of the Lugiato-Lefever equation with high order dispersion, we show that the dynamics of this optical device, when operating close to the critical point associated with bistability, is captured by a real order parameter equation in the form of a generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation. A Swift-Hohenberg equation has been derived for several areas of nonlinear science such as chemistry, biology, ecology, optics, and laser physics. However, the peculiarity of the obtained generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation for photonic crystal fiber resonators is that it possesses a third-order dispersion. Based on a weakly nonlinear analysis in the vicinity of the modulational instability threshold, we characterize the motion of dissipative structures by estimating their propagation speed. Finally, we numerically investigate the formation of moving temporal localized structures often called cavity solitons."

The MP has been predicted by QCD for the temperatures around the critical temperature Tc and could be formed as a result of nucleon percolation in the density nuclear matter. Our main goal is to get a new experimental confirmation of the percolation cluster formation as an accompanying effect of the MP formation. To reach the goal, the experimental data on Kr+Em - reaction at 0.95 GeV/nuc and Au+Em - reaction at 10.6 GeV/nucl. with a number of target fragments N_h > 8, have been analyzed. The behavior of the distributions of the target and the projectile fragments has been studied. The experimental data have been compared of the data coming from the cascade-evaporation model. We can conclude that: -- the centrality of the collision could be defined as a number of the target g-fragments in Kr+Em reactions at energies 0.95 A GeV/nucl and as a number of projectile F-fragments with Z>=1 in Au + Em reactions at energies 10.6 A GeV/nucl; -- the formation of the percolation cluster sufficiently influences the characteristics of nuclear fragments; -- there are points of the regime changes in the behavior of some characteristics of $s$-particles as a function of centrality which could be qualitatively understood as a result of the big percolation cluster formation."

The advantage of the present procedure over the ones using a deformed Woods Saxon or Nilsson single particle basis is that the actual pnQRPA states have a definite angular momentum while all the others provide states having only K as a good quantum number. The model Hamiltonian involves a mean field term yielding the projected single particle states, a pairing interaction for alike nucleons and a dipole-dipole proton-neutron interaction in both the particle-hole (ph) and particle-particle (pp) channels. The effect of nuclear deformation on the single beta strength distribution as well as on the double beta Gamow-Teller transition amplitude (M$_{{\\rm GT}}$) is analyzed.

These conditions show how to construct approximate factor models for such a SLLN to hold and that a PCS is almost sufficient and necessary for this purpose. The validity of the SLLN implies that the false discovery proportion (FDP) of the conditional procedure eventually is the same as its expectation almost surely.

        "Abstract": "A single atom in a cavity is the model system of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). The strong coupling regime between the atom and cavity-confined photon corresponds to the reversible exchange of energy between the two modes, and underpins a wide range of CQED phenomena with applications in quantum information science, including for example as quantum logic gates and as sources of entangled states. An important advance was achieved recently when strong coupling between excitons and cavity photons was reported for the first time for localized quantum dots (QDs) in micron-size solid state cavities. This has significance in terms of scalability and integration with other optical devices, and could lead to the emergence of \"quantum optics on a chip\" technology. However the results presented so far for quantum dots are in the linear regime, corresponding to coupling to the vacuum field (vacuum Rabi splitting); they are not a true QED effect and can equally well be described by classical physics as the coupling between two oscillators. In this paper, we present evidence for a purely quantum phenomenon for the QD/cavity photon system, namely the increase in splitting of the levels when the mean number of photons in the cavity is increased. This corresponds to non-linearities on the single-photon scale: the presence of a single excitation in the cavity changes the level structure, affecting the emission energies for a second photon. Such results are a first step in demonstrating the promise of quantum dots for CQED applications."

In this paper, we propose convolutional Poisson factor analysis (CPFA) that directly operates on a lossless representation that processes the words in each document as a sequence of high-dimensional one-hot vectors. To boost its performance, we further propose the convolutional Poisson gamma belief network (CPGBN) that couples CPFA with the gamma belief network via a novel probabilistic pooling layer. CPFA forms words into phrases and captures very specific phrase-level topics, and CPGBN further builds a hierarchy of increasingly more general phrase-level topics. For efficient inference, we develop both a Gibbs sampler and a Weibull distribution based convolutional variational auto-encoder. Experimental results demonstrate that CPGBN can extract high-quality text latent representations that capture the word order information, and hence can be leveraged as a building block to enrich a wide variety of existing latent variable models that ignore word order."

        "Abstract": "A constitutive model is developed for the mechanical response of elastomers at finite strains. A polymer is treated as a network of linear chains linked by permanent (chemical crosslinks) and temporary (entanglements and van der Waals forces) junctions. Temporary junctions are assumed to be in two states: loose (passive) when they impose only topological constrains on available configurations of chains, and tight (active) when their effect is tantamount to that for crosslinks. Stretching of a specimen implies that some loose junctions become active, which decreases the average length of a chain.   A long chain is treated as an ensemble of inextensible strands connected in sequel. Two neighboring strands are bridged by a bond which may be in two conformations: flexed (trans) and extended (cis). A bond in the flexed conformation is modeled as a linear elastic solid, whereas the mechanical energy of a bond in the extended conformation (two rigid rods directed along a straight line) is disregarded. For a virgin specimen, all bonds are in the flexed conformation. Under loading some bonds are transformed from flexed to extended conformation.   Stress-strain relations for a rubbery polymer and kinetic equations for the trans-cis transition are derived using the laws of thermodynamics. Governing equations are determined by 5 adjustable parameters which are found by fitting experimental data in uniaxial tensile tests on natural rubber vulcanizates with various amounts of crosslinks. Fair agreement is demonstrated between results of numerical simulation and observations with the elongation ratio up to $k=8$. We analyze the effects of cyclic loading, thermal annealing and recovery by swelling on the material constants."

Two-particle spectroscopic factors derived from Monte Carlo Shell Model calculations are used, together with the sequential description of the two-particle transfer reaction mechanism. The calculation shows a clear signature for a shape phase transition between $^{98}$Zr and $^{100}$Zr, which displays coexistence of a deformed ground state with an excited spherical $0^+$ state.

The broad-band continuum, obtained by combining XRT and IBIS data, is flat (Gamma ~ 1.3) with evidence for a spectral break around 25 keV (100 keV in the source rest frame). X-ray observations indicate flux variability which is further supported by a comparison with a previous ROSAT measurement. IGR J12319-0749 is also a radio emitting object likely characterized by a flat spectrum and high radio loudness; optically it is a broad-line emitting object with a massive black hole (2.8 x 10^{9}$ solar masses) at its center. The source Spectral Energy Distribution is similar to another high redshift blazar, 225155+2217 at z=3.668: both objects are bright, with a large accretion disk luminosity and a Compton peak located in the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray band.

HadaNets introduce a flexible train-from-scratch tensor quantization scheme by pairing a full precision tensor to a binary tensor in the form of a Hadamard product. Unlike wider reduced precision neural network models, we preserve the train-time parameter count, thus out-performing XNOR-Nets without a train-time memory penalty. Such training routines could see great utility in semi-supervised online learning tasks. Our method also offers advantages in model compression, as we reduce the model size of ResNet-18 by 7.43 times with respect to a full precision model without utilizing any other compression techniques. We also demonstrate a 'Hadamard Binary Matrix Multiply' kernel, which delivers a 10-fold increase in performance over full precision matrix multiplication with a similarly optimized kernel."

Efficient resource utilization is an important design aspect in such processors. Depending on the workload, mis-speculated execution can severely impact resource utilization and power utilization. In general, compared to a uniprocessor, a multithreaded processor may have better tolerance towards mis-speculation. However there can still be phases where even a multi-threaded processor performance may get impacted by branch induced mis-speculation. In this paper I propose monitoring the branch predictor behavior of various hardware threads running on the multi-threaded processor and use that information as a feedback to the thread arbiter/picker which schedules the next thread to fetch instructions from. If I find that a particular thread is going through a phase where it is consistently mis-predicting its branches and its average branch misprediction stall is above a specific threshold then I temporarily reduce the priority for picking that thread. I do a qualitative comparison of various solutions to the problem of resource inefficiency caused due to mis-speculated branches in multithreaded processors. This work can be extended by doing a quantitative evaluation."

        "Abstract": "A new gauge theory of gravity is presented. The theory is constructed in a flat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations between physical quantities are independent of the positions and orientations of the matter fields. In this manner all properties of the background spacetime are removed from physics, and what remains are a set of `intrinsic' relations between physical fields. The properties of the gravitational gauge fields are derived from both classical and quantum viewpoints. Field equations are then derived from an action principle, and consistency with the minimal coupling procedure selects an action that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant. This in turn singles out a unique form of spin-torsion interaction. A new method for solving the field equations is outlined and applied to the case of a time-dependent, spherically-symmetric perfect fluid. A gauge is found which reduces the physics to a set of essentially Newtonian equations. These equations are then applied to the study of cosmology, and to the formation and properties of black holes. The existence of global solutions enables one to discuss the properties of field lines inside the horizon due to a point charge held outside it. The Dirac equation is studied in a black hole background and provides a quick derivation of the Hawking temperature."

A lower Tc part is then defined within the bridge by irradiating with a much lower dose through a 20 nm wide narrow slit opened in a standard electronic photoresist. These planar junctions, whose settings can be finely tuned, exhibit reproducible and nearly ideal Josephson characteristics. Non hysteretic Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) like behavior is observed, together with sinc Fraunhofer patterns for rectangular junctions. The IcRn product varies with temperature ; it can reach a few mV. The typical resistance ranges from 0.1 to a few ohms, and the critical current density can be as high as 30 kA/cm2. The dispersion in characteristics is very low, in the 5% to 10% range. Such nanojunctions have been used to make microSQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) operating at Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) temperature.

The motivation comes from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories of space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when the topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different topos. In this paper we discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, S. The first is a propositional language, PL(S); the second is a higher-order, typed language L(S). Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. The reason for introducing PL(S) is that, as shown in paper II of the series, it is the easiest way of understanding, and expanding on, the earlier work on topos theory and quantum physics. However, the main thrust of our programme utilises the more powerful language L(S) and its representation in an appropriate topos."

Radio emission from eight massive stars is used as a tool for registration between the radio and infrared frames with mas precision within a few arcseconds of Sgr A*.

Stimulated Brillouin scattering, which was recently demonstrated in silicon, is a particularly powerful approach to induce a phase shift due to its inherent flexibility, offering an optically controllable and selective phase shift. However, to date, only moderate amounts of Brillouin gain has been achieved and theoretically this would restrict the phase shift to a few tens of degrees, significantly less than the required 360 degrees. Here, we overcome this limitation with a phase enhancement method using RF interference, showing a 360 degrees broadband phase shifter based on Brillouin scattering in a suspended silicon waveguide. We achieve a full 360 degrees phase-shift over a bandwidth of 15 GHz using a phase enhancement factor of 25, thereby enabling practical broadband Brillouin phase shifter for beam forming and other applications."

The propagation of electromagnetic waves is well modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE): a Helmholtz equation. A natural way to solve the MABL characterization inverse problem is to minimize what is observed and what is predicted by the PDE. However, this optimization is difficult because it has many local minima. We propose an alternative solution that relies on the properties of the PDE but does not involve solving the full forward model. Ducted environments result in an EM field which can be decomposed into a few propagating, trapped modes. These modes are a subset of the solutions to a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem. We design a new objective function that measures the distance from the observations to a subspace spanned by these eigenvectors. The resulting optimization problem is much easier than the one that arises in the standard approach, and we show how to solve the associated nonlinear eigenvalue problem efficiently, leading to a real-time method."

We review the theory of Bayesian experimental design and propose an estimator for the expected utility of a design.

This model fits the entire spectrum self-consistently. The unique feature of the model is that the flow is advection-dominated, i.e. most of the energy viscously dissipated in the differentially rotating flow is carried along with the gas and lost through the horizon. The apparent success of this model in explaining the data may be considered ``proof'' that horizons are real and that a massive black hole does exist at the Galactic center."

        "Title": "Algorithms for Discrete Denoising Under Channel Uncertainty",
        "Abstract": "The goal of a denoising algorithm is to reconstruct a signal from its noise-corrupted observations. Perfect reconstruction is seldom possible and performance is measured under a given fidelity criterion. In a recent work, the authors addressed the problem of denoising unknown discrete signals corrupted by a discrete memoryless channel when the channel, rather than being completely known, is only known to lie in some uncertainty set of possible channels. A sequence of denoisers was derived for this case and shown to be asymptotically optimal with respect to a worst-case criterion argued most relevant to this setting. In the present work we address the implementation and complexity of this denoiser for channels parametrized by a scalar, establishing its practicality. We show that for symmetric channels, the problem can be mapped into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. We also present empirical results suggesting the potential of these schemes to do well in practice. A key component of our schemes is an estimator of the subset of channels in the uncertainty set that are feasible in the sense of being able to give rise to the noise-corrupted signal statistics for some channel input distribution. We establish the efficiency of this estimator, both algorithmically and experimentally. We also present a modification of the recently developed discrete universal denoiser (DUDE) that assumes a channel based on the said estimator, and show that, in practice, the resulting scheme performs well. For concreteness, we focus on the binary alphabet case and binary symmetric channels, but also discuss the extensions of the algorithms to general finite alphabets and to general channels parameterized by a scalar."

        "Title": "Symmetry and the salience of textures",
        "Abstract": "In this paper we investigate the role of symmetry in visual stimuli designed to probe human sensitivity to image statistics. Our starting point is a recently published parameter space, a point in which defines a family of binary texture images displaying a prescribed content of \\nth{1}- to \\nth{4}-order correlations among pixels in 2x2 patches. We show that this parameter space can be represented by fewer variables, namely the \\emph{orbit invariants} obtained by exploiting texture symmetry. Next we show how a class of locally countable texture statistics, the Minkowski functionals -- recently shown to be a proxy for human performance in texture discrimination tasks - can be written as a linear combination of the dihedral orbit invariants. Furthermore, by recasting these functionals as a combination of dihedral invariants, a generalization of these functionals can be obtained for textures of any number of grey-levels, patch sizes, or lattice types -- greatly reducing the number of dimensions/parameters needed to characterize the generated images. Orbit invariants may therefore provide a clue on the discrimination of these richer textures, as the ordinary Minkowski functionals do for binary textures."

        "Abstract": "Electrophoretic separation of a mixture of chemical species is a fundamental technique of great usefulness in biology, health care and forensics. In capillary electrophoresis the sample migrates in a microcapillary in the presence of a background electrolyte. When the ionic concentration of the sample is sufficiently high, the signal is known to exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear waves including sharp concentration `shocks'.In this paper we consider a simplified model consisting of a single sample ion and a background electrolyte consisting of a single co-ion and a counterion in the absence of any processes that might change the ionization states of the constituents. If the ionic diffusivities are assumed to be the same for all constituents the concentration of sample ion is shown to obey a one dimensional advection diffusion equation with a concentration dependent advection velocity.If the analyte concentration is sufficiently low in a suitable non-dimensional sense, Burgers' equation is recovered, and thus, the time dependent problem is exactly solvable with arbitrary initial conditions. In the case of small diffusivity either a leading edge or trailing edge shock is formed depending on the electrophoretic mobility of the sample ion relative to the background ions. Analytical formulas are presented for the shape, width and migration velocity of the sample peak and it is shown that axial dispersion at long times may be characterized by an effective diffusivity that is exactly calculated. These results are consistent with known observations from physical and numerical simulation experiments."

        "Abstract": "We present the results of a 2-10 keV BeppoSAX survey based on 140 high galactic latitude MECS fields, 12 of which are deep exposures of ``blank'' parts of the sky. The limiting sensitivity is 5 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 where about 25% of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) is resolved into discrete sources. The logN-logS function, built with a statistically complete sample of 177 sources, is steep and in good agreement with the counts derived from ASCA surveys. A CXB fluctuation analysis allowed us to probe the logN-logS down to about 1.5 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 where the contribution of discrete sources to the CXB grows to 40-50%. A hardness ratio analysis reveals the presence of a wide range of spectral shapes and that a fairly large fraction of sources appear to be heavily absorbed, some of which showing soft components. A comparison of the flux distribution of different subsamples confirms the existence of a spectral hardening with decreasing flux. This effect is probably due to an increasing percentage of absorbed sources at faint fluxes, rather than to a gradual flattening of the spectral slope. Nearly all the sources for which adequate ROSAT exposures exist, have been detected in the soft X-rays. This confirms that soft spectral components are present even in strongly absorbed objects, and that a large population of sources undetectable below a few keV does not exist. A Ve/Va test provides evidence for the presence of cosmological evolution of a magnitude similar to that found in soft X-ray extragalactic sources. Evolution is present both in normal and absorbed sources, with the latter population possibly evolving faster,although this effect could also be the result of complex selection effects."

        "Abstract": "It is well known that massive black holes may form through the gravitational collapse of a massive astrophysical body. Less known is the fact that a black hole can be produced by the quantum process of pair creation in external fields. These black holes may have a mass much lower than their astrophysical counterparts. This mass can be of the order of Planck mass so that quantum effects may be important. This pair creation process can be investigated semiclassically using non-perturbative instanton methods, thus it may be used as a theoretical laboratory to obtain clues for a quantum gravity theory. In this work, we review briefly the history of pair creation of particles and black holes in external fields. In order to present some features of the euclidean instanton method which is used to calculate pair creation rates, we study a simple model of a scalar field and propose an effective one-loop action for a two-dimensional soliton pair creation problem. This action is built from the soliton field itself and the soliton charge is no longer treated as a topological charge but as a Noether charge. The results are also valid straightforwardly to the problem of pair creation rate of domain walls in dimensions greater than 2."

The proposed SRFD algorithm classifies the bang-bang phase detector(BBPD) outputs to estimate the current phase state, and detects the frequency mismatch between the input data and the sampling clock. The VCO-track path in a digital loop filter (DLF) enables online calibration of a drifted frequency of VCO caused by temperature or voltage variation after a frequency acquisition. The proposed algorithm can be implemented as a digitally-synthesized circuit, lowering design efforts for referenceless CDRs. A 10 Gbps transceiver IC with the proposed algorithm, fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process, demonstrates successful recovery of the input phase without any reference clock."

        "Abstract": "A Markov tree is a random vector indexed by the nodes of a tree whose distribution is determined by the distributions of pairs of neighbouring variables and a list of conditional independence relations. Upon an assumption on the tails of the Markov kernels associated to these pairs, the conditional distribution of the self-normalized random vector when the variable at the root of the tree tends to infinity converges weakly to a random vector of coupled random walks called tail tree. If, in addition, the conditioning variable has a regularly varying tail, the Markov tree satisfies a form of one-component regular variation. Changing the location of the root, that is, changing the conditioning variable, yields a different tail tree. When the tails of the marginal distributions of the conditioning variables are balanced, these tail trees are connected by a formula that generalizes the time change formula for regularly varying stationary time series. The formula is most easily understood when the various one-component regular variation statements are tied up to a single multi-component statement. The theory of multi-component regular variation is worked out for general random vectors, not necessarily Markov trees, with an eye towards other models, graphical or otherwise."

The mean IMF multiplicities (for the events with at least one IMF) are saturating at the value of $2.2\\pm0.2$ for the incident energies above 6 GeV. The observed IMF multiplicities cannot be described in a two-stage scenario, a fast cascade followed by a statistical multifragmentation. Agreement with the measured IMF multiplicities is obtained by introducing an intermediate phase and modifying empirically the excitation energies and masses of the remnants.   The angular distributions and energy spectra from the p-induced collisions are in agreement with the scenario of ``thermal'' multifragmentation of a hot and diluted target spectator. In the case of $^{12}$C+Au(22.4 GeV) and $^4$He(14.6 GeV)+Au collisions, deviations from a pure thermal break-up are seen in the energy spectra of the emitted fragments, which are harder than those both from model calculations and from the measured ones for p-induced collisions.

Then, we present a more detailed development of one example of such a network constructed from a combination of mathematically derived models of receptive fields and biologically inspired computations. Based on a functional model of complex cells in terms of an oriented quasi quadrature combination of first- and second-order directional Gaussian derivatives, we couple such primitive computations in cascade over combinatorial expansions over image orientations. Scale-space properties of the computational primitives are analysed and we give explicit proofs of how the resulting representation allows for scale and rotation covariance. A prototype application to texture analysis is developed and it is demonstrated that a simplified mean-reduced representation of the resulting QuasiQuadNet leads to promising experimental results on three texture datasets."

We confirm the soft excess in both sources, even if for Mrk~841 a warm absorber provides a fit almost as good as the one with a true excess. As far as the hard X-ray continuum is concerned, a Comptonization model provides a fit as good as a power law and a physically sound solution for Mrk841. For Mrk335, the Comptonization model gives a result which is somewhat better on statistical ground, but rather problematic on physical ground. The most interesting results regard the reprocessing components. For Mrk841 we find a very large reflection continuum but an almost normal iron line equivalent width even if, within the errors, a solution in which both components are a factor ~2 larger than expected for an accretion disc is still marginally acceptable. If this is the case, an anisotropy of the primary emission seems the best explanation. On the contrary, in Mrk335 we find a very large iron line EW but a reflection component not accordingly large. In this case, the best solution seems to be in terms of reflection from an ionized disc."

The ubiquity of algebraic structures in mathematics and related fields has given rise to several variants of universal algebra, such as theories of symmetric operads, non-symmetric operads, generalised operads, PROPs, PROs, and monads. These variants of universal algebra are called notions of algebraic theory. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for them. The key observation is that each notion of algebraic theory can be identified with a monoidal category, in such a way that algebraic theories correspond to monoid objects therein. To incorporate semantics, we introduce a categorical structure called metamodel, which formalises a definition of models of algebraic theories. We also define morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal version of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint pair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform method to establish isomorphisms between categories of models in different notions of algebraic theory. A general structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical universal property of categories of models are also shown."

This method is generalized to predict P(I)'s of more complicated cases, such as even or odd number of fermions in a large single-j shell or a many-j shell, d-boson, sd-boson or sdg-boson systems, etc. By this method we are able to tell which interactions are essential to produce a sizable P(I) in a many-body system. The g.s. probability of maximum angular momentum $I_{max}$ is discussed. An argument on the microscopic foundation of our approach, and certain matrix elements which are useful to understand the observed regularities, are also given or addressed in detail.

All the previously known formulas follow as an immediate corollary or easy exercise, thus giving a bijective proof for each of them, in a unified way. For some of these formulas, this is the first bijective proof, e.g. the Harer-Zagier recurrence formula, the Lehman-Walsh formula and the Goupil-Schaeffer formula. We also discuss several applications of our construction: we obtain a new proof of an identity related to covered maps due to Bernardi and the first author, and thanks to previous work of the second author, we give a new expression for Stanley character polynomials, which evaluate irreducible characters of the symmetric group. Finally, we show that our techniques apply partially to unicellular 3-constellations and to related objects that we call quasi-constellations."

        "Abstract": "We report the detection with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer of a Compton reflection signature in the Seyfert galaxy MCG-5-23-16. RXTE also resolves the Fe K-alpha fluorescence line with FWHM ~48,000 km s^{-1}. This measurement provides the first independent confirmation of ASCA detections in Seyfert galaxies of broad Fe K-alpha lines that are thought to be the signature of emission from the inner regions of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole. Under the assumption that reflection arises from an isotropic source located above a neutral accretion disk, and using a theoretical model that accounts for the dependence of the reflected spectrum on inclination angle, we derive a 90% confidence range for the disk inclination of i = 50 to 81 degrees. The large inclination is consistent with that expected from the unified model for MCG-5-23-16 based on its Seyfert 1.9 classification. If we assume that the high-energy cutoff in the incident spectrum lies at energies larger than a few hundred keV, then the equivalent width of the Fe K-alpha line is much larger than predicted for the amount of reflection. This implies either an enhanced iron abundance, a covering factor of reflecting material > 0.5, or a cutoff in the incident spectrum at energies between ~60 and ~200 keV."

We begin with a broad overview of this class of driven diffusive systems - which includes exclusion processes - focusing on interesting physical properties, such as shocks and phase transitions. We then turn our attention specifically to those models for which the exact distribution of microstates in the steady state can be expressed in a matrix product form. In addition to a gentle introduction to this matrix product approach, how it works and how it relates to similar constructions that arise in other physical contexts, we present a unified, pedagogical account of the various means by which the statistical mechanical calculations of macroscopic physical quantities are actually performed. We also review a number of more advanced topics, including nonequilibrium free energy functionals, the classification of exclusion processes involving multiple particle species, existence proofs of a matrix product state for a given model and more complicated variants of the matrix product state that allow various types of parallel dynamics to be handled. We conclude with a brief discussion of open problems for future research."

        "Abstract": "A mathematical characterization of serially-pruned permutations (SPPs) employed in variable-length permuters and their associated fast pruning algorithms and architectures are proposed. Permuters are used in many signal processing systems for shuffling data and in communication systems as an adjunct to coding for error correction. Typically only a small set of discrete permuter lengths are supported. Serial pruning is a simple technique to alter the length of a permutation to support a wider range of lengths, but results in a serial processing bottleneck. In this paper, parallelizing SPPs is formulated in terms of recursively computing sums involving integer floor and related functions using integer operations, in a fashion analogous to evaluating Dedekind sums. A mathematical treatment for bit-reversal permutations (BRPs) is presented, and closed-form expressions for BRP statistics are derived. It is shown that BRP sequences have weak correlation properties. A new statistic called permutation inliers that characterizes the pruning gap of pruned interleavers is proposed. Using this statistic, a recursive algorithm that computes the minimum inliers count of a pruned BR interleaver (PBRI) in logarithmic time complexity is presented. This algorithm enables parallelizing a serial PBRI algorithm by any desired parallelism factor by computing the pruning gap in lookahead rather than a serial fashion, resulting in significant reduction in interleaving latency and memory overhead. Extensions to 2-D block and stream interleavers, as well as applications to pruned fast Fourier transforms and LTE turbo interleavers, are also presented. Moreover, hardware-efficient architectures for the proposed algorithms are developed. Simulation results demonstrate 3 to 4 orders of magnitude improvement in interleaving time compared to existing approaches."

In this paper we demonstrate that in a tree T, of order n greater than 1, any stable set of size greater or equal to n/2 contains at least one pendant vertex. Hence, we deduce that any maximum stable set in a tree contains at least one pendant vertex. Our main finding is the theorem claiming that if T does not own a perfect matching, then at least two pendant vertices an even distance apart belong to core(T). While it is proved by Levit and Mandrescu that if G is a connected bipartite graph of order at least 2, then the size of core(G) is different from 1, our new statement reveals an additional structure of the intersection of all maximum stable sets of a tree. The above assertions give refining of one result of Hammer, Hansen and Simeone, stating that if a graph G is of order less than 2*alpha(G), then core(G) is non-empty, and also of a result of Jamison, Gunter, Hartnel and Rall, and Zito, saying that for a tree T of order at least two, the size of core(G) is different from 1."

In each run of the experiment, there is a trapping stage of duration $\\tau$. After the trapping stage, protons are purged from the trap. A proton detector provides incomplete information because it goes dead after detecting the first of any purged protons. Further, there is a dead time $\\delta$ between the end of the trapping stage in one run and the beginning of the next trapping stage in the next run. Based on the fraction of runs where a proton is detected, I estimate the trapping rate $\\lambda$ by the method of maximum likelihood. I show that the expected value of the maximum likelihood estimate is infinite. To obtain a maximum likelihood estimate with a finite expected value and a well-defined and finite variance, I restrict attention to a subsample of all realizations of the data. This subsample excludes an exceedingly rare realization that yields an infinite-valued estimate of $\\lambda$. I present asymptotically valid formulas for the bias, root-mean-square prediction error, and standard deviation of the maximum likelihood estimate of $\\lambda$ for this subsample. Based on nominal values of $\\lambda$ and the dead time $\\delta$, I determine the optimal duration of the trapping stage $\\tau$ by minimizing the root-mean-square prediction error of the estimate."

The generalized recurrence is valid for connected Feynman diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and an arbitrary order. The recurrence formula terms are expressed in function of weak compositions of non-negative integers and partitions of positive integers in such a way that to each term of the recurrence correspond a partition and a weak composition. The foundation of this enumeration is the Wick theorem, permitting an easy generalization to any quantum field theory. The iterative enumeration is constructive and enables a fast computation of the number of connected Feynman diagrams for a large amount of cases. In particular, the recurrence is solved exactly for two and four external legs, leading to the asymptotic expansion of the number of different connected Feynman diagrams."

(There is also a definition for the nonunital case.) T. Quinn has recently shown that a unital AF algebra has the APFP if and only if it has no finite dimensional quotients. This paper is a more systematic investigation of C*-algebras with the APFP. We prove various properties of such algebras. For example: They have connected invertible group, trivial K_1, and stable rank 1. In the unital case, the K_0 group separates the tracial states. The APFP passes to matrix algebras. and if I is an ideal in A such that I and A/I have the APFP, then so does A. We also give some new examples of C*-algebras with the APFP, including type II_1 factors and infinite-dimensional simple unital direct limits with slow dimension growth, real rank zero, and trivial K_1 group. An infinite- dimensional simple unital direct limit with slow dimension growth and with the APFP must have real rank zero, but we also give examples of unital algebras with the APFP which do not have real rank zero.   Our analysis also leads to the introduction of a new concept of rank for a C*-algebra that may be of interest in the future."

Addition of salt is treated implicitly through a screened Coulomb potential for the electrostatic interactions.   For the flexible model the electrostatic persistence length shows roughly three regimes in its dependence on the Debye-H\\\"{u}ckel screening length, $\\kappa^{-1}$.As long as the salt content is low and $\\kappa^{-1}$ is longer than the end-to-end distance, the electrostatic persistence length varies only slowly with $\\kappa^{-1}$. Decreasing the screening length, a controversial region is entered. We find that the electrostatic persistence length scales as $sqrt{\\xi_p}/\\kappa$, in agreement with experiment on flexible polyelectrolytes, where $\\xi_p$ is a strength parameter measuring the electrostatic interactions within the polyelectrolyte. For screening lengths much shorter than the bond length, the $\\kappa^{-1}$ dependence becomes quadratic in the variational calculation. The simulations suffer from numerical problems in this regime, but seem to give a relationship half-way between linear and quadratic.   A low temperature expansion only reproduces the first regime and a high temperature expansion, which treats the electrostatic interactions as a perturbation to a Gaussian chain, gives a quadratic dependence on the Debye length.   For a sufficiently stiff chain, the persistence length varies quadratically with $\\kappa^{-1}$ in agreement with earlier theories."

However, in this literature, there has been no analytical expressions for the probability of decoding a fraction of source messages after transmission of some coded packets. In this work, we looked into the problem of the probability of decoding a fraction of source messages, i.e., partial decoding, in the decoder for a system which uses SNC. We exploited the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to derive expressions of partial decoding probability. The presented model predicts the probability of partial decoding with an average deviation of 6%. Our results show that SNC has a great potential for recovering a fraction of the source message, especially in higher sparsity and lower Galois Field size. Moreover, to achieve a better probability of partial decoding throughout transmissions, we define a sparsity tuning scheme that significantly increases the probability of partial decoding. Our results show that this tuning scheme achieves a 16% improvement in terms of probability of decoding a fraction of source packets with respect to traditional SNC."

One possible solution to this problem is to reconstruct the so-called exit wave, i.e. the electron wave in the microscope right before it passes the objective lens, from a series of TEM images acquired with varying focus. While the forward model of simulating a TEM image from a given exit wave is known and easy to evaluate, it is in general not possible to reconstruct the exit wave from a series of images analytically. The corresponding inverse problem can be formulated as a minimization problem, which is done in the well known MAL and MIMAP methods. We propose a generalization of the MAL algorithm by performing the exit wave reconstruction and the registration of the image series simultaneously. We show that our objective functional is not convex with respect to the exit wave, which also carries over to the MAL functional. The main result is the existence of minimizers of our objective functional. These results are based on the properties of a generalization of the cross-correlation. Finally, the applicability of our method is verified with a numerical experiment on simulated input data."

The proposed method is based on a decomposition of the solution into mean and a random field using a generic Karhunnen-Loeve expansion. The random field is represented as a convolution of separable Hilbert spaces in stochastic and spacial dimensions that are spectrally represented using respective orthogonal bases. In particular, the present paper investigates generalized polynomial chaos bases for stochastic dimension and eigenfunction bases for spacial dimension. Dynamic orthogonality is used to derive closed form equations for the time evolution of mean, spacial and the stochastic fields. The resultant system of equations consists of a partial differential equation (PDE) that define dynamic evolution of the mean, a set of PDEs to define the time evolution of eigenfunction bases, while a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) define dynamics of the stochastic field. This system of dynamic evolution equations efficiently propagates the prior parametric uncertainty to the system response. The resulting bi-orthogonal expansion of the system response is used to reformulate the Bayesian inference for efficient exploration of the posterior distribution. Efficacy of the proposed method is investigated for calibration of a 2D transient diffusion simulator with uncertain source location and diffusivity. Computational efficiency of the method is demonstrated against a Monte Carlo method and a generalized polynomial chaos approach."

        "Abstract": "The sudden reconnection of a non-force free 2D current layer, embedded in a low-beta plasma, triggered by the onset of an anomalous resistivity, is studied in detail. The resulting behaviour consists of two main phases. Firstly, a transient reconnection phase, in which the current in the layer is rapidly dispersed and some flux is reconnected. This dispersal of current launches a family of small amplitude magnetic and plasma perturbations, which propagate away from the null at the local fast and slow magnetosonic speeds. The vast majority of the magnetic energy released in this phase goes into internal energy of the plasma, and only a tiny amount is converted into kinetic energy. In the wake of the outwards propagating pulses, an imbalance of Lorentz and pressure forces creates a stagnation flow which drives a regime of impulsive bursty reconnection, in which fast reconnection is turned on and off in a turbulent manner as the current density exceeds and falls below a critical value. During this phase, the null current density is continuously built up above a certain critical level, then dissipated very rapidly, and built up again, in a stochastic manner. Interestingly, the magnetic energy converted during this quasi-steady phase is greater than that converted during the initial transient reconnection phase. Again essentially all the energy converted during this phase goes directly to internal energy. These results are of potential importance for solar flares and coronal heating, and set a conceptually important reference for future 3D studies."

The spectrum of this object can be described by a blackbody model with the temperature kT=404 eV and radius of the emitting region R=0.28 km, at a distance of 1 kpc. Power-law and thermal plasma models do not fit the source spectrum. The spectrum shows a marginally significant feature at 1.68 keV. Search for periodicity yields two candidate periods, about 301 ms and 33 ms, both significant at a 2.1 sigma level; the corresponding pulsed fractions are 13% and 9%, respectively. We find no evidence for long-term variability of the source flux, nor do we find extended emission around the central object.

It could be either a neutron star with a low or regular magnetic field, slowly accreting from a fossil disk, or, more likely, an isolated neutron star with a superstrong magnetic field.

In a canonical formulation the morphology and scaling behavior are accessed by mean of a principle of least action in the asymptotic non-perturbative weak noise limit. The ensuing coupled saddle point field equations for the local slope and noise fields, replacing the noisy Burgers equation, are solved yielding nonlinear localized soliton solutions and extended linear diffusive mode solutions, describing the morphology of a growing interface. The canonical formalism and the principle of least action also associate momentum, energy, and action with a soliton-diffusive mode configuration and thus provides a selection criterion for the noise-induced fluctuations. In a ``quantum mechanical'' representation of the path integral the noise fluctuations, corresponding to different paths in the path integral, are interpreted as ``quantum fluctuations'' and the growth morphology represented by a Landau-type quasi-particle gas of ``quantum solitons'' with gapless dispersion and ``quantum diffusive modes'' with a gap in the spectrum. Finally, the scaling properties are dicussed from a heuristic point of view in terms of a``quantum spectral representation'' for the slope correlations. The dynamic eponent z=3/2 is given by the gapless soliton dispersion law, whereas the roughness exponent zeta =1/2 follows from a regularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation. A heuristic expression for the scaling function is given by spectral representation and has a form similar to the probability distribution for Levy flights with index $z$."

        "Abstract": "Two-state models provide phenomenological descriptions of many different systems, ranging from physics to chemistry and biology. We investigate work fluctuations in an ensemble of two-state systems driven out of equilibrium under the action of an external perturbation. We calculate the probability density P(W) that a work equal to W is exerted upon the system along a given non-equilibrium trajectory and introduce a trajectory thermodynamics formalism to quantify work fluctuations in the large-size limit. We then define a trajectory entropy S(W) that counts the number of non-equilibrium trajectories P(W)=exp(S(W)/kT) with work equal to W. A trajectory free-energy F(W) can also be defined, which has a minimum at a value of the work that has to be efficiently sampled to quantitatively test the Jarzynski equality. Within this formalism a Lagrange multiplier is also introduced, the inverse of which plays the role of a trajectory temperature. Our solution for P(W) exactly satisfies the fluctuation theorem by Crooks and allows us to investigate heat-fluctuations for a protocol that is invariant under time reversal. The heat distribution is then characterized by a Gaussian component (describing small and frequent heat exchange events) and exponential tails (describing the statistics of large deviations and rare events). For the latter, the width of the exponential tails is related to the aforementioned trajectory temperature. Finite-size effects to the large-N theory and the recovery of work distributions for finite N are also discussed. Finally, we pay particular attention to the case of magnetic nanoparticle systems under the action of a magnetic field H where work and heat fluctuations are predicted to be observable in ramping experiments in micro-SQUIDs."

Employing a recently developed method of constructing the Hilbert space and observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we then obtain the probability current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ for the localization of a Klein-Gordon field in space. We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both $J_a^\\mu$ and ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the localization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike $J_a^\\mu$ the current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ is neither covariant nor conserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either of these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the total probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of $J_a^\\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge symmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if the parameter $a$ is rational.

In particular, the lattice deformations resulting in alternate stronger and weaker couplings along both the principal axes of a square lattice are shown to result in a larger gain in magnetic energy. In addition, a `columnar' configuration is shown to have a lower ground state energy and a faster increase in the energy gap parameter than a `staggered' configuration. The inclusion of unexpanded exchange coupling leads to a power law behaviour for the magnetic energy gain and energy gap, which is qualitatively different from that reported earlier. Instead of increasing as $\\delta ^{x}$, the two quantities depend on $\\delta $ as $\\delta ^{\\nu}/| \\ln \\delta | .$ This is true both in the near critical regime $(0\\leq \\delta \\leq 0.1)$ as well as in the far regime $(0\\leq \\delta <1)$.

        "Abstract": "A stratified pseudomanifold is normal if its links are connected. A normalization of a stratified pseudomanifold $X$ is a normal stratified pseudomanifold $Y$ together with a finite-to-one projection $n:Y\\to X$ satisfying a local condition related to the fibers. The map n preserves the intersection homology. Following Borel any pl-stratified pseudomanifod has a normalization in the above sense. In this parper: 1.- We prove that the map $n$ can be required to satisfy a stronger condition: it is a locally trivial stratified morphism preserving the conical structure transverse to the strata. 2.- We extend Borel's result for any topological stratified pseudomanifold and for a family of perversities which is larger than the usual one. 3.- We make an explicit construction of such a normalization. We give a detailed description of the normalizer's stratification. 4.- We prove that our construction is functorial, thus unique up to isomorphisms. With little adjust our procedure holds also in the $C^{\\infty}$ category."

        "Abstract": "A sample of nine bright Seyfert 1 and NELG type galaxies, observed with BeppoSAX, is analyzed to assess on a truly broad band basis (0.1-200 keV) the issue of the spectral contributions of Compton reflection and iron line fluorescence from circumnuclear gas. The empirical description adopted for the direct continuum is the commonly used power law with an exponential cut-off. The most direct test of the theoretical predictions, namely that the equivalent width of the line, Walpha, and the strength R of the reflection relative to the direct continuum are closely related to each other, gives a substantially positive result, that is their mean ratio is very close to expectation, and only a modest spread in the iron abundance seems implied. The existence of a steep correlation between R and the slope Gamma of the power law is not confirmed. A weak evidence is found that the existence of a very shallow trend to increase on average with Gamma cannot be altogether excluded in both R and Walpha, but needs to be tested with a larger sample. The energy Ef in the exponential cut-off spans a range from about 80 to more than 300 keV. A possible correlation is found, with Ef increasing on average with Gamma: if ignored, for instance by keeping Ef at a fixed value in a sample study, it could be cause of artificial steepening in a correlation between R and Gamma."

This topology is shown to have several good properties, such as replicating the manifold topology for a spacetime and replicating the expected topology for some simple examples of spacetime-with-boundary; it also allows for a complete categorical characterization, in topological categories, of the Future Causal Boundary construction of Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose, showing that construction to have a universal property for future-completing chronological sets with spacelike boundaries. Rigidity results are given for any reasonable future completion of a spacetime, in terms of the GKP boundary: In the imputed topology, any such boundary must be homeomorphic to the GKP boundary (if all points have indecomposable pasts) or to a topological quotient of a closely related boundary (if boundaries are spacelike). A large class of warped-product-type spacetimes with spacelike boundaries is examined, calculating the GKP and other possible boundaries, and showing that the imputed topology gives expected results; included among these are the Schwarzschild singularity and those Robertson-Walker singularities which are spacelike."

        "Title": "Black hole scalarisation from the breakdown of scale-invariance",
        "Abstract": "Electro-vacuum black holes are scale-invariant; their energy-momentum tensor is traceless. Quantum corrections of various sorts, however, can often produce a trace anomaly and a breakdown of scale-invariance. The (quantum-corrected) black hole solutions of the corresponding gravitational effective field theory (EFT) have a non-vanishing Ricci scalar. Then, the presence of a scalar field with the standard non-minimal coupling $\\xi \\phi^2 R$ naturally triggers a spontaneous scalarisation of the corresponding black holes. This scalarisation phenomenon occurs for an (infinite) discrete set of $\\xi$. We illustrate the occurrence of this phenomenon for two examples of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole solution of EFTs. In one example the trace anomaly comes from the matter sector -- a novel, closed form, generalisation of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution with an $F^4$ correction -- whereas in the other example it comes from the geometry sector -- a noncommutative geometry generalization of the Schwarzschild black hole. For comparison, we also consider the scalarisation of a black hole surrounded by (non-conformally invariant) classical matter (Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes). We find that the scalarised solutions are, generically, entropically favoured."

This paper studies clustered coloring, where the number of colors depends on an excluded complete bipartite subgraph. This is a much weaker assumption than previous works, where typically the number of colors depends on an excluded minor. This paper focuses on graph classes with bounded layered treewidth, which include planar graphs, graphs of bounded Euler genus, graphs embeddable on a fixed surface with a bounded number of crossings per edge, amongst other examples. Our main theorem says that for fixed integers $s,t,k$, every graph with layered treewidth at most $k$ and with no $K_{s,t}$ subgraph is $(s+2)$-colorable with bounded clustering. In the $s=1$ case, which corresponds to graphs of bounded maximum degree, we obtain polynomial bounds on the clustering. This greatly improves a corresponding result of Esperet and Joret for graphs of bounded genus. The $s=3$ case implies that every graph with a drawing on a fixed surface with a bounded number of crossings per edge is 5-colorable with bounded clustering. Our main theorem is also a critical component in two companion papers that study clustered coloring of graphs with no $K_{s,t}$-subgraph and excluding a fixed minor, odd minor or topological minor."

A relativistically-broadened iron line at ~6.4 keV is clearly resolved in the time-averaged spectrum, with an equivalent width of 310^{+70}_{-90} eV. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the heavily absorbed soft X-ray band confirms the existence of a variable, multi-zone warm absorber in this source, as proposed in a previous analysis of a shorter ASCA observation. The light curve of the source is wildly variable on timescales of hours or less, and a factor of nearly 10 change in count-rate was recorded in a period of less than 2000 s. The long observation and variability of the source allowed the power density spectrum (PDS) to be constructed to an unprecedented level of detail. There is evidence for a break in the PDS from a slope of \\alpha~1 to \\alpha~1.8 at a frequency of around 3 \\times 10^{-4} Hz. The central black hole mass of NGC 4395 is estimated to be approximately 10^4-10^5 solar masses using the break in the PDS, a result consistent with previous analyses using optical and kinematical techniques."

The approach is based on the 3D face model CANDIDE and on the SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors, extracted around a few given landmarks (26 selected vertices of CANDIDE model) with a Bayesian approach. The training phase is performed on a synthetic database generated from the first video frame. At each current frame, the face pose and animation parameters are estimated via a Bayesian approach, with a Gaussian prior and a Gaussian likelihood function whose the mean and the covariance matrix eigenvalues are updated from the previous frame using eigen decomposition. Numerical results on pose estimation and landmark locations are reported using the Boston University Face Tracking (BUFT) database and Talking Face video. They show that our approach, compared to six other published algorithms, provides a very good compromise and presents a promising perspective due to the good results in terms of landmark localization."

The model couples a Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman (CHB) system with a elliptic reaction-diffusion equation for a nutrient. The fluid velocity, governed by the Brinkman law, is not solenodial, as its divergence is a function of the nutrient and the phase field variable, i.e., solution-dependent, and frictionless boundary conditions are prescribed for the velocity to avoid imposing unrealistic constraints on the divergence relation. In this paper we give a first result on the existence of weak and stationary solutions to the CHB model with singular potentials, specifically the double obstacle potential and the logarithmic potential, which ensures the phase field variable stay in the physically relevant interval. New difficulties arise from the interplay between the singular potentials and the solution-dependent source terms, but can be overcome with several key estimates for the approximations of the singular potentials, which may be of independent interests. As a consequence, included in our analysis is a weak existence result for a Darcy variant, and our work serve to generalise recent results on weak and stationary solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard inpainting model with singular potentials."

This is done through a more general study of connected and coconnected Hopf algebras inside a braided fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$. We describe such Hopf algebras as orbits for the action of a reductive group on an affine variety. We then show that the closed orbits are precisely the orbits of Nichols algebras, and that all other algebras are therefore deformations of Nichols algebras. For the case where the category $\\mathcal{C}$ is the category $^G_G\\mathcal{YD}$ of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a finite group $G$, this reduces the question of generation by group-like elements and skew-primitives to a geometric question about rigidity of orbits. Comparing the results of Angiono Kochetov and Mastnak, this gives a new proof for the generation of finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras with abelian groups of group-like elements by skew-primitives and group-like elements. We show that if $V$ is a simple object in $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\text{B}(V)$ is finite dimensional, then $\\text{B}(V)$ must be rigid.

For coupled three qubits interacting with a photon field, a realizable scheme for a single-step Toffoli gate is investigated. We find that the three qubit system can be described by four effective modified Jaynes-Cummings models in the states of two control qubits. Within the rotating wave approximation, the modified Jaynes-Cummings models are shown to be reduced to the conventional Jaynes-Cummings models with renormalized couplings between qubits and photon fields. A single-step Toffoli gate is shown to be realizable with tuning the four characteristic oscillation periods that satisfy a commensurate condition. Possible values of system parameters are estimated for single-step Toffli gate. From numerical calculation, further, our single-step Toffoli gate operation errors are discussed due to imperfections in system parameters, which shows that a Toffoli gate with high fidelity can be obtained by adjusting pairs of the photon-qubit and the qubit-qubit coupling strengthes. In addition, a decoherence effect on the Toffoli gate operation is discussed due to a thermal reservoir."

By fitting a 6' (~360 h_50^-1 kpc) region with a single Mewe-Kaastra-Liedahl model with photoelectric absorption, we find a temperature of 2.1 - 2.3 keV, and abundance of 0.45 - 0.77 (both 90% confidence). We find the addition of a power-law component provides a statistically significant improvement (F-test = 90%) to the fit. The addition of a second thermal component also improves the fit but we argue that it is physically implausible. The power-law component has a photon index (Gamma_X) of 0.4 - 2.8 and a nonthermal flux of (4.1 - 56.7) x 10-5 photons cm^-2 s^-1 over the 1.5 - 10.5 keV range in the Medium Energy Concentrator spectrometer detector. An unidentified X-ray source found in the ROSAT High Resolution Imager observation (~0'.9 from the center of the cluster) is a possible explanation for the nonthermal flux; however, additional evidence of diffuse, nonthermal emission comes from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey radio measurements, in which excess diffuse, radio flux is observed after point-source subtraction. The radio excess can be fitted to a simple power law with a spectral index of ~1.8, which is consistent with the nonthermal X-ray emission spectral index. The steep spectrum is typical of diffuse emission and the size of the radio source implies that it is larger than the cD galaxy and not due to a discreet source."

The deep observation of 197.4 h has been performed with the HEGRA stereoscopic system of 5 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT system). 1ES1959+650 is located at a redshift of z = 0.047, providing an intermediate distance between the nearby Blazars Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, and the much more distant object H1426+428.

In this chapter, I argue that the restriction of centering to operating within a discourse segment should be abandoned in order to integrate centering with a model of global discourse structure. The within-segment restriction causes three problems. The first problem is that centers are often continued over discourse segment boundaries with pronominal referring expressions whose form is identical to those that occur within a discourse segment. The second problem is that recent work has shown that listeners perceive segment boundaries at various levels of granularity. If centering models a universal processing phenomenon, it is implausible that each listener is using a different centering algorithm.The third issue is that even for utterances within a discourse segment, there are strong contrasts between utterances whose adjacent utterance within a segment is hierarchically recent and those whose adjacent utterance within a segment is linearly recent. This chapter argues that these problems can be eliminated by replacing Grosz and Sidner's stack model of attentional state with an alternate model, the cache model. I show how the cache model is easily integrated with the centering algorithm, and provide several types of data from naturally occurring discourses that support the proposed integrated model. Future work should provide additional support for these claims with an examination of a larger corpus of naturally occurring discourses."

        "Abstract": "The stability of a leadership against a growing internal opposition is studied in bottom-up hierarchical organizations. Using a very simple model with bottom-up majority rule voting, the dynamics of power distribution at the various hierarchical levels is calculated within a probabilistic framework. Given a leadership at the top, the opposition weight from the hierarchy bottom is shown to fall off quickly while climbing up the hierarchy. It reaches zero after only a few hierarchical levels. Indeed the voting process is found to obey a threshold dynamics with a deterministic top outcome. Accordingly the leadership may stay stable against very large amplitude increases in the opposition at the bottom level. An opposition can thus grow steadily from few percent up to seventy seven percent with not one a single change at the elected top level. However and in contrast, from one election to another, in the vicinity of the threshold, less than a one percent additional shift at the bottom level can drive a drastic and brutal change at the top. The opposition topples the current leadership at once. In addition to analytical formulas, results from a large scale simulation are presented. The results may shed a new light on management architectures as well as on alert systems. They could also provide some different insight on last century's Eastern European communist collapse."

Most existing network inference solutions focus on the scenario when the observed data are vectors or matrices, and formulate the network comparison problem as comparing two covariance or precision matrices under a normal or matrix normal distribution. Moreover, many suffer from a limited power under a small sample size. In this article, we tackle the problem of network comparison when the data come in a different format, i.e., in the form of a collection of symmetric matrices, each of which encodes the network structure of an individual subject. Such data format commonly arises in applications such as brain connectivity analysis and clinical genomics. We no longer require the underlying data to follow a normal distribution, but instead impose some moment conditions that are easily satisfied for numerous types of network data. Furthermore, we propose a power enhancement procedure, and show that it can control the false discovery, while it has the potential to substantially enhance the power of the test. We investigate the efficacy of our testing procedure through both an asymptotic analysis, and a simulation study under a finite sample size. We further illustrate our method with an example of brain structural connectivity analysis."

In this paper we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and reconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show that mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in sensing time-invariant bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor encounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a time-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal received at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a configuration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel lines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of motion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a sampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in sampling noise due to the filter. We also analyze the effects of non-uniform sensor speeds on the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulation examples we demonstrate the advantages of mobile sampling over static sampling in practical problems.   We extend our analysis to sampling and reconstruction schemes for monitoring time-varying bandlimited fields using mobile sensors. We demonstrate that in some situations we require a lower density of sensors when using a mobile sensing scheme instead of the conventional static sensing scheme. The exact advantage is quantified for a problem of sampling and reconstructing an audio field."

        "Abstract": "The early work of Lorentz, Abraham and others, evolved through the work of Fokker, Dirac and others to ultimately culminate in the Feynman- Wheeler direct action at a distance theory. However this theory has encountered certain conceptual difficulties like non-locality in time, self force of the electron, pre acceleration and the perfect absorption condition of Feynman and Wheeler, that is the instantaneous action of the remaining charges in the universe on the charge in question. More recently, Hoyle and Narlikar have resurrected this theory, but within the context of a Steady State or Quasi Steady State cosmology. They argue that the theory infact has a better standing than the generally accepted quantum theoretic description. In this article we consider a quantum theoretic description and a cosmology which parallels the Hoyle-Narlikar approach. This leads to a synthesis and justification of the Dirac and Feynman-Wheeler approaches, clarifying the conceptual problems in the process. We deduce a scenario with quantized space-time and a holistic cosmology, consistent with physical and astrophysical data. The non-locality is now seen to be meaningful within the minimum space-time intervals, as also the perfect absorption within the holistic description. Local realism, and the usual causal field theory are seen to have an underpinning of direct action. For example this is brought out by the virtual photons which mediate interactions in Quantum Electro Dynamics, and the emergence of the inverse square law in the above approach from a background Zero Point Field."

Using end-to-end learning, I investigated whether the center-of-pressure trajectory is sufficiently unique to identify a person with a high certainty. Thirty-six adults walked on a treadmill equipped with a force platform that recorded the positions of the center of pressure. The raw two-dimensional signals were sliced into segments of two gait cycles. A set of 20,250 segments from 30 subjects was used to configure and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best CNN classified a separated set containing 2,250 segments with 99.9% overall accuracy. A second set of 4,500 segments from the six remaining subjects was then used for transfer learning. Several small subsamples of this set were selected randomly and used for fine tuning. Training with two segments per subject was sufficient to achieve 100% accuracy. The results suggest that every person produces a unique trajectory of underfoot pressures and that CNNs can learn the distinctive features of these trajectories. Using transfer learning, a few strides could be sufficient to learn and identify new gaits."

        "Abstract": "We study an incremental redundancy (IR) cooperative coding scheme for wireless networks. To exploit the spatial diversity benefit we propose a cluster-based collaborating strategy for a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel model and based on a network geometric distance profile. Our scheme enhances the network performance by embedding an IR cooperative coding scheme into an existing noncooperative route. More precisely, for each hop, we form a collaborating cluster of M-1 nodes between the (hop) sender and the (hop) destination. The transmitted message is encoded using a mother code and partitioned into M blocks corresponding to the each of M slots. In the first slot, the (hop) sender broadcasts its information by transmitting the first block, and its helpers attempt to relay this message. In the remaining slots, the each of left-over M-1 blocks is sent either through a helper which has successfully decoded the message or directly by the (hop) sender where a dynamic schedule is based on the ACK-based feedback from the cluster. By employing powerful good codes (e.g., turbo codes, LDPC codes, and raptor codes) whose performance is characterized by a threshold behavior, our approach improves the reliability of a multi-hop routing through not only cooperation diversity benefit but also a coding advantage. The study of the diversity and the coding gain of the proposed scheme is based on a new simple threshold bound on the frame-error rate (FER) of maximum likelihood decoding. A average FER upper bound and its asymptotic (in large SNR) version are derived as a function of the average fading channel SNRs and the code threshold."

This technique is based on tensor computation. A tensor is a high-dimensional generalization of a matrix or a vector. By exploiting the hidden low-rank property of a high-dimensional data array, the large amount of unknown variation testing data may be predicted from a few random measurement samples. The tensor rank, which decides the complexity of a tensor representation, is decided by an available variational Bayesian approach. Our approach is validated by a practical chip testing data set, and it can be easily generalized to characterize the process variations of multiple wafers. Our approach is more efficient than the previous virtual probe techniques in terms of memory and computational cost when handling high-dimensional chip testing data."

        "Abstract": "Considering a canonical ensemble, in which the temperature and the charge on a wall of the cavity are fixed, we investigate the thermodynamics of a D-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black hole in a finite spherical cavity. Moreover, it shows that the first law of thermodynamics is still satisfied. We then discuss the phase structure and transition in both five and six dimensions. Specifically, we show that there always exist two regions in the parameter space. In one region, the system possesses one single phase. However in the other region, there could coexist three phases and a van der Waals-like phase transition occurs. Finally, we find that there is a fairly close resemblance in thermodynamic properties and phase structure of a Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell black hole, either in a cavity or in anti-de Sitter space."

        "Abstract": "Archiving large sets of medical or cell images in digital libraries may require ordering randomly scattered sets of image data according to specific criteria, such as the spatial extent of a specific local color or contrast content that reveals different meaningful states of a physiological structure, tissue, or cell in a certain order, indicating progression or recession of a pathology, or the progressive response of a cell structure to treatment. Here we used a Self Organized Map (SOM)-based, fully automatic and unsupervised, classification procedure described in our earlier work and applied it to sets of minimally processed grayscale and/or color processed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of CD4+ T-lymphocytes (so-called helper cells) with varying extent of HIV virion infection. It is shown that the quantization error in the SOM output after training permits to scale the spatial magnitude and the direction of change (+ or -) in local pixel contrast or color across images of a series with a reliability that exceeds that of any human expert. The procedure is easily implemented and fast, and represents a promising step towards low-cost automatic digital image archiving with minimal intervention of a human operator."

We give a new definition of a vertex algebra which includes chiral algebras as a special case, but allows for fields which are neither meromorphic nor anti-meromorphic. To any complex torus equipped with a flat Kahler metric and a closed 2-form we associate an N=2 superconformal vertex algebra (N=2 SCVA) in the sense of our definition. We find a criterion for two different tori to produce isomorphic N=2 SCVA's. We show that for algebraic tori isomorphism of N=2 SCVA's implies the equivalence of the derived categories of coherent sheaves corresponding to the tori or their noncommutative generalizations (Azumaya algebras over tori). We also find a criterion for two different tori to produce N=2 SCVA's related by a mirror morphism. If the 2-form is of type (1,1), this condition is identical to the one proposed by Golyshev, Lunts, and Orlov, who used an entirely different approach inspired by the Homological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture of Kontsevich. Our results suggest that Kontsevich's conjecture must be modified: coherent sheaves must be replaced with modules over Azumaya algebras, and the Fukaya category must be ``twisted'' by a closed 2-form. We also describe the implications of our results for BPS D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds."

They are multivariate polynomials whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a Reed-Solomon code. We consider a generalization of their construction, which we call lifted multiplicity codes. These are multivariate polynomial codes whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a multiplicity code (Kopparty, Saraf, Yekhanin 2014). We show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and a notion of locality called the $t$-disjoint-repair-group property than previously known constructions. More precisely, we show that lifted multiplicity codes with length $N$ and redundancy $O(t^{0.585} \\sqrt{N})$ have the property that any symbol of a codeword can be reconstructed in $t$ different ways, each using a disjoint subset of the other coordinates. This gives the best known trade-off for this problem for any super-constant $t < \\sqrt{N}$. We also give an alternative analysis of lifted Reed Solomon codes using dual codes, which may be of independent interest."

The basic electronic structure of the cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. We introduce Anderson's idea of the resonating valence bond (RVB) and argue that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuation is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature which is driven by phase fluctuation and thermal excitation of quasiparticles. We then describe the numerical method of projected wavefunction which turns out to be a very useful technique to implement the strong correlation constraint, and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the RVB idea on a more formal footing. The slave-boson is introduced to enforce the constraint of no double occupation. The implementation of the local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. We give a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. We next describe the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping. We show that inclusion of gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase."

This represents the physical situation, which could for instance have appeared in the early universe, where a cosmic membrane (thin domain wall) is located near a black hole. Considering stationary axially symmetric membranes, three different membrane-topologies are possible depending on the boundary conditions at infinity: 2+1 Minkowski topology, 2+1 wormhole topology and 2+1 black hole topology.   Interestingly, we find that the different membrane-topologies are connected via phase transitions of the form first discussed by Choptuik in investigations of scalar field collapse. More precisely, we find a first order phase transition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black hole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between Minkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a naked singularity.   For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation analogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the parameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions. We find that $Mass\\propto|\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_*|^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma\\approx 0.66$. We also find a periodic wiggle in the scaling relation.   Our results show that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is far more general than expected."

Here we study the interplay between these two strategies, for a diffusing particle in an one-dimensional trapping potential $V(x)$, being randomly reset at a constant rate $r$. Stochastic resetting has been of great interest as it is known to provide an \"optimal rate\" ($r_*$) at which the mean first passage time is a minimum. On the other hand an attractive potential also assists in first capture process. Interestingly, we find that for a sufficiently strong external potential, the advantageous optimal resetting rate vanishes (i.e. $r_*\\to 0$). We derive a condition for this $optimal$ $resetting$ $rate$ $vanishing$ $transition$, which is continuous. We study this problem for various functional forms of $V(x)$, some analytically, and the rest numerically. We find that the optimal rate $r_*$ vanishes with the deviation from critical strength of the potential as a power law with an exponent $\\beta$ which appears to be universal."

This is by far the smallest separation binary quasar reported to date. The two components have very different spectra, including the presence of strong broad absorption lines (BALs) in component A only. The emission-line redshifts, based on the broad high ionization C IV lines, are z_A = 0.834 and z_B = 0.858; their difference is 3900 km/s in velocity units. The broad C IV lines, however, are probably not a good indicator of systemic redshift; and LBQS 0103-2753 A and B could have a much smaller systemic redshift difference, like the other known binary quasars. If the systemic redshift difference is small, then LBQS 0103-2753 would most likely be a galaxy merger that has led to a binary supermassive black hole. There is now one known 0.3 arcsec binary among roughly 500 QSOs that have been observed in a way that would reveal such a close binary. This suggests that QSO activity is substantially more likely for black hole binaries at spacings ~2 kpc than at ~15 to 60 kpc. Between 1987 and 1998, the observed Mg II BAL disappeared."

Detection and segmentation of MS lesions is a complex task largely due to the extreme unbalanced data, with very small number of lesion pixels that can be used for training. Utilizing the anatomical knowledge that the lesion surrounding pixels may also include some lesion level information, we suggest to increase the data set of the lesion class with neighboring pixel data - with a reduced confidence weight. A soft mask is constructed by morphological dilation of the binary segmentation mask provided by a given expert, where expert-marked voxels receive label 1 and voxels of the dilated region are assigned a soft label. In the methodology proposed, the FCNN is trained using the soft mask. On the ISBI 2015 challenge dataset, this is shown to provide a better precision-recall tradeoff and to achieve a higher average Dice similarity coefficient. We also show that by using this soft mask scheme we can improve the network segmentation performance when compared to a second independent expert."

We compare responses of a Josephson junction and a normal junction on the magnetization dynamics. In both cases the electromotive force resulting from the magnetization dynamics generates a voltage between the junction leads. For an open circuit this voltage is the same for both normal and superconducting leads and allows for electrical detection of magnetization dynamics and a structure of a time-dependent magnetization. However, under the applied current the electrical response of the Josephson junction is essentially different due to the strong dependence of the critical Josephson current on the magnetization direction. We propose a setup, which is able to detect a defect motion and to provide detailed information about the structure of magnetic inhomogeneity. The discussed effect can be of interest for spintronics applications."

The basis is the theory of semigroups of linear operators mapping a Banach space $X$ into itself. The rates of approximation play a basic role.   Another tool is a Drazin-like inverse operator $B$ for the infinitesimal generator $A$ of a semigroup that arises naturally in ergodic theory. This operator $B$ is a closed, not necessarily bounded, operator. It was introduced in a paper with U. Westphal (1970/71) and extended to a generalized setting with J. J. Koliha (2009).   The novel open problem concerns the third or Robin's problem of potential theory, the solution of which is not a semigroup of operators. Hence, the semigroup methods applied to Dirichlet's or Neumann's problem cannot be applied. The authors give several hints how to overcome these difficulties."

The method is model-independent and relies on variations between the observed spectra. The projections (PC1,PC2) reveal a difference with respect to environment, with a wider range in PC1 and PC2 in the group sample. We define a spectral parameter (zeta=0.36PC1-PC2) which simplifies this result to a single number: field galaxies have a very similar value of zeta, whereas HCG galaxies span a wide range in this parameter. We obtain a strong correlation between the values of zeta and the mass fraction in younger stars, so that some group galaxies present a higher fraction of them. PCA is more sensitive than other methods based on a direct analysis of observables such as the structure of the surface brightness profile or the equivalent width of absorption lines. The latter do not reveal any significant variation between field and compact group galaxies. Our results imply that the presence of young stars only amounts to a fraction of a percent in its contribution to the total variance."

Through scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence (STML) we are able to generate plasmonic light originating from inelastic tunneling processes that occur in a few-nanometer thick molecular film of C$_{60}$ deposited on Ag(111). Single photon emission, not of excitonic origin, occurs with a 1/$e$ lifetime of a tenth of a nanosecond or less, as shown through Hanbury Brown and Twiss photon intensity interferometry. We have performed tight-binding calculations of the electronic structure for the combined Ag-C$_{60}$-tip system and obtained good agreement with experiment. The tunneling happens through electric field induced split-off states below the C$_{60}$ LUMO band, which leads to a Coulomb blockade effect and single photon emission. The use of split-off states is shown to be a general technique that has special relevance for narrowband materials with a large bandgap."

        "Abstract": "We model the 1990 giant X-ray flare of the quiescent galaxy NGC 5905 as the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. From the observed rapid decline of the luminosity, over a timescale of a few years, we argue that the flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequent accretion via a thin disk. The fallback model allows constraints to be set on the black hole mass and the mass of debris. The latter must be very much less than a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. The observations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outer layers of a low-mass main sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarf or a giant planet. We find that the X-ray emission in the flare must have originated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus of circularized material surrounding the black hole. We suggest that the patch corresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impacts the torus. Interestingly, although the peak luminosity of the flare was highly sub-Eddington, the peak flux from the bright spot was close to the Eddington limit. We speculate on the implications of this result for observations of other flare events."

The second is a fair meta-learning approach to train models that can be trained through gradient descent with the objective of \"learning how to learn fairly\". This method encodes more general notions of fairness and accuracy into the model so that it can learn new tasks within a domain both quickly and fairly from only a few training points. We demonstrate experimentally the individual utility of each model using relevant baselines for comparison and provide the first experiment to our knowledge of K-shot fairness, i.e. training a fair model on a new task with only K data points. Then, we illustrate the usefulness of both algorithms as a combined method for training models from a few data points on new tasks while using Fairness Warnings as interpretable boundary conditions under which the newly trained model may not be fair."

In order to include all the relevant physical ingredients (2-body relaxation, stellar mass spectrum, collisions, tidal disruption,...), we chose to revive a numerical scheme pioneered by Henon in the 70's. It is basically a Monte Carlo resolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. It can cope with any stellar mass spectrum or velocity distribution. Being a particle-based method, it also allows one to take stellar collisions into account in a very realistic way. This first paper covers the basic version of our code which treats the relaxation-driven evolution of stellar cluster without a central BH. A technical description of the code is presented, as well as the results of test computations. Thanks to the use of a binary tree to store potential and rank information and of variable time steps, cluster models with up to 2 million particles can be simulated on a standard personal computer and the CPU time required scales as N*ln(N) with the particle number N. Furthermore, the number of simulated stars needs not be equal to N but can be arbitrarily larger. A companion paper will treat further physical ingredients, mostly relevant to galactic nuclei."

Gauge field Poisson brackets differ from the Heisenberg algebra, but are reminiscent of Yang-Mills theory on a null surface. Enstrophy invariants are Casimirs of the Poisson algebra of gauge invariant observables. Some symplectic leaves of the Poisson manifold are identified. The Hamiltonian is a magnetic energy, similar to that of electrodynamics, and depends on a metric whose volume element is not a multiple of mu. The magnetic field evolves by a quadratically non-linear `Euler' equation, which may also be regarded as describing geodesic flow on SDiff(M,mu). Static solutions are obtained. For uniform mu, an infinite sequence of local conserved charges beginning with the hamiltonian are found. The charges are shown to be in involution, suggesting integrability. Besides being a theory of a novel kind of ideal flow, this is a toy-model for Yang-Mills theory and matrix field theories, whose gauge-invariant phase space is conjectured to be a coadjoint orbit of the diffeomorphism group of a non-commutative space."

On the other hand, due to the presence of the boundary the point interactions give rise to infinite series of resonances; if the coupling is weak they approach the thresholds of higher transverse modes. We derive also spectral and scattering properties for point perturbations in several related models: a cylindrical surface, both of a finite and infinite heigth, threaded by a magnetic flux, and a straight strip which supports a potential independent of the transverse coordinate. As for strips with an infinite number of point perturbations, we restrict ourselves to the situation when the latter are arranged periodically; we show that in distinction to the case of a point--perturbation array in the plane, the spectrum may exhibit any finite number of gaps.

We consider in detail the thermodynamics and quasi-static collapse of a self-gravitating shell. This includes a discussion of intrinsic stability for a one-parameter family of thermal equations of state and the interpretation of the Bekenstein bound. The entropy growth associated with a collapsing sequence of equilibrium states of a shell is computed under different boundary conditions in the quasi-static approximation and compared with black hole entropy. Although explicit expressions involve empirical coefficients, these are constrained by physical conditions of thermodynamical origin. The absence of a Gibbs-Duhem relation and the associated scaling laws for self-gravitating matter systems are presented."

        "Abstract": "We consider the discrete Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis process (HAD) and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in Z. The basic coupling induces a multiclass process which is useful in discussing shock measures and other important properties of the processes. The invariant measures of the multiclass systems are the same for both processes, and can be constructed as the law of the output process of a system of multiclass queues in tandem; the arrival and service processes of the queueing system are a collection of independent Bernoulli product measures. The proof of invariance involves a new coupling between stationary versions of the processes called a multi-line process; this process has a collection of independent Bernoulli product measures as an invariant measure. Some of these results have appeared elsewhere and this paper is partly a review, with some proofs given only in outline. However we emphasize a new approach via dual points: when the graphical construction is used to construct a trajectory of the TASEP or HAD process as a function of a Poisson process in ZxR, the dual points are those which govern the time-reversal of the trajectory. Each line of the multi-line process is governed by the dual points of the line below. We also mention some other processes whose multiclass versions have the same invariant measures, and we note an extension of Burke's theorem to multiclass queues which follows from the results."

In this work, using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in combination with a theory of dipole-exchange spin-wave spectra, we show that in obliquely magnetized free magnetic films the in-plane propagation of spin waves is accompanied by a transverse spin current along the film normal without any corresponding transverse transport of energy."

The approach builds upon two components: 1) a robust detector that uses recurrent deep neural networks to dynamically detect a variety of situations of interest, such as zero velocity or no lateral slip; and 2) a state-of-the-art Kalman filter which incorporates this knowledge as pseudo-measurements for localization. Evaluations on a publicly available car dataset demonstrates that the proposed scheme may achieve a final precision of 20 m for a 21 km long trajectory of a vehicle driving for over an hour, equipped with an IMU of moderate precision (the gyro drift rate is 10 deg/h). To our knowledge, this is the first paper which combines sophisticated deep learning techniques with state-of-the-art filtering methods for pure inertial navigation on wheeled vehicles and as such opens up for novel data-driven inertial navigation techniques. Moreover, albeit taylored for IMU-only based localization, our method may be used as a component for self-localization of wheeled robots equipped with a more complete sensor suite."

The prediction results of traditional networks give a bias toward larger classes, which tend to be the background in the semantic segmentation task. This becomes a major problem for fault detection, where the targets appear very small on the images and vary in both types and sizes. In this paper we propose a new network architecture, DefectNet, that offers multi-class (including but not limited to) defect detection on highly-imbalanced datasets. DefectNet consists of two parallel paths, which are a fully convolutional network and a dilated convolutional network to detect large and small objects respectively. We propose a hybrid loss maximising the usefulness of a dice loss and a cross entropy loss, and we also employ the leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU) to deal with rare occurrence of some targets in training batches. The prediction results show that our DefectNet outperforms state-of-the-art networks for detecting multi-class defects with the average accuracy improvement of approximately 10% on a wind turbine."

The spectrum of this object can be described by a blackbody model with the temperature kT=404 eV and radius of the emitting region R=0.28 km, at a distance of 1 kpc. Power-law and thermal plasma models do not fit the source spectrum. The spectrum shows a marginally significant feature at 1.68 keV. Search for periodicity yields two candidate periods, about 301 ms and 33 ms, both significant at a 2.1 sigma level; the corresponding pulsed fractions are 13% and 9%, respectively. We find no evidence for long-term variability of the source flux, nor do we find extended emission around the central object. We suggest that CXOU J085201.4--461753 is similar to CXOU J232327.9+584842, the central source of the supernova remnant Cas A. It could be either a neutron star with a low or regular magnetic field, slowly accreting from a fossil disk, or, more likely, an isolated neutron star with a superstrong magnetic field. In either case, a conservative upper limit on surface temperature of a 10 km radius neutron star is about 90 eV, which suggests accelerated cooling for a reasonable age of a few thousand years."

The advantage of the present procedure over the ones using a deformed Woods Saxon or Nilsson single particle basis is that the actual pnQRPA states have a definite angular momentum while all the others provide states having only K as a good quantum number. The model Hamiltonian involves a mean field term yielding the projected single particle states, a pairing interaction for alike nucleons and a dipole-dipole proton-neutron interaction in both the particle-hole (ph) and particle-particle (pp) channels. The effect of nuclear deformation on the single beta strength distribution as well as on the double beta Gamow-Teller transition amplitude (M$_{{\\rm GT}}$) is analyzed.

(There is also a definition for the nonunital case.) T. Quinn has recently shown that a unital AF algebra has the APFP if and only if it has no finite dimensional quotients. This paper is a more systematic investigation of C*-algebras with the APFP. We prove various properties of such algebras. For example: They have connected invertible group, trivial K_1, and stable rank 1. In the unital case, the K_0 group separates the tracial states. The APFP passes to matrix algebras. and if I is an ideal in A such that I and A/I have the APFP, then so does A. We also give some new examples of C*-algebras with the APFP, including type II_1 factors and infinite-dimensional simple unital direct limits with slow dimension growth, real rank zero, and trivial K_1 group. An infinite- dimensional simple unital direct limit with slow dimension growth and with the APFP must have real rank zero, but we also give examples of unital algebras with the APFP which do not have real rank zero.   Our analysis also leads to the introduction of a new concept of rank for a C*-algebra that may be of interest in the future."

We also prove a general result relating the dissipation time and the effective diffusivity of stationary cellular flows, which allows us to obtain examples of simple incompressible flows with arbitrarily small dissipation times.   As an application, we show that blow-up in the Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis can always be prevented if the velocity field of the ambient fluid has a sufficiently small dissipation time. We prove a similar result for a fluid dynamics model derived from the 3D Navier-Stokes equations by adding a convection term to their vorticity formulation. Finally we study reaction-diffusion equations with ignition-type nonlinearities, and show that the reaction can always be quenched by the addition of a convective term with a small enough dissipation time, provided the average initial temperature is initially below the ignition threshold."

According to Kohn's theorem, the frequency of this collective mode is not affected by an interaction between the atoms and is always equal to the trap frequency. This remarkable property, however, does not necessarily hold in an approximate theory. We explicitly prove that the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA), including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels, is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory developed by Nozi\\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\\it depend} on the strength of effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance."

        "Abstract": "The goal of the present account is to review our efforts to obtain and apply a ``collective'' Hamiltonian for a few, approximately decoupled, adiabatic degrees of freedom, starting from a Hamiltonian system with more or many more degrees of freedom. The approach is based on an analysis of the classical limit of quantum-mechanical problems. Initially, we study the classical problem within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics and derive a fully self-consistent theory of large amplitude collective motion with small velocities. We derive a measure for the quality of decoupling of the collective degree of freedom. We show for several simple examples, where the classical limit is obvious, that when decoupling is good, a quantization of the collective Hamiltonian leads to accurate descriptions of the low energy properties of the systems studied. In nuclear physics problems we construct the classical Hamiltonian by means of time-dependent mean-field theory, and we transcribe our formalism to this case. We report studies of a model for monopole vibrations, of $^{28}$Si with a realistic interaction, several qualitative models of heavier nuclei, and preliminary results for a more realistic approach to heavy nuclei. Other topics included are a nuclear Born-Oppenheimer approximation for an {\\em ab initio} quantum theory and a theory of the transfer of energy between collective and non-collective degrees of freedom when the decoupling is not exact.

Here we give an estimate of a threshold, beyond which transverse motion become chaotic, the electrons being unable to perform even one gyration, so that a breakdown should occur, with complete loss of confinement. The estimate is obtained by the methods of perturbation theory, taking as perturbing force acting on each electron that due to the so--called microfield, i.e., the electric field produced by all the other charges. We first obtain a general relation for the threshold, which involves the fluctuations of the microfield. Then, taking for such fluctuations the fomula given by Iglesias, Lebowitz and MacGowan for the model of a one component plasma with neutralizing background, we obtain a definite formula for the threshold, which corresponds to a density limit increasing as the square of the imposed magnetic field. Such a theoretical density limit is found to fit pretty well the empirical data for collapses of fusion machines."

In order to include all the relevant physical ingredients (2-body relaxation, stellar mass spectrum, collisions, tidal disruption,...), we chose to revive a numerical scheme pioneered by Henon in the 70's. It is basically a Monte Carlo resolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. It can cope with any stellar mass spectrum or velocity distribution. Being a particle-based method, it also allows one to take stellar collisions into account in a very realistic way. This first paper covers the basic version of our code which treats the relaxation-driven evolution of stellar cluster without a central BH. A technical description of the code is presented, as well as the results of test computations. Thanks to the use of a binary tree to store potential and rank information and of variable time steps, cluster models with up to 2 million particles can be simulated on a standard personal computer and the CPU time required scales as N*ln(N) with the particle number N. Furthermore, the number of simulated stars needs not be equal to N but can be arbitrarily larger. A companion paper will treat further physical ingredients, mostly relevant to galactic nuclei."

Bulk Comptonization of disc photons is shown to yield a spectral component contributing in the far UV band, and would then be currently unobservable. On the contrary, the bulk Comptonization of broad line photons may yield a significant feature in the soft X-ray band. Such a feature is time-dependent and transient, and dominates over the non thermal continuum only when: a) the dissipation occurs close to, but within, the broad line region; b) other competing processes, like the synchrotron self-Compton emission, yield a negligible flux in the X-ray band. The presence of a bulk Compton component may account for the X-ray properties of high redshift blazars that show a flattening (and possibly a hump) in the soft X-rays, previously interpreted as due to intrinsic absorption. We discuss why the conditions leading to a detectable bulk Compton feature might be met only occasionally in high redshift blazars, concluding that the absence of such a feature in the spectra of most blazars should not be taken as evidence against matter--dominated relativistic jets. The detection of such a component carries key information on the bulk Lorentz factor and kinetic energy associated to (cold) leptons."

The analysis is performed in the shearing box, a local model of a thin disk, using a decomposition in terms of shearing waves, i.e., plane waves in a frame comoving with the shear. These waves do not have a definite frequency as in a normal mode decomposition, and numerical integration of a coupled set of amplitude equations is required to characterize their time dependence. Their generic time dependence, however, is oscillatory with slowly-varying frequency and amplitude, and one can construct accurate analytical solutions by applying the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method to the full set of amplitude equations. The solutions have the following properties: 1) Their accuracy increases with wavenumber, so that most perturbations that fit within the disk are well-approximated as modes with time-dependent frequencies and amplitudes. 2) They can be broadly classed as incompressive and compressive perturbations, the former including the nonaxisymmetric extension of magnetorotationally unstable modes, and the latter being the extension of fast and slow modes to a differentially-rotating medium. 3) Wave action is conserved, implying that their energy varies with frequency. 4) Their shear stress is proportional to the slope of their frequency, so that they transport angular momentum outward (inward) when their frequency increases (decreases). The complete set of solutions constitutes a comprehensive linear test suite for numerical MHD algorithms that incorporate a background shear flow. I conclude with a brief discussion of possible astrophysical applications."

The PhaseDNN utilizes the fact that many DNN achieves convergence in the low frequency range first, thus, a series of moderately-sized of DNNs are constructed and trained in parallel for ranges of higher frequencies. With the help of phase shifts in the frequency domain, implemented through a simple phase factor multiplication on the training data, each DNN in the series will be trained to approximate the target function's higher frequency content over a specific range. Due to the phase shift, each DNN achieves the speed of convergence as in the low frequency range. As a result, the proposed PhaseDNN system is able to convert wideband frequency learning to low frequency learning, thus allowing a uniform learning to wideband high dimensional functions with frequency adaptive training. Numerical results have demonstrated the capability of PhaseDNN in learning information of a target function from low to high frequency uniformly."

The orbital fit to the combined data gives a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude of 43.9 m/s, and an eccentricity of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 Msun, this implies a mass for the companion of 1.5 sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital eccentricity cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal manner with a low eccentricity orbit, and has undergone post-formational orbital evolution, either through the same process which formed the ``massive eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD114762, or by gravitational interactions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the object is an extremely low mass brown dwarf, formed through fragmentation of the collapsing protostar. We explore a possible connection between stellar photospheric Li depletion, pre-main sequence stellar rotation, the presence of a massive proto-planetary disk, and the formation of a planetary companion."

The inverse approach to deduce a structure for a predefined property would be highly desirable, but is, unfortunately, not well-defined. However, feasible strategies for such an inverse design process may be successfully developed for specific purposes. We discuss options for calculating 'jacket' potentials that fulfill a predefined target requirement - a concept that we recently introduced [T. Weymuth, M. Reiher, MRS Proceediungs, 2013, 1524, DOI:10.1557/opl.2012.1764]. We consider the case of small-molecule activating transition metal catalysts. As a target requirement we choose the vanishing geometry gradients on all atoms of a subsystem consisting of a metal center binding the small molecule to be activated. The jacket potential can be represented within a full quantum model or by a sequence of approximations of which a field of electrostatic point charges is the simplest. In a second step, the jacket potential needs to be replaced by a chemically viable chelate-ligand structure for which the geometry gradients on all of its atoms are also required to vanish. In order to analyze the feasibility of this approach, we dissect a known dinitrogen-fixating catalyst to study possible design strategies that must eventually produce the known catalyst."

We explore fermion number violating processes which involve soliton decay. A soliton can decay by tunnelling under the sphaleron barrier, or the decay can be collision induced if the energy is sufficient for the barrier to be traversed. We present a classical solution to the Minkowski space equations of motion in which a soliton is kicked over the barrier by an incoming pulse. This pulse corresponds to a quantum coherent state with mean number of $W$ quanta $\\sim 2.5/g^2$ where $g$ is the $SU(2)$ gauge coupling constant. We also give a self-contained treatment of the relationship between classical solutions, including those in which solitons are destroyed, and tree-level quantum amplitudes. Furthermore, we consider a limit in which we can reliably estimate the amplitude for soliton decay induced by collision with a single $W$-boson. This amplitude depends on $g$ like $\\exp (-cg^{-1/3})$, and is larger than that for spontaneous decay via tunnelling in the same limit. Finally we show that in soliton decays, light $SU(2)_L$ doublet fermions are anomalously produced. Thus we have a calculation of a two body process with energy above the sphaleron barrier in which fermion number is violated."

However, an important drawback of that design is a high impedance, as seen by a beam, because of the magnet laminations. More recent RCS designs (e.g. J-PARC) employ large and complex ceramic vacuum chambers in order to mitigate the eddy current effects and to shield the beam from the magnet laminations. Such a design, albeit very successful, is quite costly because it requires large-bore magnets and large-bore RF cavities. In this article, we will consider an RCS concept with a thin-wall metallic vacuum chamber as a compromise between the chamber-less Fermilab Booster design and the large-bore design with ceramic chambers."

        "Title": "Fluctuations, dissipation, and nonuniversal superfluid jumps in  two-dimensional superconductors",
        "Abstract": "We report a comprehensive study of the complex AC conductivity of thin effectively 2D amorphous superconducting InO_x films at zero applied field. Below a temperature scale T_c0 where the superconducting order parameter amplitude becomes well defined, there is a temperature where both the generalized superfluid stiffness acquires a frequency dependence and the DC mangetoresistance becomes linear in field. We associate this with a transition of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii (KTB) type. At our measurement frequencies the superfluid stiffness at T_KTB is found to be larger than the universal value. Although this may be understood with a vortex dielectric constant of epsilon_v ~ 1.9 within the usual KTB theory, this is a relatively large value and indicates that such a system may be out of the domain of applicability of the low-fugacity (low vortex density) KTB treatment. This opens up the possibility that at least some of the discrepancy from a non-universal magnitude is intrinsic. Our finite frequency measurements allow us access to a number of other phenomena concerning the charge dynamics in superconducting thin films, including an enhanced conductivity near the amplitude fluctuation temperature T_c0 and a finite dissipation at low temperature which appears to be a universal aspect of highly disordered superconducting films."

        "Abstract": "For closed 3-manifolds, Heegaard Floer homology is related to the Thurston norm through results due to Ozsv\\'ath and Szab\\'o, Ni, and Hedden. For example, given a closed 3-manifold Y, there is a bijection between vertices of the HF^+(Y) polytope carrying the group Z and the faces of the Thurston norm unit ball that correspond to fibrations of Y over the unit circle. Moreover, the Thurston norm unit ball of Y is dual to the polytope of \\underline{\\hfhat}(Y).   We prove a similar bijection and duality result for a class of 3-manifolds with boundary called sutured manifolds. A sutured manifold is essentially a cobordism between two surfaces R_+ and R_- that have nonempty boundary. We show that there is a bijection between vertices of the sutured Floer polytope carrying the group Z and equivalence classes of taut depth one foliations that form the foliation cones of Cantwell and Conlon. Moreover, we show that a function defined by Juh\\'asz, which we call the geometric sutured function,is analogous to the Thurston norm in this context. In some cases, this function is an asymmetric norm and our duality result is that appropriate faces of this norm's unit ball subtend the foliation cones.   An important step in our work is the following fact: a sutured manifold admits a fibration or a taut depth one foliation whose sole compact leaves are exactly the connected components of R_+ and R_-, if and only if, there is a surface decomposition of the sutured manifold resulting in a connected product manifold."

        "Abstract": "The ``warp drive'' metric recently presented by Alcubierre has the problem that an observer at the center of the warp bubble is causally separated from the outer edge of the bubble wall. Hence such an observer can neither create a warp bubble on demand nor control one once it has been created. In addition, such a bubble requires negative energy densities. One might hope that elimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that although the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In our four dimensional extension of this metric, a ``tube'' is constructed along the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star. Inside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to allow superluminal travel in one direction. We show that, although a single Krasnikov tube does not involve closed timelike curves, a time machine can be constructed with a system of two non-overlapping tubes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Krasnikov tubes, like warp bubbles and traversable wormholes, also involve unphysically thin layers of negative energy density, as well as large total negative energies, and therefore probably cannot be realized in practice."

A recent machine-learning approach uses a neural network to output a learned representation with local maxima at the position of the frequency estimates. In this work, we propose a novel neural-network architecture that produces a significantly more accurate representation, and combine it with an additional neural-network module trained to detect the number of frequencies. This yields a fast, fully-automatic method for frequency estimation that achieves state-of-the-art results. In particular, it outperforms existing techniques by a substantial margin at medium-to-high noise levels."

The method of alternating projections is the simplest iterative procedure for finding a solution and it goes back to von Neumann. In the present paper, we study some stability properties for this method in the following sense: we consider two sequences of sets, each of them converging, with respect to the Attouch-Wets convergence, respectively, to $A$ and $B$. Given a starting point $a_0$, we consider the sequences of points obtained by projecting on the \"perturbed\" sets, i.e., the sequences $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$ given by $b_n=P_{B_n}(a_{n-1})$ and $a_n=P_{A_n}(b_n)$.

By applying a Cartan decomposition to su(4), we find that the geometric structure of non-local gates is a 3-Torus. We derive the invariants for local transformations, and connect these local invariants to the coordinates of the 3-Torus. Since different points on the 3-Torus may correspond to the same local equivalence class, we use the Weyl group theory to reduce the symmetry. We show that the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates are in one-to-one correspondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base. We then study the properties of perfect entanglers, that is, the two-qubit operations that can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable states. We provide criteria to determine whether a given two-qubit gate is a perfect entangler and establish a geometric description of perfect entanglers by making use of the tetrahedral representation of non-local gates. We find that exactly half the non-local gates are perfect entanglers. We also investigate the non-local operations generated by a given Hamiltonian. We first study the gates that can be directly generated by a Hamiltonian. Then we explicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains at most three non-local gates generated by a two-body interaction Hamiltonian, together with at most four local gates generated by single qubit terms. We prove that such a quantum circuit can simulate any arbitrary two-qubit gate exactly, and hence it provides an efficient implementation of universal quantum computation and simulation."

        "Abstract": "Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible amongst a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a ``selfish agent'', and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents to select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced.   Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m\\gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\\log\\log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\\log\\log m+n^4)$.

The method uses a spectral representation for the total electrostatic energy of the composite. The force is expressed as a certain gradient of this energy, which can be expressed in a closed analytic form rather than evaluated as a numerical derivative. The method is applicable even when both the spheres and the host have frequency-dependent dielectric functions and nonzero conductivities, provided the system is in the quasistatic regime. In principle, it includes all multipolar contributions to the force, and it can be used to calculate multi-body as well as pairwise forces. We also present several numerical examples, including host fluids with finite conductivities. The force between spheres approaches the dipole-dipole limit, as expected, at large separations, but departs drastically from that limit when the spheres are nearly in contact. The force may also change sign as a function of frequency when the host is a slightly conducting fluid."

A direct adaptation of a byte based cipher such as RC4 into a 32- or 64-bit word version will obviously need vast amounts of memory. This scaling issue necessitates a look for new components and principles, as well as mathematical analysis to justify their use. Our approach, like RC4's, is based on rapidly mixing random walks on directed graphs (that is, walks which reach a random state quickly, from any starting point). We begin with some well understood walks, and then introduce nonlinearity in their steps in order to improve security and show long term statistical correlations are negligible. To minimize the short term correlations, as well as to deter attacks using equations involving successive outputs, we provide a method for sequencing the outputs derived from the walk using three revolving buffers. The cipher is fast -- it runs at a speed of less than 5 cycles per byte on a Pentium IV processor. A word based cipher needs to output more bits per step, which exposes more correlations for attacks. Moreover we seek simplicity of construction and transparent analysis. To meet these requirements, we use a larger state and claim security corresponding to only a fraction of it. Our design is for an adequately secure word-based cipher; our very preliminary estimate puts the security close to exhaustive search for keys of size < 256 bits."

The approach is based on an analysis of the classical limit of quantum-mechanical problems. Initially, we study the classical problem within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics and derive a fully self-consistent theory of large amplitude collective motion with small velocities. We derive a measure for the quality of decoupling of the collective degree of freedom. We show for several simple examples, where the classical limit is obvious, that when decoupling is good, a quantization of the collective Hamiltonian leads to accurate descriptions of the low energy properties of the systems studied. In nuclear physics problems we construct the classical Hamiltonian by means of time-dependent mean-field theory, and we transcribe our formalism to this case. We report studies of a model for monopole vibrations, of $^{28}$Si with a realistic interaction, several qualitative models of heavier nuclei, and preliminary results for a more realistic approach to heavy nuclei. Other topics included are a nuclear Born-Oppenheimer approximation for an {\\em ab initio} quantum theory and a theory of the transfer of energy between collective and non-collective degrees of freedom when the decoupling is not exact.

After a sudden quench to the NFL, a thermal state is reached rapidly via collapse-revival oscillations of the quasiparticle residue of the lead fermions. In contrast, the quench to the FL, across the NFL-FL transition, leads to multiple prethermal regimes and much slower thermalization. In the slow quench performed over a time $\\tau$, we find that the excitation energy generated has a remarkable intermediate-$\\tau$ non-analytic power-law dependence, $\\tau^{-\\eta}$ with $\\eta<1$, which seemingly masks the dynamical manifestation of the initial residual entropy of the SYK fermions.

The jets are formed at a large (0.15 pc) distance from its central star by collimation of an asymmetric stellar wind in a pair of conical shocks seen in Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC2) images. The jets consist of several pairs of knots symmetrically distributed with respect to the central star, with most knots exhibiting a head-tail morphology. Large (up to 650 km/s) radial velocity gradients are seen within the knots on subarcsec scales, with velocities decreasing from the knot heads toward their trailing tails. These large velocity gradients are a sign of efficient deceleration of jets by a much slower bipolar outflow. The inclination angle of the bipolar outflow is equal to 40 degrees, based on Doppler shifts of the scattered stellar Halpha line. Its velocity is equal to 140 km/s at a distance of 0.23 pc from the star, and increases monotonically with the radial distance from the star. A comparison of new WFPC2 [N II] 6584 images with older WFPC2 images reveals expansion of the jets. The measured jet proper motions in combination with their radial velocities imply that He 3-1475 is a Galactic Bulge star at a distance of 8 kpc, located 800 pc above the Galactic plane. Its very high luminosity (25,000 solar luminosities) implies that He 3-1475 must be significantly more massive than a typical AGB star within the Galactic Bulge, perhaps because of a past mass transfer and/or a merger event in an interacting binary system."

However, previous approaches build a custom parent model or at least update an existing parent model's vocabulary for each child language pair they wish to train, in an effort to align parent and child vocabularies. This is not a practical solution. It is wasteful to devote the majority of training time for new language pairs to optimizing parameters on an unrelated data set. Further, this overhead reduces the utility of neural machine translation for deployment in humanitarian assistance scenarios, where extra time to deploy a new language pair can mean the difference between life and death. In this work, we present a `universal' pre-trained neural parent model with constant vocabulary that can be used as a starting point for training practically any new low-resource language to a fixed target language. We demonstrate that our approach, which leverages orthography unification and a broad-coverage approach to subword identification, generalizes well to several languages from a variety of families, and that translation systems built with our approach can be built more quickly than competing methods and with better quality as well."

CSS sources are thought to be young radio objects at the beginning of their evolution and can potentially test the cluster heating process. 1321+045 is a relatively low luminosity source and its morphology consists of two radio lobes on the opposite sides of a radio core with no evidence for jets or hotspots. The optical emission line ratios are consistent with an interstellar medium (ISM) dominated by AGN-photoionization with a small contribution from star formation, and no contributions from shocks. Based on these ratios, we classify 1321+045 as a low excitation galaxy (LEG) and suggest that its radio activity is in a coasting phase. The X-ray emission associated with the radio source is detected with 36.1+/-8.3 counts, but the origin of this emission is highly uncertain. The current X-ray image of the cluster does not show any signatures of a radio source impact on the cluster medium.

We confirm that the HeII\\lambda4686 line has a broad component with an average FWHM of v=780\\pm64 km/s with a variation of ~13% during observations spanning over 4 years, and is consistent with the origin in the accretion disc. The deepest optical spectrum does not reveal any absorption line from a donor star. Our aim was to measure the radial velocity curve and estimate the parameters of the binary system. We find an upper limit on the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity of K=132\\pm42 km/s. A search for a periodic signal in the data resulted in no statistically significant period. The mass function and constraints on the binary system imply a black hole mass of less than ~510 M_sun. Whilst, a disc irradiation model may imply a black hole mass smaller than ~431-1985 M_sun, depending on inclination. Our data can also be consistent with an unexplored orbital period range from a couple of hours to a few days, thus with a stellar-mass black hole and a subgiant companion."

        "Abstract": "We investigate strong coupling effects on the superfluid phase transition in a gas of Fermi atoms with a Feshbach resonance. The Feshbach resonance describes a composite quasi-Boson, which can give rise to an additional pairing interaction between the Fermi atoms. This attractive interaction becomes stronger as the threshold energy of the Feshbach resonance two-particle bound state is lowered. In a recent paper, we showed that in the uniform Fermi gas, this tunable pairing interaction naturally leads to a BCS-BEC crossover of the Nozi`eres and Schmitt-Rink kind, in which the BCS-type superfluid phase transition continuously changes into the BEC-type as the threshold energy is decreased. In this paper, we extend our previous work by including the effect of a harmonic trap potential, treated within the local density approximation (LDA). We also give results for both weak and strong coupling to the Feshbach resonance. We show that the BCS-BEC crossover phenomenon strongly modifies the shape of the atomic density profile at the superfluid phase transition temperature Tc, reflecting the change of the dominant particles going from Fermi atoms to composite Bosons. In the BEC regime, these composite Bosons are shown to first appear well above Tc. We also discuss the \"phase diagram\" above Tc as a function of the tunable threshold energy. We introduce a characteristic temperature T* describing the effective crossover in the normal phase from a Fermi gas of atoms to a gas of stable molecules."

        "Abstract": "Most existing real estate appraisal methods focus on building accuracy and reliable models from a given dataset but pay little attention to the extensibility of their trained model. As different cities usually contain a different set of location features (district names, apartment names), most existing mass appraisal methods have to train a new model from scratch for different cities or regions. As a result, these approaches require massive data collection for each city and the total training time for a multi-city property appraisal system will be extremely long. Besides, some small cities may not have enough data for training a robust appraisal model. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Homogeneous Feature Transfer and Heterogeneous Location Fine-tuning (HFT+HLF) cross-city property appraisal framework. By transferring partial neural network learning from a source city and fine-tuning on the small amount of location information of a target city, our semi-supervised model can achieve similar or even superior performance compared to a fully supervised Artificial neural network (ANN) method."

        "Abstract": "Transfer learning from a high-resource language pair `parent' has been proven to be an effective way to improve neural machine translation quality for low-resource language pairs `children.' However, previous approaches build a custom parent model or at least update an existing parent model's vocabulary for each child language pair they wish to train, in an effort to align parent and child vocabularies. This is not a practical solution. It is wasteful to devote the majority of training time for new language pairs to optimizing parameters on an unrelated data set. Further, this overhead reduces the utility of neural machine translation for deployment in humanitarian assistance scenarios, where extra time to deploy a new language pair can mean the difference between life and death. In this work, we present a `universal' pre-trained neural parent model with constant vocabulary that can be used as a starting point for training practically any new low-resource language to a fixed target language. We demonstrate that our approach, which leverages orthography unification and a broad-coverage approach to subword identification, generalizes well to several languages from a variety of families, and that translation systems built with our approach can be built more quickly than competing methods and with better quality as well."

        "Abstract": "We analyze systematic effects in the determination of the galaxy luminosity function in clusters using a deep mock catalogue constructed from a numerical simulation of a hierarchical universe. The results indicate a strong tendency to derive a rising faint end ($\\alpha \\lsim -1.5$) in clusters selected in two dimensions, using a galaxy catalogue constructed with a universal flat luminosity function with $\\alpha \\simeq -1.0$. This is due to the projection effects inherent in catalogues of clusters constructed using 2 dimensional data. Many of the clusters found in 2d have no significant 3d counterparts, and most suffer from massive background contamination that cannot be corrected for by subtracting random offset fields. The luminosity function of high surface brightness galaxies in the field and within small groups follows a Schechter function with a fairly flat faint end slope, $n(L)\\propto L^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha = -0.9$ to -1.2. On the contrary, observational studies of clusters constructed using Abell, EDCC and APM catalogues are systematically found to have steeper luminosity functions with $\\alpha = -1.4$ to -2.0. This may be attributed to projection effects rather than a dominant population of high surface brightness dwarf galaxies ($M\\gsim M^*+2$) in clusters. It should be straighforward to confirm our results by measuring redshifts of these faint cluster galaxies."

        "Abstract": "In case of spacetimes with single horizon, there exist several well-established procedures for relating the surface gravity of the horizon to a thermodynamic temperature. Such procedures, however, cannot be extended in a straightforward manner when a spacetime has multiple horizons. In particular, it is not clear whether there exists a notion of global temperature characterizing the multi-horizon spacetimes. We examine the conditions under which a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using the example of Schwarzschild-De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically extend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor, response of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for identifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the SDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart which covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a consistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS spacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two temperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS spacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational (c) Even when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal nature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate chart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other charts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures. The coordinate dependence of the thermal nature is reminiscent of the flat spacetime in Minkowski and Rindler coordinate charts. The implications are discussed."

        "Abstract": "Atom-in-jellium calculations of the Einstein frequency were used to calculate the mean displacement of an ion over a wide range of compression and temperature. Expressed as a fraction of the Wigner-Seitz radius, the displacement is a measure of the asymptotic freedom of the ion at high temperature, and thus of the change in heat capacity from 6 to 3 quadratic degrees of freedom per atom. A functional form for free energy was proposed based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as a correction to the Debye free energy, with a single free parameter representing the effective density of potential modes to be saturated. This parameter was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations, and found to be ~0.2 per atom. In this way, the ion-thermal contribution can be calculated for a wide-range equation of state (EOS) without requiring a large number of molecular dynamics simulations. Example calculations were performed for carbon, including the sensitivity of key EOS loci to ionic freedom."

Recasting a network at higher scales can have useful effects, such as decreasing the uncertainty in the movement of random walkers across the network while also decreasing the size of the network. However, the task of finding such a macroscale representation is computationally difficult, as the set of all possible scales of a network grows exponentially with the number of nodes. Here we compare various methods for finding the most informative scale of a network, discovering that an approach based on spectral analysis outperforms greedy and gradient descent-based methods. We then use this procedure to show how several structural properties of preferential attachment networks vary across scales. We describe how meso- and macroscale representations of networks can have significant benefits over their underlying microscale, which include properties such as increase in determinism, a decrease in degeneracy, a lower entropy rate of random walkers on the network, an increase in global network efficiency, and higher values for a variety of centrality measures than the microscale."

The theory is based on the chord function, i.e. the Fourier transform of the Wigner function. It reduces to an exact solution of the Lindblad master equation if the hamiltonian operator is a quadratic function and the Lindblad operators are linear functions of positions and momenta.   Initially, the semiclassical formulae for the case of hermitian Lindblad operators are reinterpreted in terms of a (real) double phase space, generated by an appropriate classical double Hamiltonian. An extra \"open\" term is added to the double Hamiltonian by the non-hermitian part of the Lindblad operators in the general case of dissipative markovian evolution. The particular case of generic hamiltonian operators, but linear dissipative Lindblad operators, is studied in more detail. A Liouville-type equivariance still holds for the corresponding classical evolution in double phase, but the centre subspace, which supports the Wigner function, is compressed, along with expansion of its conjugate subspace, which supports the chord function.   Decoherence narrows the relevant region of double phase space to the neighborhood of a caustic for both the Wigner function and the chord function. This difficulty is avoided by a propagator in a mixed representation, so that a further \"small-chord\" approximation leads to a simple generalization of the quadratic theory for evolving Wigner functions."

We derive the cores' physical parameters and discuss the relation between the mass, temperature, density, size and the surrounding interstellar radiation field (ISRF) for the cores. The masses of the cores were found not to correlate with their radial size or central density. The temperature at the surface of a core was seen to depend almost entirely on the level of the ISRF surrounding the core.

        "Abstract": "The division of galaxies into ``barred'' (SB) and ``normal'' (S) spirals is a fundamental aspect of the Hubble galaxy classification system. This ``tuning fork'' view was revised by de Vaucouleurs, whose classification volume recognized apparent ``bar strength'' (SA, SAB, SB) as a continuous property of galaxies called the ``family''. However, the SA, SAB, and SB families are purely visual judgments that can have little bearing on the actual bar strength in a given galaxy. Until very recently, published bar judgments were based exclusively on blue light images, where internal extinction or star formation can either mask a bar completely or give the false impression of a bar in a nonbarred galaxy. Near-infrared camera arrays, which principally trace the old stellar populations in both normal and barred galaxies, now facilitate a quantification of bar strength in terms of their gravitational potentials and force fields. In this paper, we show that the maximum value, Qb, of the ratio of the tangential force to the mean radial force is a quantitative measure of the strength of a bar. Qb does not measure bar ellipticity or bar shape, but rather depends on the actual forcing due to the bar embedded in its disk. We show that a wide range of true bar strengths characterizes the category ``SB'', while de Vaucouleurs category ``SAB'' corresponds to a much narrower range of bar strengths. We present Qb values for 36 galaxies, and we incorporate our bar classes into a dust-penetrated classification system for spiral galaxies."

The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

Then the classical theorem of Frobenius would characterize the complete integrability of a vector sub-bundle of the tangent bundle by a zero curvature tensor in the sense of our definition here. A basic tool is a result about the curvature tensor of the natural lift of the vector sub-bundle to a manifold of maps with values in the base of that sub-bundle. Another is a localization property for a Lie algebra of vector fields over this manifold of maps.These allow to prove an additive formula for the curvature tensors of two supplementary sub-bundles. The main result consists in identifying a natural linear parallel transport on a supplementary vector sub-bundle along any tangent path to the vector sub-bundle under study, which is the right generalization of a linear connection parallel transport on a vector bundle along the projection in the base of that path. Then we derive the differential equation of the quotient of respective parallel transport operators induced by two different supplementary sub-bundles to the sub-bundle in question in terms of its curvature. Using this we obtain the equation of the infinitesimal variation of tangent paths to a vector sub-bundle, defined by its curvature, that appears as the root for the Jacobi equation of the infinitesimal variation of geodesics."

The model comprises a 1-level bridge representing a molecular level that connects between two free electron reservoirs and is coupled to a vibrational degree of freedom representing a molecular vibrational mode. The latter in turn is coupled to a phonon bath that represents the thermal environment. We focus on the zero frequency noise spectrum and study the changes in its behavior under weak and strong electron-phonon interactions. In the weak coupling regime we find that the noise amplitude can increase or decrease as a result of opening of an inelastic channel, depending on distance from resonance and on junction asymmetry. In particular the relative Fano factor decreases with increasing off resonance distance and junction asymmetry. For resonant inelastic tunneling with strong electron-phonon coupling the differential noise spectrum can show phonon sidebands in addition to a central feature. Such sidebands can be observed when displaying the noise against the source-drain voltage, but not in noise vs. gate voltage plots obtained at low source-drain bias. A striking crossover of the central feature from double to single peak is found for increasing asymmetry in the molecule-leads coupling or increasing electron-phonon interaction. These variations provide a potential diagnostic tool. A possible use of noise data from scanning tunneling microscopy experiments for estimating the magnitude of the electron-phonon interaction on the bridge is proposed."

We use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero during initial inflationary cosmology, and obtain a sound speed approaching unity as the slope of the scalar field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All this is to aid in a data reconstruction problem of how to account for the initial origins of CMB due to dark matter since effective field theories as presently constructed require a cut off value for applicability of their potential structure. This is often at the cost of, especially in early universe theoretical models, of clearly defined baryogenesis, and of a well defined mechanism of phase transitions."

Indications exist that the gravitational mass of Alpha Cen B could be higher than its modeled mass, the difference being consistent with a substellar companion of a few tens of Jupiter masses. However, Alpha Centauri usually appears in star catalogues surrounded by a large void area, due to the strong diffused light. Aims: We searched for faint comoving companions to Alpha Cen located at angular distances of the order of a few tens of arcseconds, up to 2-3 arcmin. As a secondary objective, we built a catalogue of the detected background sources. Methods: In order to complement our adaptive optics search at small angular distances (Paper I), we used atmosphere limited CCD imaging from the NTT-SUSI2 instrument in the Bessel V, R, I, and Z bands.

This has help us to clarify and extend several aspects of their dynamics. We have found that the decay of winding states into non-winding states behaving like a gas of ordinary non-relativistic particles precludes the existence of a late expansion phase of the universe and obstructs the growth of three large spatial dimensions as we observe today. We propose a generic solution to this problem by considering the dynamics of a gas of non-static branes. We have also obtained a simple criterion on the initial conditions to ensure the small string coupling approximation along the whole dynamical evolution, and consequently, the consistency of an effective low-energy description.

        "Abstract": "The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) spacecraft observed the X-ray pulsar GX 1+4 for a period of 34 hours on July 19/20 1996. The source faded from an intensity of ~20 mCrab to a minimum of <~0.7 mCrab and then partially recovered towards the end of the observation. This extended minimum lasted ~40,000 seconds. Phase folded light curves at a barycentric rotation period of 124.36568 +/- 0.00020 seconds show that near the center of the extended minimum the source stopped pulsing in the traditional sense but retained a weak dip feature at the rotation period. Away from the extended minimum the dips are progressively narrower at higher energies and may be interpreted as obscurations or eclipses of the hot spot by the accretion column. The pulse profile changed from leading-edge bright before the extended minimum to trailing-edge bright after it. Data from the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) show that a torque reversal occurred <10 days after our observation. Our data indicate that the observed rotation departs from a constant period with a Pdot/P value of ~-1.5% per year at a 4.5 sigma significance. We infer that we may have serendipitously obtained data, with high sensitivity and temporal resolution about the time of an accretion disk spin reversal. We also observed a rapid flare which had some precursor activity, close to the center of the extended minimum."

        "Title": "Work and heat fluctuations in two-state systems: a trajectory  thermodynamics formalism",
        "Abstract": "Two-state models provide phenomenological descriptions of many different systems, ranging from physics to chemistry and biology. We investigate work fluctuations in an ensemble of two-state systems driven out of equilibrium under the action of an external perturbation. We calculate the probability density P(W) that a work equal to W is exerted upon the system along a given non-equilibrium trajectory and introduce a trajectory thermodynamics formalism to quantify work fluctuations in the large-size limit. We then define a trajectory entropy S(W) that counts the number of non-equilibrium trajectories P(W)=exp(S(W)/kT) with work equal to W. A trajectory free-energy F(W) can also be defined, which has a minimum at a value of the work that has to be efficiently sampled to quantitatively test the Jarzynski equality. Within this formalism a Lagrange multiplier is also introduced, the inverse of which plays the role of a trajectory temperature. Our solution for P(W) exactly satisfies the fluctuation theorem by Crooks and allows us to investigate heat-fluctuations for a protocol that is invariant under time reversal. The heat distribution is then characterized by a Gaussian component (describing small and frequent heat exchange events) and exponential tails (describing the statistics of large deviations and rare events). For the latter, the width of the exponential tails is related to the aforementioned trajectory temperature. Finite-size effects to the large-N theory and the recovery of work distributions for finite N are also discussed. Finally, we pay particular attention to the case of magnetic nanoparticle systems under the action of a magnetic field H where work and heat fluctuations are predicted to be observable in ramping experiments in micro-SQUIDs."

        "Abstract": "We develop a Genetic Programming-based methodology that enables discovery of novel functional forms for classical inter-atomic force-fields, used in molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike previous efforts in the field, that fit only the parameters to the fixed functional forms, we instead use a novel algorithm to search the space of many possible functional forms. While a follow-on practical procedure will use experimental and {\\it ab inito} data to find an optimal functional form for a forcefield, we first validate the approach using a manufactured solution. This validation has the advantage of a well-defined metric of success. We manufactured a training set of atomic coordinate data with an associated set of global energies using the well-known Lennard-Jones inter-atomic potential. We performed an automatic functional form fitting procedure starting with a population of random functions, using a genetic programming functional formulation, and a parallel tempering Metropolis-based optimization algorithm. Our massively-parallel method independently discovered the Lennard-Jones function after searching for several hours on 100 processors and covering a miniscule portion of the configuration space. We find that the method is suitable for unsupervised discovery of functional forms for inter-atomic potentials/force-fields. We also find that our parallel tempering Metropolis-based approach significantly improves the optimization convergence time, and takes good advantage of the parallel cluster architecture."

We notice that the intrinsic parameters of a typical superinductor in fact place it into the Bose glass universality class for which the propagation of waves in a sufficiently long chain is hindered by pinning. Its weakness provides for a broad crossover from the spectrum of well-resolved plasmon standing waves at high frequencies to the low-frequency excitation spectrum of a pinned charge density wave. We relate the scattering amplitude of microwave photons reflected off a superinductor to the dynamics of a Bose glass. The dynamics at long and short scales compared to the Larkin pinning length determines the low- and high-frequency asymptotes of the reflection amplitude."

        "Title": "Heating and Cooling of Hot Accretion Flows by Non Local Radiation",
        "Abstract": "We consider non-local effects which arise when radiation emitted at one radius of an accretion disk either heats or cools gas at other radii through Compton scattering. We discuss three situations:   1. Radiation from the inner regions of an advection-dominated flow Compton cooling gas at intermediate radii and Compton heating gas at large radii.   2. Soft radiation from an outer thin accretion disk Compton cooling a hot one- or two-temperature flow on the inside.   3. Soft radiation from an inner thin accretion disk Compton cooling hot gas in a surrounding one-temperature flow.   We describe how previous results are modified by these non-local interactions. We find that Compton heating or cooling of the gas by the radiation emitted in the inner regions of a hot flow is not important. Likewise, Compton cooling by the soft photons from an outer thin disk is negligible when the transition from a cold to a hot flow occurs at a radius greater than some minimum $R_{tr,min}$. However, if the hot flow terminates at $R < R_{tr,min}$, non-local cooling is so strong that the hot gas is cooled to a thin disk configuration in a runaway process. In the case of a thin disk surrounded by a hot one-temperature flow, we find that Compton cooling by soft radiation dominates over local cooling in the hot gas for $\\dot{M} \\gsim 10^{-3} \\alpha \\dot{M}_{Edd}$, and $R \\lsim 10^4 R_{Schw}$. As a result, the maximum accretion rate for which an advection-dominated one-temperature solution exists, decreases by a factor of $\\sim 10$, compared to the value computed under an assumption of local energy balance."

        "Abstract": "Conventional turbo codes (CTCs) usually employ a block-oriented interleaving so that each block is separately encoded and decoded. As interleaving and de-interleaving are performed within a block, the message-passing process associated with an iterative decoder is limited to proceed within the corresponding range. This paper presents a new turbo coding scheme that uses a special interleaver structure and a multiple-round early termination test involving both sign check and a CRC code. The new interleaver structure is naturally suited for high speed parallel processing and the resulting coding system offers new design options and tradeoffs that are not available to CTCs. In particular, it becomes possible for the decoder to employ an efficient inter-block collaborative decoding algorithm, passing the information obtained from termination test proved blocks to other unproved blocks. It also becomes important to have a proper decoding schedule. The combined effect is improved performance and reduction in the average decoding delay (whence the required computing power). A memory (storage) management mechanism is included as a critical part of the decoder so as to provide additional design tradeoff between performance and memory size. It is shown that the latter has a modular-like effect in that additional memory units render enhanced performance due not only to less forced early terminations but to possible increases of the interleaving depth. Depending on the decoding schedule, the degree of parallelism and other decoding resources available, the proposed scheme admits a variety of decoder architectures that meet a large range of throughput and performance demands."

        "Title": "3D Model Assisted Image Segmentation",
        "Abstract": "The problem of segmenting a given image into coherent regions is important in Computer Vision and many industrial applications require segmenting a known object into its components. Examples include identifying individual parts of a component for process control work in a manufacturing plant and identifying parts of a car from a photo for automatic damage detection. Unfortunately most of an object's parts of interest in such applications share the same pixel characteristics, having similar colour and texture. This makes segmenting the object into its components a non-trivial task for conventional image segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a \"Model Assisted Segmentation\" method to tackle this problem. A 3D model of the object is registered over the given image by optimising a novel gradient based loss function. This registration obtains the full 3D pose from an image of the object. The image can have an arbitrary view of the object and is not limited to a particular set of views. The segmentation is subsequently performed using a level-set based method, using the projected contours of the registered 3D model as initialisation curves. The method is fully automatic and requires no user interaction. Also, the system does not require any prior training. We present our results on photographs of a real car."

We discuss the case of $^{1}$S$_{0}$ calcium atoms in an optical dipole trap (ODT), however, similar strategies should be applicable to a wide range of atomic species. Our starting point is a reservoir of moderately cold ($\\approx 300 \\mu$K) metastable $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms prepared by means of a magneto-optic trap (triplet-MOT). A focused 532 nm laser beam produces a strongly elongated optical potential for $^{1}$S$_{0}$-atoms with up to 350 $\\mu$K well depth. A weak focused laser beam at 430 nm, carefully superimposed upon the ODT beam, selectively pumps the $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms inside the capture volume to the singlet state, where they are confined by the ODT. The triplet-MOT perpetually refills the capture volume with $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms thus providing a continuous stream of cold atoms into the ODT at a rate of $10^7 $s$^{-1}$. Limited by evaporation loss, in 200 ms we typically load $5 \\times 10^5$ atoms with an initial radial temperature of 85 $\\mu$K.

A closer look at the system's allowed optical transitions as a function of PhAT rates showed coalescence of the transition energies, leading to a loss of spectroscopic resolution in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. This coalescence occurs at several exceptional points, suggesting a quantum dynamical phase transition."

If such a process is possible, then this would be a potential violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, we find that, analogous to Wald's result for a single charged black hole, such a test particle which can expose the singularity, would not be able to enter the horizon. This provides an interesting and non-trivial example that supports the validity of the cosmic censorship hypothesis in four-dimensional general relativity."

According to Kohn's theorem, the frequency of this collective mode is not affected by an interaction between the atoms and is always equal to the trap frequency. This remarkable property, however, does not necessarily hold in an approximate theory. We explicitly prove that the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA), including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels, is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory developed by Nozi\\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\\it depend} on the strength of effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance."

        "Abstract": "A single atom in a cavity is the model system of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). The strong coupling regime between the atom and cavity-confined photon corresponds to the reversible exchange of energy between the two modes, and underpins a wide range of CQED phenomena with applications in quantum information science, including for example as quantum logic gates and as sources of entangled states. An important advance was achieved recently when strong coupling between excitons and cavity photons was reported for the first time for localized quantum dots (QDs) in micron-size solid state cavities. This has significance in terms of scalability and integration with other optical devices, and could lead to the emergence of \"quantum optics on a chip\" technology. However the results presented so far for quantum dots are in the linear regime, corresponding to coupling to the vacuum field (vacuum Rabi splitting); they are not a true QED effect and can equally well be described by classical physics as the coupling between two oscillators. In this paper, we present evidence for a purely quantum phenomenon for the QD/cavity photon system, namely the increase in splitting of the levels when the mean number of photons in the cavity is increased. This corresponds to non-linearities on the single-photon scale: the presence of a single excitation in the cavity changes the level structure, affecting the emission energies for a second photon. Such results are a first step in demonstrating the promise of quantum dots for CQED applications."

No stationarity assumption is made. However, in order for the theorem to apply, the horizon topology must be unchanging for long enough to admit a certain kind of cross section. We expect this condition is generically satisfied if the topology is unchanging for much longer than the light-crossing time of the black hole. More precisely, let $M$ be a four dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime satisfying the averaged null energy condition, and suppose that the domain of outer communication $\\C_K$ to the future of a cut $K$ of $\\Sm$ is globally hyperbolic. Suppose further that a Cauchy surface $\\Sigma$ for $\\C_K$ is a topological 3-manifold with compact boundary $\\partial\\S$ in $M$, and $\\S'$ is a compact submanifold of $\\bS$ with spherical boundary in $\\S$ (and possibly other boundary components in $M/\\S$).

These examples illustrate the formal structure of thermodynamics developed by Callen as applied to a gravitational configuration as well as the phenomenological manner in which Einstein equations largely determine the thermodynamical equations of state. We consider in detail the thermodynamics and quasi-static collapse of a self-gravitating shell. This includes a discussion of intrinsic stability for a one-parameter family of thermal equations of state and the interpretation of the Bekenstein bound. The entropy growth associated with a collapsing sequence of equilibrium states of a shell is computed under different boundary conditions in the quasi-static approximation and compared with black hole entropy. Although explicit expressions involve empirical coefficients, these are constrained by physical conditions of thermodynamical origin. The absence of a Gibbs-Duhem relation and the associated scaling laws for self-gravitating matter systems are presented."

Stability with respect to gauge perturbations depends on a choice of gauge and a background metric, but it does not depend on a particular form of a 3+1 system if its constrained solutions are equivalent to those of the Einstein equations. Stability of a number of known gauges is investigated in the limit of short-wavelength perturbations. All fixed gauges except a synchronous gauge are found to be ill-posed. A maximal slicing gauge and its parabolic extension are shown to be ill-posed as well. A necessary condition is derived for well-posedness of metric-dependent algebraic gauges. Well-posed metric-dependent gauges are found, however, to be generally unstable. Both instability and ill-posedness are associated with perturbations of physical accelerations of reference frames."

We find that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion stabilizes a regime of charged meron-antimeron vortex soliton pairs over a region of doping from 0.05 to 0.4 holes per site for intermediate coupling 3 < U/t <8. This stabilization is mediated through the generation of ``spin-flux'' in the mean-field antiferromagnetic (AFM) background. Holes cloaked by a meron-vortex in the spin-flux AFM background are charged bosons. Our static Hartree-Fock calculations provide an upper bound on the energy of a finite density of charged vortices. This upper bound is lower than the energy of the corresponding charged stripe configurations. A finite density of charge carrying vortices is shown to produce a large number of unoccupied electronic levels in the Mott-Hubbard charge transfer gap. These levels lead to significant band tailing and a broad mid-infrared band in the optical absorption spectrum as observed experimentally. At very low doping (below 0.05) the doping charges create extremely tightly bound meron-antimeron pairs or even isolated conventional spin-polarons, whereas for very high doping (above 0.4) the spin background itself becomes unstable to formation of a conventional Fermi liquid and the spin-flux mean-field is energetically unfavorable. Our results point to the predominance of a quantum liquid of charged, bosonic, vortex solitons at intermediate coupling and intermediate doping concentrations."

        "Abstract": "The ``warp drive'' metric recently presented by Alcubierre has the problem that an observer at the center of the warp bubble is causally separated from the outer edge of the bubble wall. Hence such an observer can neither create a warp bubble on demand nor control one once it has been created. In addition, such a bubble requires negative energy densities. One might hope that elimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that although the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In our four dimensional extension of this metric, a ``tube'' is constructed along the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star. Inside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to allow superluminal travel in one direction. We show that, although a single Krasnikov tube does not involve closed timelike curves, a time machine can be constructed with a system of two non-overlapping tubes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Krasnikov tubes, like warp bubbles and traversable wormholes, also involve unphysically thin layers of negative energy density, as well as large total negative energies, and therefore probably cannot be realized in practice."

        "Title": "Characterizing Variable Stars in a Single Night with LSST",
        "Abstract": "Stars exhibit a bewildering variety of variable behaviors ranging from explosive magnetic flares to stochastically changing accretion to periodic pulsations or rotations. The principal LSST surveys will have cadences too sparse and irregular to capture most of these phenomena. A novel idea is proposed here to observe a single Galactic field, rich in unobscured stars, in a continuous sequence of $\\sim 15$ second exposures for one long winter night in a single photometric band. The result will be a unique dataset of $\\sim 1$ million regularly spaced stellar lightcurves. The lightcurves will gives a particularly comprehensive collection of dM star variability. A powerful array of statistical procedures can be applied to the ensemble of lightcurves from the long-standing fields of time series analysis, signal processing and econometrics. Dozens of `features' describing the variability can be extracted and subject to machine learning classification, giving a unique authoritative objective classification of rapidly variable stars. The most effective features can then inform the wider LSST community on the best approaches to variable star identification and classification from the sparse, irregular cadences that dominate the LSST project."

        "Abstract": "In this paper we present the observational campaign carried out at ESO NTT and VLT in April and May 2006 to investigate the nature and the structure of the Near Earth Object (144898) 2004 VD17. In spite of a great quantity of dynamical information, according to which it will have a close approach with the Earth in the next century, the physical properties of this asteroid are largely unknown. We performed visible and near--infrared photometry and spectroscopy, as well as polarimetric observations. Polarimetric and spectroscopic data allowed us to classify 2004 VD17 as an E-type asteroid. A good agreement was also found with the spectrum of the aubrite meteorite Mayo Belwa. On the basis of the polarimetric albedo (p_v=0.45) and of photometric data, we estimated a diameter of about 320 m and a rotational period of about 2 hours. The analysis of the results obtained by our complete survey have shown that (144898) 2004 VD17 is a peculiar NEO, since it is close to the breakup limits for fast rotator asteroids, as defined by Pravec and Harris (2000). These results suggest that a more robust structure must be expected, as a fractured monolith or a rubble pile in a \"strength regime\" (Holsapple 2002)."

        "Abstract": "We study the thermalization, after sudden and slow quenches, of an interacting model having a quantum phase transition from a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) non-Fermi liquid (NFL) to a Fermi liquid (FL). The model has SYK fermions coupled to non-interacting lead fermions and can be realized in a graphene flake connected to external leads. After a sudden quench to the NFL, a thermal state is reached rapidly via collapse-revival oscillations of the quasiparticle residue of the lead fermions. In contrast, the quench to the FL, across the NFL-FL transition, leads to multiple prethermal regimes and much slower thermalization. In the slow quench performed over a time $\\tau$, we find that the excitation energy generated has a remarkable intermediate-$\\tau$ non-analytic power-law dependence, $\\tau^{-\\eta}$ with $\\eta<1$, which seemingly masks the dynamical manifestation of the initial residual entropy of the SYK fermions. The power-law scaling is expected to eventually break down for $\\tau\\to\\infty$, signaling a violation of adiabaticity, due to the residual entropy present in the SYK fermions."

        "Abstract": "Deep UBVI photometry for a large field covering the distant globular cluster M75 (NGC 6864) is presented. We confirm a previous suggestion (Catelan et al. 1998a) that M75 possesses a bimodal horizontal branch (HB) bearing striking resemblance to the well-known case of NGC 1851. In addition, we detect a third, smaller grouping of stars on the M75 blue tail, separated from the bulk of the blue HB stars by a gap spanning about 0.5 mag in V. Such a group of stars may correspond to the upper part of a very extended, though thinly populated, blue tail. Thus M75 appears to have a trimodal HB. The presence of the \"Grundahl jump\" is verified using the broadband U filter. We explore the color-magnitude diagram of M75 with the purpose of deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, and find a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.03 +/- 0.17 dex and -1.24 +/- 0.21 dex in the Carretta & Gratton (1997) and Zinn & West (1984) scales, respectively. We discuss earlier suggestions that the cluster has an anomalously low ratio of bright red giants to HB stars. A differential age analysis with respect to NGC 1851 suggests that the two clusters are essentially coeval."

Beginning with a few simple examples, a simple approach to predict P(I)'s, angular momenta I ground state (g.s.) probabilities, of a few solvable cases, such as fermions in a small single-j shell and d boson systems, is given. This method is generalized to predict P(I)'s of more complicated cases, such as even or odd number of fermions in a large single-j shell or a many-j shell, d-boson, sd-boson or sdg-boson systems, etc. By this method we are able to tell which interactions are essential to produce a sizable P(I) in a many-body system. The g.s. probability of maximum angular momentum $I_{max}$ is discussed. An argument on the microscopic foundation of our approach, and certain matrix elements which are useful to understand the observed regularities, are also given or addressed in detail. The low seniority chain of 0 g.s. by using the same set of two-body interactions is confirmed but it is noted that contribution to the total 0 g.s. probability beyond this chain may be more important for even fermions in a single-j shell. Preliminary results by taking a displaced two-body random ensemble are presented for the I g.s. probabilities."

For $\\alpha \\leq 1$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, we say that a graph $G=(V,E)$ is $\\alpha$-partially $k$-colorable, if there exists a subset $S\\subset V$ of cardinality $ |S | \\geq \\alpha | V |$ such that the graph induced on $S$ is $k$-colorable. Partial $k$-colorability is a more robust structural property of a graph than $k$-colorability. For graphs that arise in practice, partial $k$-colorability might be a better notion to use than $k$-colorability, since data arising in practice often contains various forms of noise.   We give a polynomial time algorithm that takes as input a $(1 - \\epsilon)$-partially $3$-colorable graph $G$ and a constant $\\gamma \\in [\\epsilon, 1/10]$, and colors a $(1 - \\epsilon/\\gamma)$ fraction of the vertices using $\\tilde{O}\\left(n^{0.25 + O(\\gamma^{1/2})} \\right)$ colors.

        "Abstract": "We present a hybrid method for the simulation of colloidal systems, that combines molecular dynamics (MD) with the Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) scheme. The LB method is used as a model for the solvent in order to take into account the hydrodynamic mass and momentum transport through the solvent. The colloidal particles are propagated via MD and they are coupled to the LB fluid by viscous forces. With respect to the LB fluid, the colloids are represented by uniformly distributed points on a sphere. Each such point (with a velocity V(r) at any off-lattice position r is interacting with the neighboring eight LB nodes by a frictional force F=\\xi_0(V(r)-u(r)) with \\xi_0 being a friction force and u(r) being the velocity of the fluid at the position r. Thermal fluctuations are introduced in the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics. This coupling scheme has been proposed recently for polymer systems by Ahlrichs and D\"unweg [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 8225 (1999)]. We investigate several properties of a single colloidal particle in a LB fluid, namely the effective Stokes friction and long time tails in the autocorrelation functions for the translational and rotational velocity. Moreover, a charged colloidal system is considered consisting of a macroion, counterions and coions that are coupled to a LB fluid. We study the behavior of the ions in a constant electric field. In particular, an estimate of the effective charge of the macroion is yielded from the number of counterions that move with the macroion in the direction of the electric field."

We consider a family of commuting Hermitian operators $a(\\Delta)$ indexed by all measurable, relatively compact sets $\\Delta$ in $X$ (a quantum stochastic process over $X$). For such a family, we introduce the notion of a correlation measure. We prove that, if the family of operators possesses a correlation measure which satisfies some condition of growth, then there exists a point process over $X$ having the same correlation measure. Furthermore, the operators $a(\\Delta)$ can be realized as multiplication operators in the $L^2$-space with respect to this point process. In the proof, we utilize the notion of $\\star$-positive definiteness, proposed in [Y. G. Kondratiev and T.\\ Kuna, {\\it Infin. Dimens. Anal. Quantum Probab. Relat. Top.} {\\bf 5} (2002), 201--233]. In particular, our result extends the criterion of existence of a point process from that paper to the case of the topological space $X$, which is a standard underlying space in the theory of point processes. As applications, we discuss particle densities of the quasi-free representations of the CAR and CCR, which lead to fermion, boson, fermion-like, and boson-like (e.g. para-fermions and para-bosons of order 2) point processes.   In particular, we prove that any fermion point process corresponding to a Hermitian kernel may be derived in this way."

Our analysis uses semidefinite programming in the coherent state framework and aims at simultaneously optimizing over the noise and losses introduced by a dishonest party.

We then turn our attention specifically to those models for which the exact distribution of microstates in the steady state can be expressed in a matrix product form. In addition to a gentle introduction to this matrix product approach, how it works and how it relates to similar constructions that arise in other physical contexts, we present a unified, pedagogical account of the various means by which the statistical mechanical calculations of macroscopic physical quantities are actually performed. We also review a number of more advanced topics, including nonequilibrium free energy functionals, the classification of exclusion processes involving multiple particle species, existence proofs of a matrix product state for a given model and more complicated variants of the matrix product state that allow various types of parallel dynamics to be handled.

        "Abstract": "An important challenge in human robot interaction (HRI) is enabling non-expert users to specify complex tasks for autonomous robots. Recently, active preference learning has been applied in HRI to interactively shape a robot's behaviour. We study a framework where users specify constraints on allowable robot movements on a graphical interface, yielding a robot task specification. However, users may not be able to accurately assess the impact of such constraints on the performance of a robot. Thus, we revise the specification by iteratively presenting users with alternative solutions where some constraints might be violated, and learn about the importance of the constraints from the users' choices between these alternatives. We demonstrate our framework in a user study with a material transport task in an industrial facility. We show that nearly all users accept alternative solutions and thus obtain a revised specification through the learning process, and that the revision leads to a substantial improvement in robot performance. Further, the learning process reduces the variances between the specifications from different users and thus makes the specifications more similar. As a result, the users whose initial specifications had the largest impact on performance benefit the most from the interactive learning."

We present the newest results of our laboratory experiment investigating \"rigid\" coronagraph with a binary shaped checkerboard pupil mask, which should offer a highly stable solution for telescopes without adaptive optics (AO) for wavefront correction in space missions. The primary aim of this work was to study the stability of the coronagraph, and to demonstrate its performance without adaptive wavefront correction. Estimation of both the raw contrast and the gain of the point spread function (PSF) subtraction were needed. The limiting factor of the contrast was also important. A binary shaped pupil mask of a checkerboard type has been designed. The mask, consisting of an aluminum film on a glass substrate, was manufactured using nano-fabrication techniques with electron beam lithography. Careful evaluation of coronagraphic performance, including PSF subtraction, was carried out in air using the developed mask. A contrast of $6.7 \\times 10^{-8}$ was achieved for the raw coronagraphic image by areal averaging of all of the observed dark regions. Following PSF subtraction, the contrast reached $6.8 \\times 10^{-9}$. Speckles were a major limiting factor throughout the dark regions of both the raw image and the PSF subtracted image. A rigid coronagraph with PSF subtraction without AO is a useful method to achieve high contrast observations. Applications of a rigid coronagraph to a Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) and other platforms are discussed."

The method uses a spectral representation for the total electrostatic energy of the composite. The force is expressed as a certain gradient of this energy, which can be expressed in a closed analytic form rather than evaluated as a numerical derivative. The method is applicable even when both the spheres and the host have frequency-dependent dielectric functions and nonzero conductivities, provided the system is in the quasistatic regime. In principle, it includes all multipolar contributions to the force, and it can be used to calculate multi-body as well as pairwise forces. We also present several numerical examples, including host fluids with finite conductivities. The force between spheres approaches the dipole-dipole limit, as expected, at large separations, but departs drastically from that limit when the spheres are nearly in contact. The force may also change sign as a function of frequency when the host is a slightly conducting fluid."

        "Abstract": "The division of galaxies into ``barred'' (SB) and ``normal'' (S) spirals is a fundamental aspect of the Hubble galaxy classification system. This ``tuning fork'' view was revised by de Vaucouleurs, whose classification volume recognized apparent ``bar strength'' (SA, SAB, SB) as a continuous property of galaxies called the ``family''. However, the SA, SAB, and SB families are purely visual judgments that can have little bearing on the actual bar strength in a given galaxy. Until very recently, published bar judgments were based exclusively on blue light images, where internal extinction or star formation can either mask a bar completely or give the false impression of a bar in a nonbarred galaxy. Near-infrared camera arrays, which principally trace the old stellar populations in both normal and barred galaxies, now facilitate a quantification of bar strength in terms of their gravitational potentials and force fields. In this paper, we show that the maximum value, Qb, of the ratio of the tangential force to the mean radial force is a quantitative measure of the strength of a bar. Qb does not measure bar ellipticity or bar shape, but rather depends on the actual forcing due to the bar embedded in its disk. We show that a wide range of true bar strengths characterizes the category ``SB'', while de Vaucouleurs category ``SAB'' corresponds to a much narrower range of bar strengths. We present Qb values for 36 galaxies, and we incorporate our bar classes into a dust-penetrated classification system for spiral galaxies."

We mainly consider as background a pump beam with well-defined wave vector and polarization. This leads us to define a nonlinear index of vacuum which, in the Euler-Heisenberg model derived from QED, has an optimal value of $1.555 \\times 10^{-33} \\, {\\rm cm}^{2}/{\\rm W}$ for a linearly polarized pump as seen by a counter-propagating, orthogonally polarized probe. We further generalize the model to include coupling to an axion field. In the limit where the axion mass is much smaller than the typical photon energy, this yields dispersive corrections, and the axionic signature is found to be greatly enhanced for a circularly polarized pump as compared to a linearly polarized one. The formalism here presented points to a simplification of the DeLLight experiment [X. Sarazin et al., Eur. Phys. J.

Our model manages to preserve all other visual attributes of a real face, such as head orientation, even though this and other attributes are not labeled in either real or synthetic domain. Since our model learns to manipulate a specific property in isolation using only \"synthetic demonstrations\" of such manipulations without explicitly provided labels, it can be applied to shape, texture, lighting, and other properties that are difficult to measure or represent as real-valued vectors. We measure the degree to which our model preserves other attributes of a real image when a single specific attribute is manipulated. We use digit datasets to analyze how discrepancy in attribute distributions affects the performance of our model, and demonstrate results in a far more difficult setting: learning to manipulate real human faces using nonphotorealistic 3D renders."

For example during flight, an aircraft's modal properties are known to change with both altitude and velocity. It is thus important to quantify these changes given only a truncated set of modal data, which is usually the case experimentally. This procedure is formally known as the generalised inverse eigenvalue problem. In this paper we experimentally show that first-order gradient-based methods that optimise objective functions defined over a modal are prohibitive due to the required small step sizes. This in turn leads to the justification of using a non-gradient, black box optimiser in the form of particle swarm optimisation. We further show how it is possible to solve such inverse eigenvalue problems in a lower dimensional space by the use of random projections, which in many cases reduces the total dimensionality of the optimisation problem by 80% to 99%. Two example problems are explored involving a ten-dimensional mass-stiffness toy problem, and a one-dimensional finite element mass-stiffness approximation for a Boeing 737-300 aircraft."

After a review of the fundamental features characterizing the inflationary model, as referred to a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, we develop a generalization in view of including small inhomogeneous corrections in the theory. A second step in our discussion is devoted to show that the inflationary scenario provides a valuable dynamical ``bridge'' between a generic Kasner-like regime and a homogeneous and isotropic Universe in the horizon scale. This result is achieved by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a Bianchi IX model in the presence of a cosmological space-dependent term. In this respect, we construct a quasi-isotropic inflationary solution based on the expansion of the Einstein equations up to first-two orders of approximation, in which the isotropy of the Universe is due to the dominance of the scalar field kinetic term; the first order of approximation corresponds to the inhomogeneous corrections and is driven by the matter evolution. We show how such a quasi-isotropic solution contains a certain freedom in fixing the space functions involved in the problem. The main physical issue of this analysis corresponds to outline the impossibility for the classical origin of density perturbations, due to the exponential decay of the matter term during the de Sitter phase."

A direct adaptation of a byte based cipher such as RC4 into a 32- or 64-bit word version will obviously need vast amounts of memory. This scaling issue necessitates a look for new components and principles, as well as mathematical analysis to justify their use. Our approach, like RC4's, is based on rapidly mixing random walks on directed graphs (that is, walks which reach a random state quickly, from any starting point). We begin with some well understood walks, and then introduce nonlinearity in their steps in order to improve security and show long term statistical correlations are negligible. To minimize the short term correlations, as well as to deter attacks using equations involving successive outputs, we provide a method for sequencing the outputs derived from the walk using three revolving buffers. The cipher is fast -- it runs at a speed of less than 5 cycles per byte on a Pentium IV processor. A word based cipher needs to output more bits per step, which exposes more correlations for attacks. Moreover we seek simplicity of construction and transparent analysis. To meet these requirements, we use a larger state and claim security corresponding to only a fraction of it. Our design is for an adequately secure word-based cipher; our very preliminary estimate puts the security close to exhaustive search for keys of size < 256 bits."

The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

This drag force acts in the direction -\\hat V, and arises from the gravitational attraction between the perturber and its wake in the ambient medium. For supersonic motion (M=V/c_s>1), the enhanced-density wake is confined to the Mach cone trailing the perturber; for subsonic motion (M<1), the wake is confined to a sphere of radius c_s t centered a distance V t behind the perturber. Inside the wake, surfaces of constant density are hyperboloids or oblate spheroids for supersonic or subsonic perturbers, respectively, with the density maximal nearest the perturber. The dynamical drag force has the form F_df= - I 4\\pi (G M_p)^2\\rho_0/V^2. We evaluate I analytically; its limits are I\\to M^3/3 for M<<1 and I\\to ln(Vt/r_min) for M>>1. We compare our results to the Chandrasekhar formula for dynamical friction in a collisionless medium, noting that the gaseous drag is generally more efficient when M>1 but less efficient when M<1. To allow simple estimates of orbit evolution in a gaseous protogalaxy or proto-star cluster, we use our formulae to evaluate the decay times of a (supersonic) perturber on a near-circular orbit in an isothermal \\rho\\propto r^{-2} halo, and of a (subsonic) perturber on a near-circular orbit in a constant-density core. We also mention the relevance of our calculations to protoplanet migration in a circumstellar nebula."

The Gauss' law constraint implies that to obtain a physical state, indices of the fermionic matrices must be fully contracted, to form a singlet. There are two ways in which this can be achieved: one can consider a trace basis formed from products of traces of fermionic matrices or one can consider a Schur function basis, labeled by Young diagrams. The Schur polynomials for the fermions involve a twisted character, as a consequence of Fermi statistics. The main result of this paper is a proof that the trace and Schur bases coincide up to a simple normalization coefficient that we have computed."

        "Abstract": "This paper considers the motion planning problem for multiple tethered planar mobile robots. Each robot is attached to a fixed base by a flexible cable. Since the robots share a common workspace, the interactions amongst the robots, cables, and obstacles pose significant difficulties for planning. Previous works have studied the problem of detecting whether a target cable configuration is intersecting (or entangled). Here, we are interested in the motion planning problem: how to plan and coordinate the robot motions to realize a given non-intersecting target cable configuration. We identify four possible modes of motion, depending on whether (i) the robots move in straight lines or following their cable lines; (ii) the robots move sequentially or concurrently. We present an in-depth analysis of Straight & Concurrent, which is the most practically-interesting mode of motion. In particular, we propose algorithms that (a) detect whether a given target cable configuration is realizable by a Straight & Concurrent motion, and (b) return a valid coordinated motion plan. The algorithms are analyzed in detail and validated in simulations and in a hardware experiment."

The proposed system is particularly fit to highly dynamic scenarios, such as vehicular networks, where the network topology changes at a rate which is comparable with the order of magnitude of the delay tolerance. We present an analytical framework able to predict the system performance, in terms of energy consumption, using tools from the theory of point processes, validating it through simulations, and provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed CDMS, in terms of energy consumption and spectrum use. Our performance analysis compares the energy consumption and spectrum use obtained with the proposed scheme with the performance of two benchmark systems. The first one is a plain classic cellular scheme, the second is a D2D data offloading scheme (that we proposed in previous works) in which the D2D transmissions are performed as soon as there is a device with the required content within the maximum D2D transmission range..."

In addition to a master gauge field which contains the massless s=2,4,.. fields, we construct a scalar master field containing the massless s=0 field, the generalized Weyl tensors and their derivatives. We give the appropriate linearized constraint on this master scalar field, which together with a linearized curvature constraint produces the correct linearized field equations. A crucial step in the construction of the theory is the identification of a central generator K which is eliminated by means of a coset construction. Its charge vanishes in the spectrum S, which is the symmetric product of two spin zero doubletons. We expect our results to pave the way for constructing an interacting theory whose curvature expansion is dual to a CFT based on higher spin currents formed out of free doubletons in the large N limit. Thus, extending a recent proposal of Sundborg (hep-th/0103247), we conjecture that the hs(2,2) gauge theory describes a truncation of the bosonic massless sector of tensionless   Type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5 for large N. This implies AdS/CFT correspondence in a parameter regime where both boundary and bulk theories are perturbative."

        "Abstract": "We evaluate from first principles the self-consistent Hartree-Fock energies for multi-soliton configurations in a doped, spin-1/2, antiferromagnetic Mott insulator on a two-dimensional square lattice. We find that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion stabilizes a regime of charged meron-antimeron vortex soliton pairs over a region of doping from 0.05 to 0.4 holes per site for intermediate coupling 3 < U/t <8. This stabilization is mediated through the generation of ``spin-flux'' in the mean-field antiferromagnetic (AFM) background. Holes cloaked by a meron-vortex in the spin-flux AFM background are charged bosons. Our static Hartree-Fock calculations provide an upper bound on the energy of a finite density of charged vortices. This upper bound is lower than the energy of the corresponding charged stripe configurations. A finite density of charge carrying vortices is shown to produce a large number of unoccupied electronic levels in the Mott-Hubbard charge transfer gap. These levels lead to significant band tailing and a broad mid-infrared band in the optical absorption spectrum as observed experimentally. At very low doping (below 0.05) the doping charges create extremely tightly bound meron-antimeron pairs or even isolated conventional spin-polarons, whereas for very high doping (above 0.4) the spin background itself becomes unstable to formation of a conventional Fermi liquid and the spin-flux mean-field is energetically unfavorable. Our results point to the predominance of a quantum liquid of charged, bosonic, vortex solitons at intermediate coupling and intermediate doping concentrations."

The corresponding action functional enables us to establish a complete analytical mechanics for thermomechanical systems: a Lagrangian-Hamiltonian theory, bracket formalism, and Noether's theorem. Furthermore, we apply our procedure iteratively and produce an infinite sequence of interlocked variational principles, a \\emph{variational hierarchy}, where at each level or iteration the full implication of the least action principle can be again shown.

The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

The control of the coherent dynamics is elucidated for the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT), i.e., the coherent dynamics of a driven two-level atom in a quantum superposition state can be brought practically to a complete standstill. We study this phenomenon for different initial preparations of the two-level atom. We then proceed to investigate the decoherence originating from the interaction of the two-level atom with a lossy cavity mode. The loss mechanism is described in terms of a microscopic model that couples the cavity mode to a bath of harmonic field modes. A suitably tuned external cw-laser field applied to the two-level atom slows down considerably the decoherence of the atom. We demonstrate the suppression of decoherence for two opposite initial preparations of the atomic state: a quantum superposition state as well as the ground state. These findings can be used to the effect of a proficient battling of decoherence in qubit manipulation processes."

This free-space optical mixer downconverts the megahertz level amplitude modulation frequencies into the temporal bandwidth of the image sensor.

All modeling assumptions are rigorously explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation. This approach results in a transparent and intuitive model. With respect to the state of the art beam model this paper: (i) proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects, (ii) intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art beam model, and (iii) reduces the number of model parameters, while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data. The proposed beam model is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum likelihood and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization) are proposed to learn the model parameters.   Furthermore, the RBBM is extended to a full scan model in two steps: first, to a full scan model for static environments and next, to a full scan model for general, dynamic environments. The full scan model accounts for the dependency between beams and adapts to the local sample density when using a particle filter. In contrast to Gaussian-based state of the art models, the proposed full scan model uses a sample-based approximation. This sample-based approximation enables handling dynamic environments and capturing multi-modality, which occurs even in simple static environments."

This paper considers the interaction of a pedestrian and an autonomous vehicle at a mid-block, unsignalized intersection where there is ambiguity over when the pedestrian should cross and when and how the vehicle should yield. By modeling pedestrian behavior through the concept of gap acceptance, the authors show that a hybrid controller with just four distinct modes allows an autonomous vehicle to successfully interact with a pedestrian across a continuous spectrum of possible crosswalk entry behaviors. The controller is validated through extensive simulation and compared to an alternate POMDP solution and experimental results are provided on a research vehicle for a virtual pedestrian."

        "Abstract": "A quantum state of an electron influences its electromagnetic field. If a spatial profile of the electron wave packet is not Gaussian, the particle may acquire additional intrinsic multipole moments, which alter its field, especially at small distances. Here the fields of a vortex electron with orbital angular momentum $\\ell$ are obtained in a form of a multipole expansion with an electric quadrupole term kept by using the generalized (non-paraxial) Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The quadrupole contribution arises beyond a paraxial approximation, is linearly enhanced for highly twisted packets with $|\\ell| \\gg 1$, and can be important for the interactions of twisted beams with bulk matter and artificial structures. Moreover, this term results in an azimuthal asymmetry of the magnetic field in a rest frame of the electron, which appears thanks to the spreading of the packet with time. Thus, somewhat contrary to physical intuition, the spreading may enhance non-paraxial phenomena. For the available electron beams, this asymmetry can in principle be reliably detected, which would be experimental evidence of a non-paraxial effect with the vortex electrons."

We present two main results: a complete classification for the approximability of all maximal constraint languages over domains of cardinality at most 4, and a complete classification of the approximability of the problem when the set of allowed constraints contains all permutation constraints. Under the assumption that a conjecture due to Szczepara holds, we give a complete classification for all maximal constraint languages. These classes of languages are well-studied in universal algebra and computer science; they have, for instance, been considered in connection with machine learning and constraint satisfaction.

To do so, we endow the category of prop(erad)s with a model category structure. We provide a complete study of models for prop(erad)s. A new effective method to make minimal models explicit, that extends Koszul duality theory, is introduced and the associated notion is called homotopy Koszul.   As a corollary, we obtain the (co)homology theories of (al)gebras over a prop(erad) and of homotopy (al)gebras as well. Their underlying chain complex is endowed with a canonical Lie algebra up to homotopy structure in general and a Lie algebra structure only in the Koszul case. In particular, we explicit the deformation complex of morphisms from the properad of associative bialgebras. For any minimal model of this properad, the boundary map of this chain complex is shown to be the one defined by Gerstenhaber and Schack. As a corollary, this paper provides a complete proof of the existence of a Lie algebra up to homotopy structure on the Gerstenhaber-Schack bicomplex associated to the deformations of associative bialgebras."

In a canonical formulation the morphology and scaling behavior are accessed by mean of a principle of least action in the asymptotic non-perturbative weak noise limit. The ensuing coupled saddle point field equations for the local slope and noise fields, replacing the noisy Burgers equation, are solved yielding nonlinear localized soliton solutions and extended linear diffusive mode solutions, describing the morphology of a growing interface. The canonical formalism and the principle of least action also associate momentum, energy, and action with a soliton-diffusive mode configuration and thus provides a selection criterion for the noise-induced fluctuations. In a ``quantum mechanical'' representation of the path integral the noise fluctuations, corresponding to different paths in the path integral, are interpreted as ``quantum fluctuations'' and the growth morphology represented by a Landau-type quasi-particle gas of ``quantum solitons'' with gapless dispersion and ``quantum diffusive modes'' with a gap in the spectrum. Finally, the scaling properties are dicussed from a heuristic point of view in terms of a``quantum spectral representation'' for the slope correlations. The dynamic eponent z=3/2 is given by the gapless soliton dispersion law, whereas the roughness exponent zeta =1/2 follows from a regularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation. A heuristic expression for the scaling function is given by spectral representation and has a form similar to the probability distribution for Levy flights with index $z$."

We show that this condition on $A$ implies something much stronger: that an unknown vector $x$ can be recovered from measurements $y = T A x$, when the unknown $T$ belongs to an arbitrary set of invertible, diagonalizable linear transformations $\\mathcal{T}$. The set $\\mathcal{T}$ can be finite or countably infinite. When it is the set of $m \\times m$ permutation matrices, we have the classical unlabeled sampling problem.

Afterwards, a general connection which includes a two-form field is settled-down, solving the problem of setting a gauge theory for the Kalb-Ramond field for generical groups.   Topological Chern-Simons theories can also be defined in four dimensions, and this approach clarifies their relation to the so-called $B \\wedge F$-theories. We also revise some standard aspects of Kalb-Ramond theories in view of these new perspectives.   Since this gauge connection is built upon a pair of fields consisting of a one-form and a two-form, one may define Yang-Mills theories as usually and, remarkably, also {\\it minimal coupling} with bosonic matter, where the Kalb-Ramond field appears naturally as mediator; so, a new associated conserved charge can be defined. For the Abelian case, we explicitly construct the minimal interaction between $B$-field and matter following a \"gauge principle\" and find a novel conserved tensor current. This is our most significative result from the physical viewpoint.   This framework is also generalized in such a way that any $p$-rank tensor may be formulated as a gauge field."

The latter of these two concepts is studied in particular form with a general optical multiport device, consisting of an arbitrary array of beam-splitters and phase-shifters. I show how such an apparatus generalizes the original projection synthesis technique, introduced as an in principle technique to measure the canonical phase distribution. Just as for the original projection synthesis, it is found that such a generalised device can synthesize any general projection onto a state in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. One of the important findings of this thesis is that, unlike the original projection synthesis technique, the general apparatus described here only requires a classical, that is a coherent, reference field at the input of the device. Such an apparatus lends itself much more readily to practical implementation and would find applications in measurement and predictive state engineering.   If we relax the above condition to allow for just a single non-classical reference field, we show that the apparatus is capable of producing a single-shot measure of canonical phase. That is, the apparatus can project onto any one of an arbitrarily large subset of phase eigenstates, with a probability proportional to the overlap of the phase state and the input field. Unlike the original projection synthesis proposal, this proposal requires a binomial reference state as opposed to a reciprocal binomial state. We find that such a reference state can be obtained, to an excellent approximation, from a suitably squeezed state.   The analysis of these measurement apparatuses is performed in the less usual, but completely rigorous, retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics."

We use a Newtonian 3D SPH code, and model the NS with a stiff (index G=3 and G=2.5) polytropic equation of state and the black hole as a Newtonian point mass. Our initial conditions correspond to irrotational binaries in equilibrium (approximating the NS as a compressible ellipsoid), and we have explored configurations with different initial mass ratios, 0.2< q=M_ns/M_bh<0.5. The dynamical evolution is followed for ~23ms. We include gravitational radiation losses in the quadrupole approximation for a point-mass binary. For G=3, after an initial episode of mass transfer, the NS is not completely disrupted and a remnant core remains in orbit about the black hole. For G=2.5 the disruption is more complex, with the NS being totally disrupted during a second periastron passage. The accretion disc formed around the black hole contains ~0.2 solar masses. A nearly baryon-free axis is always present in the system, and only modest beaming of a relativistic fireball that could give rise to a GRB would be sufficient to avoid baryon contamination. Around 0.01 solar masses may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could contribute substantially to the amount of observed galactic r-process material. We calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms in the quadrupole approximation. We also present the results of simulations that have used spherical NSs relaxed in isolation as initial conditions, in order to gauge the effect of using non-equilibrium initial conditions on the coalescence."

        "Title": "Doping a Mott Insulator: Physics of High Temperature Superconductivity",
        "Abstract": "This article reviews the effort to understand the physics of high temperature superconductors from the point of view of doping a Mott insulator. The basic electronic structure of the cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. We introduce Anderson's idea of the resonating valence bond (RVB) and argue that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuation is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature which is driven by phase fluctuation and thermal excitation of quasiparticles. We then describe the numerical method of projected wavefunction which turns out to be a very useful technique to implement the strong correlation constraint, and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the RVB idea on a more formal footing. The slave-boson is introduced to enforce the constraint of no double occupation. The implementation of the local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. We give a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. We next describe the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping. We show that inclusion of gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase."

        "Title": "Testing a new analytic model for gravitational lensing probabilities",
        "Abstract": "We study gravitational lensing with a multiple lens plane approach, proposing a simple analytical model for the probability distribution function (PDF) of the dark matter convergence, kappa, for the different lens planes in a given cosmology as a function of redshift and smoothing angle, theta. The model is fixed solely by the variance of kappa, which in turn is fixed by the amplitude of the power spectrum, sigma_8. We test the PDF against a high resolution Tree-Particle-Mesh simulation and find that it is far superior to the Gaussian or the lognormal, especially for small values of theta << 1 arcmin and at large values of kappa relevant to strong lensing. With this model, we predict the probabilities of strong lensing by a single plane or by multiple planes. We find that for theta ~ 10 arcsec, a single plane accounts for almost all (~ 98%) of the strong lensing cases for source redshift unity. However, for a more typical source redshift of 4, about 12% of the strong lensing cases will result from the contribution of a secondary clump of matter along the line of sight, introducing a systematic error in the determination of the surface density of clusters, typically overestimating it by about 2-5%. We also find that matter inhomogenieties introduce a dispersion in the value of the angular diameter distance about its cosmological mean. The probable error relative to the mean increases with redshift to a value of about 8% for z ~ 6 and theta ~ 10 arcsec."

We demonstrate that the dynamics of the FRW model with dark energy in the form of phantom field can be regarded as a scattering process of two types: multiple chaotic and classical non-chaotic. It depends whether the spontaneously symmetry breaking takes place. In the first class of models with the spontaneously symmetry breaking the dynamics is similar to the Yang-Mills theory. We find the evidence of a fractal structure in the phase space of initial conditions. We observe similarities to the phenomenon of a multiple scattering process around the origin. In turn the class of models without the spontaneously symmetry breaking can be described as the classical non-chaotic scattering process and the methods of symbolic dynamic are also used in this case. We show that the phantom cosmology can be treated as a simple model with scattering of trajectories which character depends crucially on a sign of a square of mass. We demonstrate that there is a possibility of chaotic behavior in the flat Universe with a conformally coupled phantom field in the system considered on non-zero energy level. We obtain that the acceleration is a generic feature in the considered model without the spontaneously symmetry breaking. We observe that the effective EOS coefficient oscillates and then approach to $w=-1$."

Ground manifold of the polar centers includes three terms $^{1}A_{1g}$ (Zhang-Rice singlet), $^{1}E_{u}$, $^{3}E_{u}$ with different spin multiplicity, orbital degeneracy and parity that provides an unconventional multi-mode behaviour of the cuprates. The spin subsystem of the copper oxides within the polar Jahn-Teller $CuO_{4}$ centers model is a two-component spin liquid and corresponds to a singlet-triplet magnet with possible noncollinear spin configurations. In the framework of a modified mean field approximation some kinds of spin ordering are discussed including as a trivial singlet or triplet states as a pure quantum singlet-triplet mixed state. A local boson movement is accompanied by a modulation of the spin density on the site resulting in the so called induced spin fluctuations. Some unconventional features of the induced spin fluctuations are considered including an appearance of the induced longitudinal ferrimagnetism with an appropriate contribution to the spin susceptibility, a possibility to observe and examine the charge fluctuations with the help of the traditional magnetic methods such as the magnetic inelastic neutron scattering and the spin lattice relaxation experiments. The suggested model, in comparison with the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi-liquid model, represents new approach to the description of the spin system of the high-$T_c$ cuprates."

        "Abstract": "We consider the discrete Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis process (HAD) and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in Z. The basic coupling induces a multiclass process which is useful in discussing shock measures and other important properties of the processes. The invariant measures of the multiclass systems are the same for both processes, and can be constructed as the law of the output process of a system of multiclass queues in tandem; the arrival and service processes of the queueing system are a collection of independent Bernoulli product measures. The proof of invariance involves a new coupling between stationary versions of the processes called a multi-line process; this process has a collection of independent Bernoulli product measures as an invariant measure. Some of these results have appeared elsewhere and this paper is partly a review, with some proofs given only in outline. However we emphasize a new approach via dual points: when the graphical construction is used to construct a trajectory of the TASEP or HAD process as a function of a Poisson process in ZxR, the dual points are those which govern the time-reversal of the trajectory. Each line of the multi-line process is governed by the dual points of the line below. We also mention some other processes whose multiclass versions have the same invariant measures, and we note an extension of Burke's theorem to multiclass queues which follows from the results."

        "Abstract": "Multiple emission of intermediate-mass fragments has been studied for the collisions of p, $^4$He and $^{12}$C on Au with the $4\\pi$ setup FASA. The mean IMF multiplicities (for the events with at least one IMF) are saturating at the value of $2.2\\pm0.2$ for the incident energies above 6 GeV. The observed IMF multiplicities cannot be described in a two-stage scenario, a fast cascade followed by a statistical multifragmentation. Agreement with the measured IMF multiplicities is obtained by introducing an intermediate phase and modifying empirically the excitation energies and masses of the remnants.   The angular distributions and energy spectra from the p-induced collisions are in agreement with the scenario of ``thermal'' multifragmentation of a hot and diluted target spectator. In the case of $^{12}$C+Au(22.4 GeV) and $^4$He(14.6 GeV)+Au collisions, deviations from a pure thermal break-up are seen in the energy spectra of the emitted fragments, which are harder than those both from model calculations and from the measured ones for p-induced collisions. This difference is attributed to a collective flow."

The observations are well-described by a relativistic blast-wave model with a hard electron-energy distribution, p = 1.57, and a jet transition at t_j=0.93 days. These values are slightly larger than previously found as a result of a correction for the contribution from the host galaxy to the late-time ground-based observations and the larger temporal baseline provided by the Hubble Space Telescope observations. The host galaxy is found to contain a very compact core (size <0.25 arcsec) which coincides with the position of the optical transient. The STIS near ultraviolet MAMA observations allow for an investigation of the extinction properties along the line of sight to GRB010222. We find that the far ultraviolet curvature component (c_4) is rather large. In combination with the low optical extinction A_V =0.11 mag, when compared to the Hydrogen column inferred from X-ray observations, we suggest that this is evidence for dust destruction."

We obtain the explicit rates for the multivariate martingale CLT using a combination of Stein's method and Lindeberg's argument, which is then used in conjunction with a non-asymptotic analysis of averaged SGD proposed in [PJ92]. Our results have potentially interesting consequences for computing confidence intervals for parameter estimation with SGD and constructing hypothesis tests with SGD that are valid in a non-asymptotic sense."

        "Abstract": "In a previous paper with C. Bonatti ([5]), we have defined a general procedure to build new examples of Anosov flows in dimension 3. The procedure consists in gluing together some building blocks, called hyperbolic plugs, along their boundary in order to obtain a closed 3-manifold endowed with a complete flow. The main theorem of [5] states that (under some mild hypotheses) it is possible to choose the gluing maps so the resulting flow is Anosov. The aim of the present paper is to show a uniqueness result for Anosov flows obtained by such a procedure. Roughly speaking, we show that the orbital equivalence class of these Anosov flows is insensitive to the precise choice of the gluing maps used in the construction. The proof relies on a coding procedure which we find interesting for its own sake, and follows a strategy that was introduced by T. Barbot in a particular case."

After a review of the fundamental features characterizing the inflationary model, as referred to a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, we develop a generalization in view of including small inhomogeneous corrections in the theory. A second step in our discussion is devoted to show that the inflationary scenario provides a valuable dynamical ``bridge'' between a generic Kasner-like regime and a homogeneous and isotropic Universe in the horizon scale. This result is achieved by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a Bianchi IX model in the presence of a cosmological space-dependent term. In this respect, we construct a quasi-isotropic inflationary solution based on the expansion of the Einstein equations up to first-two orders of approximation, in which the isotropy of the Universe is due to the dominance of the scalar field kinetic term; the first order of approximation corresponds to the inhomogeneous corrections and is driven by the matter evolution. We show how such a quasi-isotropic solution contains a certain freedom in fixing the space functions involved in the problem. The main physical issue of this analysis corresponds to outline the impossibility for the classical origin of density perturbations, due to the exponential decay of the matter term during the de Sitter phase."

The corresponding CSP polynomial is given by $E_{\\lambda}(x;q;0)$. In addition, we prove a refined cyclic sieving phenomenon where the content of the fillings is fixed.

We study the motivational impacts of \"Thanks\" because maintaining editor engagement is a central problem for crowdsourced repositories of knowledge such as Wikimedia. Our main findings are that most editors have not been exposed to the Thanks feature (meaning they have never given nor received a thank), thanks are typically sent upwards (from less experienced to more experienced editors), and receiving a thank is correlated with having high levels of editor engagement. Though the prevalence of \"Thanks\" usage varies by editor experience, the impact of receiving a thank seems mostly consistent for all users.

        "Title": "Fully Radiative Electroweak Symmetry Breaking",
        "Abstract": "Models of Gauge-Higgs unification in extra dimensions offer a very elegant playground where one can study electroweak symmetry breaking. The nicest feature is that gauge symmetry itself protects the Higgs potential from divergences, thus potentially curing the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model. In a flat space model tree-level contributions to electroweak precision observables will be absent due to the flatness of the gauge and Higgs wave functions. The Higgs potential is fully radiatively generated and the contribution of bulk fermions will induce a vacuum expectation value. A generic problem is that the quartic scalar coupling is too low, resulting in a Higgs VEV that is too close to the compactification scale, and a Higgs mass that is too light. In this paper we show that it is possible to solve these problems in a minimal scenario by cancellations in the Higgs potential between the contribution of different bulk fermions. A crucial role is played by antiperiodic fermions: the cancellation is not the result of a fine tuning, but rather dictated by the choice of representations and parities of the fermions. We also show that introducing a relatively large representation can help in achieving a sufficiently heavy top. In this case, the strong coupling scale is lowered to a marginally acceptable value, and a more careful analysis of two loop effects should decide if the theory remains under perturbative control."

        "Abstract": "This paper is concerned with the weak-moment magnetism in heavy-fermion materials and its relation to the non-Fermi liquid physics observed near the transition to the Fermi liquid. We explore the hypothesis that the primary fluctuations responsible for the non-Fermi liquid physics are those associated with the destruction of the large Fermi surface of the Fermi liquid. Magnetism is suggested to be a low-energy instability of the resulting small Fermi surface state. A concrete realization of this picture is provided by a fractionalized Fermi liquid state which has a small Fermi surface of conduction electrons, but also has other exotic excitations with interactions described by a gauge theory in its deconfined phase. Of particular interest is a three-dimensional fractionalized Fermi liquid with a spinon Fermi surface and a U(1) gauge structure. A direct second-order transition from this state to the conventional Fermi liquid is possible and involves a jump in the electron Fermi surface volume. The critical point displays non-Fermi liquid behavior. A magnetic phase may develop from a spin density wave instability of the spinon Fermi surface. This exotic magnetic metal may have a weak ordered moment although the local moments do not participate in the Fermi surface. Experimental signatures of this phase and implications for heavy-fermion systems are discussed."

Such a Hamiltonian generates at the very point of the resonance a local gauge transformation described the unitary unimodular group SU(q). The resonant energy growth of is attributed to the zero Liouville eigenmodes of the generator in the adjoint representation of the group while the non-zero modes yield saturating with time contribution. In a vicinity of a given resonance, the quasi-Hamiltonian is then found in the form of power expansion with respect to the detuning from the resonance. The problem is related in this way to the motion along a circle in a (q^2-1)-component inhomogeneous \"magnetic\" field of a quantum particle with $q$ intrinsic degrees of freedom described by the SU(q) group. This motion is in parallel with the classical phase oscillations near a non-linear resonance.

When the replaced material is a viscous fluid, it forms a finger-like pattern, known as viscous fingering. Interestingly, most replaced materials are, in reality, viscoelastic, i.e., they behave as an elastic solid over short timescales but flow as a viscous liquid over longer timescales. Therefore, it is important to study the scenario in which the replaced material is a viscoelastic fluid. In this study, we observe the appearance of delamination-induced fingering when an incompressible organic fluid is injected into an oleophilic Hele--Shaw cell filled with an aqueous viscoelastic fluid composed of a wormlike micellar solution. We find a transition in the injection pattern: during the injection, the thick fingering pattern of the interface near the inlet changes to thin fingers with a characteristic size of four times the cell thickness. We examine the material properties, and conclude that the fingering pattern observed at later times is caused by the delamination of viscoelastic fluid from the substrate."

In a canonical formulation the morphology and scaling behavior are accessed by mean of a principle of least action in the asymptotic non-perturbative weak noise limit. The ensuing coupled saddle point field equations for the local slope and noise fields, replacing the noisy Burgers equation, are solved yielding nonlinear localized soliton solutions and extended linear diffusive mode solutions, describing the morphology of a growing interface. The canonical formalism and the principle of least action also associate momentum, energy, and action with a soliton-diffusive mode configuration and thus provides a selection criterion for the noise-induced fluctuations. In a ``quantum mechanical'' representation of the path integral the noise fluctuations, corresponding to different paths in the path integral, are interpreted as ``quantum fluctuations'' and the growth morphology represented by a Landau-type quasi-particle gas of ``quantum solitons'' with gapless dispersion and ``quantum diffusive modes'' with a gap in the spectrum. Finally, the scaling properties are dicussed from a heuristic point of view in terms of a``quantum spectral representation'' for the slope correlations. The dynamic eponent z=3/2 is given by the gapless soliton dispersion law, whereas the roughness exponent zeta =1/2 follows from a regularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation. A heuristic expression for the scaling function is given by spectral representation and has a form similar to the probability distribution for Levy flights with index $z$."

The absence of inversion symmetry is very uncommon in metals, particularly metallic oxides.

We show that if $\\mathcal B$ is a Borel subset of weakly compact operators between Banach spaces with separable duals, then the assignment $A\\in \\mathcal B\\to A^*$ can be realized by a Borel map $\\mathcal B\\to \\mathcal L$."

        "Abstract": "A wealth of observations recently challenged the notion of a universal stellar initial mass function (IMF) by showing evidences in favour of a variability of this statistical indicator as a function of galaxy properties. I present predictions from the semi-analytic model GAEA (GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly), which features (a) a detailed treatment of chemical enrichment, (b) an improved stellar feedback scheme, and (c) implements theoretical prescriptions for IMF variations. Our variable IMF realizations predict intrinsic stellar masses and mass-to-light ratios larger than those estimated from synthetic photometry assuming a universal IMF. This provides a self-consistent interpretation for the observed mismatch between photometrically inferred stellar masses of local early-type galaxies and those derived by dynamical and spectroscopic studies. At higher redshifts, the assumption of a variable IMF has a deep impact on our ability to reconstruct the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and the star formation history of galaxies."

        "Abstract": "We investigate the extended source size effects on gravitational lensing in which a lens consists of a smooth potential and small mass clumps (``substructure lensing''). We first consider a lens model that consists of a clump modeled as a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and a primary lens modeled as an external background shear and convergence. For this simple model, we derive analytic formulae for (de)magnification of circularly symmetric top-hat sources with three types of parity for their lensed images, namely, positive, negative, and doubly negative parities. Provided that the source size is sufficiently larger than the Einstein radius of the SIS, we find that in the positive (doubly negative) parity case, an extended source is always magnified (demagnified) in comparison with the unperturbed macrolens system, whereas in the negative parity case, the (de)magnification effect, which depends on the sign of convergence minus unity is weaker than those in other parities. It is shown that a measurement of the distortion pattern in a multiply lensed image enables us to break the degeneracy between the lensing effects of clump mass and those of clump distance if lensing parameters of the relevant macrolens model are determined from the position and flux of multiple images. We also show that an actual density profile of a clump can be directly measured by analyzing the ``fine structure'' in a multiply lensed image within the Einstein radius of the clump."

The ability to measure phase with this mixer allows for an atom-based receiver to detect digital modulated communication signals. In this paper, we demonstrate detection and reception of digital modulated signals based on various phase-shift keying approaches. We demonstrate Rydberg atom-based digital reception of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), and quadrature amplitude (QAM) modulated signals over a 19.626~GHz carrier to transmit and receive a bit stream in cesium vapor. We present measured values of Error Vector Magnitude (EVM, a common communication metric used to assess how accurate a symbol or bit stream is received) as a function of symbol rate for BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM modulation schemes. These results allow us to discuss the bandwidth of a Rydberg-atom based receiver system."

        "Abstract": "Sensitive and fast force measurements are performed on sheared granular layers undergoing stick-slip motion, along with simultaneous imaging. A full study has been done for spherical particles with a +-20% size distribution. Stick-slip motion due to repetitive fluidization of the layer occurs for low driving velocities. Between major slip events, slight creep occurs that is variable from one event to the next. The effects of changing the stiffness k and velocity V of the driving system are studied in detail. The stick-slip motion is almost periodic for spherical particles over a wide range of parameters, but becomes irregular when k is large and V is relatively small. At larger V, the motion becomes smoother and is affected by the inertia of the upper plate bounding the layer. Measurements of the period T and amplitude A of the relative motion are presented as a function of V. At a critical value Vc, a transition to continuous sliding motion occurs that is discontinuous for k not too large. The time dependence of the instantaneous velocity of the upper plate and the frictional force produced by the granular layer are determined within individual slipping events. The force is a multi-valued function of the instantaneous velocity, with pronounced hysteresis and a sudden drop prior to resticking. Measurements of vertical displacement reveal a small dilation of the material (about one tenth of the mean particle size in a layer 20 particles deep) associated with each slip event. Finally, optical imaging reveals that localized microscopic rearrangements precede (and follow) each slip event. The behavior of smooth particles is contrasted with that of rough particles."

        "Abstract": "In a first part the scope of classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics is discussed in the broader context of formal dynamical systems, including computer programmes. In this context classical thermodynamics appears as a particular theory suited to a subset of all dynamical systems. A statistical mechanics similar to the one derived with the microcanonical ensemble emerges from dynamical systems provided it contains, 1) a finite non-integrable part of its phase space which is, 2) ergodic at a satisfactory degree after a finite time. The integrable part of phase space provides the constraints that shape the particular system macroscopical properties, and the chaotic part provides well behaved statistical properties over a relevant finite time. More generic semi-ergodic systems lead to intermittent behaviour, thus may be unsuited for a statistical description of steady states. Following these lines of thought, in a second part non-extensive hierarchical systems with statistical scale-invariance and power law interactions are explored. Only the virial constraint, consistent with their microdynamics, is included. No assumptions of classical thermodynamics are used, in particular extensivity and local homogeneity. In the limit of a large hierarchical range new constraints emerge in some conditions that depend on the interaction law range. In particular for the gravitational case, a velocity-site scaling relation is derived which is consistant with the ones empirically observed in the fractal interstellar medium."

It is motivated by machine learning applications for high-consequence engineering systems, where this kind of information is often made available from phenomenological knowledge. We consider a GP $f$ over functions on $\\mathcal{X} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ taking values in $\\mathbb{R}$, where the process $\\mathcal{L}f$ is still Gaussian when $\\mathcal{L}$ is a linear operator. Our goal is to model $f$ under the constraint that realizations of $\\mathcal{L}f$ are confined to a convex set of functions. In particular, we require that $a \\leq \\mathcal{L}f \\leq b$, given two functions $a$ and $b$ where $a < b$ pointwise. This formulation provides a consistent way of encoding multiple linear constraints, such as shape-constraints based on e.g. boundedness, monotonicity or convexity. We adopt the approach of using a sufficiently dense set of virtual observation locations where the constraint is required to hold, and derive the exact posterior for a conjugate likelihood. The results needed for stable numerical implementation are derived, together with an efficient sampling scheme for estimating the posterior process."

The broad-band continuum, obtained by combining XRT and IBIS data, is flat (Gamma ~ 1.3) with evidence for a spectral break around 25 keV (100 keV in the source rest frame). X-ray observations indicate flux variability which is further supported by a comparison with a previous ROSAT measurement. IGR J12319-0749 is also a radio emitting object likely characterized by a flat spectrum and high radio loudness; optically it is a broad-line emitting object with a massive black hole (2.8 x 10^{9}$ solar masses) at its center. The source Spectral Energy Distribution is similar to another high redshift blazar, 225155+2217 at z=3.668: both objects are bright, with a large accretion disk luminosity and a Compton peak located in the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray band.

Efficient and accurate identification of these subparts promises to significantly improve algorithms for stylization, deformation, morphing and animation of 2D drawings. In this paper, we propose a neural network model that segments symbols into stroke-level components. Our segmentation framework has two main elements: a fixed feature extractor and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network that identifies a component based on the feature. As the feature extractor we utilize an encoder of a stroke-rnn, which is our newly proposed generative Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) model that reconstructs symbols on a stroke by stroke basis. Experiments show that a single encoder could be reused for segmenting multiple categories of sketched symbols with negligible effects on segmentation accuracies. Our segmentation scores surpass existing methodologies on an available small state of the art dataset. Moreover, extensive evaluations on our newly annotated big dataset demonstrate that our framework obtains significantly better accuracies as compared to baseline models. We release the dataset to the community."

Our analysis uses semidefinite programming in the coherent state framework and aims at simultaneously optimizing over the noise and losses introduced by a dishonest party.

A {\\it motion planner} is given by a splitting $X\\times X = F_1\\cup F_2\\cup ... \\cup F_k$ (where $F_1, ..., F_k$ are pairwise disjoint ENRs, see below) and by continuous maps $s_j: F_j \\to PX,$ such that $E\\circ s_j =1_{F_j}$.

Adding a copy of our monotile to a patch of tiles must satisfy two rules that apply only to adjacent tiles. The first is inspired by the Socolar--Taylor monotile, but can be realised by shape alone. The second is a local growth rule; a direct isometry of our monotile can be added to any patch of tiles provided that a tree on the monotile connects continuously with a tree on one of its neighbouring tiles. This condition forces tilings to grow along dendrites, which ultimately results in nonperiodic tilings. Our local growth rule initiates a new method to produce tilings of the plane."

        "Title": "Field Stars, Open Clusters, and the Galactic Abundance Gradient",
        "Abstract": "The effects of the orbital diffusion of stars and clusters on the galactic abundance gradient have been modelled. For a single generation of field stars, the results confirm previous analyses based upon the assumption of a linear gradient with galactocentric distance. Though the dispersion in metallicity at a given radius grows with time, the underlying slope across the disk remains unchanged. For a disk dominated by a discontinuity in [Fe/H] beyond the solar circle, but no gradient within the inner or outer disk, a gradient is derived for any sample whose galactocentric baseline overlaps the discontinuity. The consequence of orbital diffusion is to shift the observable edge of the transition in [Fe/H] to smaller galactocentric distance. In contrast, star clusters of a single generation evaporate so quickly that the small surviving sample of the oldest clusters is statistically insufficient to define any but a linear gradient. Inclusion of multiple generations of stars and clusters with a plausible age-metallicity relation enhances these patterns by expanding the metallicity range at a given galactocentric distance through the inclusion of stars with a wide range in both age and galactocentric origin. For field stars, the metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood is virtually indistinguishable for the two cases modelled. Because ages, abundances, and distances can be reliably determined for clusters and any sample of clusters is invariably dominated by clusters formed over the last 2 Gyrs, the cluster population offers a means for finding detailed structure within the recent galactic abundance gradient. Using clusters to extend the galactocentric baseline would supply an additional critical test of the discontinuity."

We outline the derivation of this equation within the Nakajima-Zwanzig formalism and point out technical problems related to its numerical implementation for more realistic systems which can neither be described by non-interacting two-level models nor by a steady-state Markov-Lindblad equation. We first solve the GME for a lattice model and discuss the dynamics of many-body states in a two-dimensional nanowire, the dynamical onset of the current-current correlations in electrostatically coupled parallel quantum dots and transient thermoelectric properties. Secondly, we rely on a continuous model to get the Rabi oscillations of the photocurrent through a double-dot etched in a nanowire and embedded in a quantum cavity.

This paper focuses on accessing data stored in disparate relational databases through a web service interface, and exploits the features of a Data Warehouse and Data Marts. We present a middleware that enables applications to access data stored in geographically distributed relational databases without being aware of their physical locations and underlying schema. A web service interface is provided to enable applications to access this middleware in a language and platform independent way. A prototype implementation was created based on Clarens [4], Unity [7] and POOL [8].

Indications exist that the gravitational mass of Alpha Cen B could be higher than its modeled mass, the difference being consistent with a substellar companion of a few tens of Jupiter masses. However, Alpha Centauri usually appears in star catalogues surrounded by a large void area, due to the strong diffused light. Aims: We searched for faint comoving companions to Alpha Cen located at angular distances of the order of a few tens of arcseconds, up to 2-3 arcmin. As a secondary objective, we built a catalogue of the detected background sources. Methods: In order to complement our adaptive optics search at small angular distances (Paper I), we used atmosphere limited CCD imaging from the NTT-SUSI2 instrument in the Bessel V, R, I, and Z bands. Results: We present the results of our search in the form of a catalogue of the detected objects inside a 5.5 arcmin box around this star. A total of 4313 sources down to mV~24 and mI~22 were detected from this wide-field survey. We extracted the infrared photometry of part of the detected sources from archive images of the 2MASS survey (JHK bands). We investigate briefly the nature of the detected sources, many of them presenting extremely red color indices (V-K > 14). Conclusions: We did not detect any companion to Alpha Centauri between 100 and 300 AU, down to a maximum mass of ~15 times Jupiter. We also mostly exclude the presence of a companion more massive than 30 MJup between 50 and 100 AU."

We calculate the energy spectrum and the waveform of gravitational waves for axial modes. Since metric perturbations in axial modes do not couple to the matter fluid of the star, emitted waves for a normal neutron star show only one peak in the spectrum, which corresponds to the orbital frequency at the turning point, where the gravitational field is strongest. However, for an ultracompact star (the radius $R \\lesssim 3M$), another type of resonant periodic peak appears in the spectrum. This is just because of an excitation by a scattered particle of axial quasinormal modes, which were found by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari. This excitation comes from the existence of the potential minimum inside of a star. We also find for an ultracompact star many small periodic peaks at the frequency region beyond the maximum of the potential, which would be due to a resonance of two waves reflected by two potential barriers (Regge-Wheeler type and one at the center of the star). Such resonant peaks appear neither for a normal neutron star nor for a Schwarzschild black hole. Consequently, even if we analyze the energy spectrum of gravitational waves only for axial modes, it would be possible to distinguish between an ultracompact star and a normal neutron star (or a Schwarzschild black hole)."

The basis is the theory of semigroups of linear operators mapping a Banach space $X$ into itself. The rates of approximation play a basic role.   Another tool is a Drazin-like inverse operator $B$ for the infinitesimal generator $A$ of a semigroup that arises naturally in ergodic theory. This operator $B$ is a closed, not necessarily bounded, operator. It was introduced in a paper with U. Westphal (1970/71) and extended to a generalized setting with J. J. Koliha (2009).   The novel open problem concerns the third or Robin's problem of potential theory, the solution of which is not a semigroup of operators. Hence, the semigroup methods applied to Dirichlet's or Neumann's problem cannot be applied. The authors give several hints how to overcome these difficulties."

We show that it is always possible to find a set of vector fields which will (locally) admit a Lie algebroid gauging. Furthermore, the gauging process is not unique; if the vector fields span the tangent space of the manifold, there is a free choice of a flat connection. Ensuring that the gauged action is equivalent to the ungauged action imposes the real constraint of the Lie algebroid gauging proposal. It does not appear possible (in general) to find a field strength term which can be added to the action via a Lagrange multiplier to impose the equivalence of the gauged and ungauged actions. This prevents the proposal from being used to extend T-duality. Integrability of local Lie algebroid actions to global Lie groupoid actions is discussed."

        "Abstract": "Brane gas cosmology is a scenario inspired by string theory which proposes a simple resolution to the initial singularity problem and gives a dynamical explanation for the number of spatial dimensions of our universe. In this work we have studied analytically and numerically the late-time behaviour of these type of cosmologies taking a proper care of the annihilation of winding modes. This has help us to clarify and extend several aspects of their dynamics. We have found that the decay of winding states into non-winding states behaving like a gas of ordinary non-relativistic particles precludes the existence of a late expansion phase of the universe and obstructs the growth of three large spatial dimensions as we observe today. We propose a generic solution to this problem by considering the dynamics of a gas of non-static branes. We have also obtained a simple criterion on the initial conditions to ensure the small string coupling approximation along the whole dynamical evolution, and consequently, the consistency of an effective low-energy description. Finally, we have reexamined the general conditions for a loitering period in the evolution of the universe which could serve as a mechanism to resolve the {\\sl brane problem} - a problem equivalent to the {\\sl domain wall problem} in standard cosmology - and discussed the scaling properties of a self-interacting network of winding modes taking into account the effects of the dilaton dynamics."

        "Abstract": "We study the overall spin precession frequency of a test gyroscope around a neutron star. The precession of the test gyroscope gives the signatures of the general relativistic effects that are present in the region of strong gravity of an NS. Using a numerical code, we find the precession of the test gyroscope for a rotating and a strongly magnetized neutron star. The magnetic field distribution inside the neutron star is assumed either to be poloidal or toroidal. The overall spin precession rate is obtained by setting the orbital frequency of the gyroscope to a non-zero value but restricted to a time-like observer. The gyro frequency differs depending on the central object being a black hole or a neutron star. For neutron star, the gyro precession can even be calculated inside the star. We find that the gyroscope precession frequency depends on the stars mass, rotation rate, and magnetic field configuration."

        "Title": "Local Characteristics, Entropy and Limit Theorems for Spanning Trees and  Domino Tilings via Transfer-Impedances",
        "Abstract": "Let G be a finite graph or an infinite graph on which Z^d acts with finite fundamental domain. If G is finite, let T be a random spanning tree chosen uniformly from all spanning trees of G; if G is infinite, known methods show that this still makes sense, producing a random essential spanning forest of G. A method for calculating local characteristics (i.e. finite-dimensional marginals) of T from the transfer-impedance matrix is presented. This differs from the classical matrix-tree theorem in that only small pieces of the matrix (n-dimensional minors) are needed to compute small (n-dimensional) marginals. Calculation of the matrix entries relies on the calculation of the Green's function for G, which is not a local calculation. However, it is shown how the calculation of the Green's function may be reduced to a finite computation in the case when G is an infinite graph admitting a Z^d-action with finite quotient. The same computation also gives the entropy of the law of T. These results are applied to the problem of tiling certain lattices by dominos - the so-called dimer problem. Another application of these results is to prove modified versions of conjectures of Aldous on the limiting distribution of degrees of a vertex and on the local structure near a vertex of a uniform random spanning tree in a lattice whose dimension is going to infinity. Included is a generalization of moments to tree-valued random variables and criteria for these generalized moments to determine a distribution."

        "Abstract": "The rather wide-spread belief that cosmological expansion of a flat 3D--space (with spatial curvature k=0) cannot be observationally distinguished from a kinematics of galaxies moving in a flat and non-expanding space is erroneous. We suggest that the error may have its source in a non relativistic intuition that imagines the Universe not as a spacetime but separates space from time and pictures the cosmological expansion as space evolving in time. The physical reality, however, is fundamentally different -- the expanding Universe is necessarily a curved spacetime. We show here that the fact that the spacetime is curved implies that the interpretation of the observed cosmological redshift as being due to the expansion of the cosmological 3D--space is observationally verifiable. Thus it is impossible to mimic the true cosmological redshift by a Doppler effect caused by motion of galaxies in a non-expanding 3D-space, flat or curved. We summarize our points in simple spacetime diagrams that illustrate a gedanken experiment distinguishing between expansion of space and pure kinematics. We also provide all relevant mathematics. None of the previously published discussions of the issue, including a recent popular Scientific American article, offered a similarly clear way out of the confusion."

We compute rate functions and effective dynamics conditioned on large deviations for these observables. While generally different, for a unique and non-trivial choice of rates (up to a rescaling of time) the velocity rate functions for the two models become identical, whereas the effective processes generating the fluctuations remain distinct. This equivalence coincides with a remarkable parity of the spectra of the processes' generators. For the occupation-time problem, we show that both the passive and active particles undergo a prototypical dynamical phase transition when the average velocity is non-vanishing in the long-time limit."

To meet the physics goals, the vertex and tracking detectors require not only a spatial resolution of a few micrometers and a very low material budget, but also timing capabilities with a precision of a few nanoseconds to allow suppression of beam-induced backgrounds.   Different technologies using hybrid silicon detectors are explored for the vertex detectors, such as dedicated readout ASICs, small-pitch active edge sensors as well as capacitively coupled High-Voltage CMOS sensors. Monolithic sensors are considered as an option for the tracking detector, and a prototype using a CMOS process with a high-resistivity epitaxial layer is being designed. Different designs using a silicon-on-insulator process are under investigation for both vertex and tracking detector.   All prototypes are evaluated in laboratory and beam tests, and newly developed simulation tools combining Geant4 and TCAD are used to assess and optimize their performance.

Such an advanced quantum circuit merges for the first time, both optical-optical and electro-optical non-linear functions necessary to implement the desired on-chip single qubit teleportation. On one hand, spontaneous parametric down-conversion is used to produce entangled photon-pairs. On the other hand, we take advantage of two photon routers, consisting of electro-optically controllable couplers, to separate the paired photons and to perform a Bell state measurement, respectively. After having validated all the individual functions in the classical regime, we have performed a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment to mimic a one-way quantum communication link. Such a quantum effect, seen as a prerequisite towards achieving teleportation, has been obtained, at one of the routers, when the chip was coupled to an external single photon source. The two-photon interference pattern shows a net visibility of 80%, which validates the proof of principle of a \"quantum relay circuit\" for qubits carried by telecom photons. In case of optimized losses, such a chip could increase the maximal achievable distance of one-way quantum key distribution links by a factor 1.8. Our approach and results emphasize the high potential of integrated optics on lithium niobate as a key technology for future reconfigurable quantum information manipulation."

        "Title": "Evolutionary Model of a Anonymous Consumer Durable Market",
        "Abstract": "An analytic model is presented that considers the evolution of a market of durable goods. The model suggests that after introduction goods spread always according to a Bass diffusion. However, this phase will be followed by a diffusion process for durable consumer goods governed by a variation-selection-reproduction mechanism and the growth dynamics can be described by a replicator equation. Describing the aggregate sales as the sum of first, multiple and replacement purchase the product life cycle can be derived. Replacement purchase causes periodic variations of the sales determined by the finite lifetime of the good (Juglar cycles). The model suggests that both, Bass- and Gompertz diffusion may contribute to the product life cycle of a consumer durable. The theory contains the standard equilibrium view of a market as a special case. It depends on the time scale, whether an equilibrium or evolutionary description is more appropriate. The evolutionary framework is used to derive also the size, growth rate and price distribution of manufacturing business units. It predicts that the size distribution of the business units (products) is lognormal, while the growth rates exhibit a Laplace distribution. Large price deviations from the mean price are also governed by a Laplace distribution (fat tails). These results are in agreement with empirical findings. The explicit comparison of the time evolution of consumer durables with empirical investigations confirms the close relationship between price decline and Gompertz diffusion, while the product life cycle can be described qualitatively for a long time period."

We define the concept of an $A$-scaffold on $L$, thereby extending and refining the notion of a Galois scaffold considered in several previous papers, where $L/K$ was Galois and $A=K[G]$ for $G=\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. When a suitable $A$-scaffold exists, we show how to answer questions generalizing those of classical integral Galois module theory. We give a necessary and sufficient condition, involving only numerical parameters, for a given fractional ideal to be free over its associated order in $A$. We also show how to determine the number of generators required when it is not free, along with the embedding dimension of the associated order. In the Galois case, the numerical parameters are the ramification breaks associated with $L/K$. We apply these results to biquadratic Galois extensions in characteristic 2, and to totally and weakly ramified Galois $p$-extensions in characteristic $p$. We also apply our results to the non-classical situation where $L/K$ is a finite primitive purely inseparable extension of arbitrary exponent that is acted on, via a higher derivation (but in many different ways), by the divided power $K$-Hopf algebra."

This can be thought as the extension of Giroux's Legendrian realization (which holds for contact open books) for the case of convex open books.

Its spectrum is well described by a power law (photon index Gamma=2.3+/-0.1) affected by an absorption largely exceeding (by a factor ~5) the expected Galactic one, requiring the contribution of an intrinsic, redshifted absorber. In the optical/NIR range, the afterglow emission was observed in the Ks band, as a weak source superimposed to the host galaxy, with magnitude Ks=19.44+/-0.13 (12 hours after the GRB, contribution from the host subtracted); in other bands the flux is dominated by the host galaxy. Coupling constraints derived from X-ray spectral fitting and from photometry of the host, we estimated a gas column density in the range (0.4-2.6)x10^22 cm^-2 in the GRB host galaxy, likely located at a redshift 0.5<z<1.7.

        "Title": "A Relativistic Mean Field Model for Entrainment in General Relativistic  Superfluid Neutron Stars",
        "Abstract": "General relativistic superfluid neutron stars have a significantly more intricate dynamics than their ordinary fluid counterparts. Superfluidity allows different superfluid (and superconducting) species of particles to have independent fluid flows, a consequence of which is that the fluid equations of motion contain as many fluid element velocities as superfluid species. Whenever the particles of one superfluid interact with those of another, the momentum of each superfluid will be a linear combination of both superfluid velocities. This leads to the so-called entrainment effect whereby the motion of one superfluid will induce a momentum in the other superfluid. We have constructed a fully relativistic model for entrainment between superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons using a relativistic $\\sigma - \\omega$ mean field model for the nucleons and their interactions. In this context there are two notions of ``relativistic'': relativistic motion of the individual nucleons with respect to a local region of the star (i.e. a fluid element containing, say, an Avogadro's number of particles), and the motion of fluid elements with respect to the rest of the star. While it is the case that the fluid elements will typically maintain average speeds at a fraction of that of light, the supranuclear densities in the core of a neutron star can make the nucleons themselves have quite high average speeds within each fluid element. The formalism is applied to the problem of slowly-rotating superfluid neutron star configurations, a distinguishing characteristic being that the neutrons can rotate at a rate different from that of the protons."

We adopt a simple phenomenological description of the anisotropy, in which the most energetic electrons have a small pitch angle and the least energetic electrons are isotropic, as proposed by Sobacchi \\& Lyubarsky (2019). We explore (i) a simple model that assumes a phenomenological shape for the electron energy distribution, and (ii) a self-consistent scheme in which the electrons follow a distribution which is the result of the balance between injection and radiative losses (we include the effects of the anisotropy on the synchrotron cooling rate). Considering the BL Lac object Mkn 421 as representative of the entire class, we show that in both cases the emission can be satisfactorily reproduced under equipartition between the magnetic field and the relativistic electrons. This is in better agreement with the idea that jets are launched as Poynting dominated flows with respect to the standard isotropic scenario, which requires both a low magnetization and a low radiative efficiency to reproduce the observed emission. The hard spectrum predicted for the inverse Compton continuum at TeV energies could be used as a potential test of the anisotropic model."

A promising structure for this end is a topological one-dimensional (1D) channel formed in bilayer graphene (BLG) under special electrostatic conditions or specific stacking configuration, called domain wall (DW). In these 1D channels, the valley-index defines the propagation direction of the charge carriers and the chiral edge states (kink states) are robust over many kinds of disorder. However, the fabrication of DWs is challenging, requiring the design of complex multi-gate structures or have been producing on rough substrates, showing a limited mean free path. Here, we report on a high-quality DW formed at the curved boundary of folded bilayer graphene (folded-BLG). At such 1D conducting channel we measured a two-terminal resistance close to the quantum resistance $R = e^2/4h$ at zero magnetic field, a signature of kink states. Our experiments reveal a long-range ballistic transport regime that occurs only at the DW of the folded-BLG, while the other regions behave like semiconductors with tunable band gap."

Ground manifold of the polar centers includes three terms $^{1}A_{1g}$ (Zhang-Rice singlet), $^{1}E_{u}$, $^{3}E_{u}$ with different spin multiplicity, orbital degeneracy and parity that provides an unconventional multi-mode behaviour of the cuprates. The spin subsystem of the copper oxides within the polar Jahn-Teller $CuO_{4}$ centers model is a two-component spin liquid and corresponds to a singlet-triplet magnet with possible noncollinear spin configurations. In the framework of a modified mean field approximation some kinds of spin ordering are discussed including as a trivial singlet or triplet states as a pure quantum singlet-triplet mixed state. A local boson movement is accompanied by a modulation of the spin density on the site resulting in the so called induced spin fluctuations. Some unconventional features of the induced spin fluctuations are considered including an appearance of the induced longitudinal ferrimagnetism with an appropriate contribution to the spin susceptibility, a possibility to observe and examine the charge fluctuations with the help of the traditional magnetic methods such as the magnetic inelastic neutron scattering and the spin lattice relaxation experiments. The suggested model, in comparison with the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi-liquid model, represents new approach to the description of the spin system of the high-$T_c$ cuprates."

This was demon- strated by the 33 MJ muzzle energy shot performed in 2010 in the framework of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) electromag- netic railgun program. Since then, railguns are a prime candidate for future long range artillery systems. In this scenario, a heavy projectile (several kilograms) is accelerated to approx. 2.5 km/s muzzle velocity. While the primary interest for such a hypersonic projectile is the bombardment of targets being hundreds of kilometers away, they can also be used to counter airplane attacks or in other direct fire scenarios. In these cases, the large initial velocity significantly reduces the time to impact the target. In this study we investigate a scenario, where a future shipboard railgun installation delivers the same kinetic energy to a target as the explosive round of a contemporary European ship artillery system. At the same time the railgun outperforms the current artillery systems in range. For this scenario a first draft for the parameters of a railgun system were derived. For the flight-path of the projectile, trajectories for different launch angles were simulated and the aero-thermodynamic heating was estimated using engineering-tools developed within the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This enables the assessment of the feasibility of the different strike scenarios, as well as the identification of the limits of the technology. It is envisioned that this baseline design can be used as a helpful starting point for discussions of a possible electrical weaponization of future European warships."

The LB method is used as a model for the solvent in order to take into account the hydrodynamic mass and momentum transport through the solvent. The colloidal particles are propagated via MD and they are coupled to the LB fluid by viscous forces. With respect to the LB fluid, the colloids are represented by uniformly distributed points on a sphere. Each such point (with a velocity V(r) at any off-lattice position r is interacting with the neighboring eight LB nodes by a frictional force F=\\xi_0(V(r)-u(r)) with \\xi_0 being a friction force and u(r) being the velocity of the fluid at the position r. Thermal fluctuations are introduced in the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics. This coupling scheme has been proposed recently for polymer systems by Ahlrichs and D\"unweg [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 8225 (1999)]. We investigate several properties of a single colloidal particle in a LB fluid, namely the effective Stokes friction and long time tails in the autocorrelation functions for the translational and rotational velocity. Moreover, a charged colloidal system is considered consisting of a macroion, counterions and coions that are coupled to a LB fluid. We study the behavior of the ions in a constant electric field. In particular, an estimate of the effective charge of the macroion is yielded from the number of counterions that move with the macroion in the direction of the electric field."

Many of these tasks are of a categorical prediction variety: given a conditioning context (e.g., an NLI premise), provide a label based on an associated prompt (e.g., an NLI hypothesis). The categorical nature of these tasks has led to common use of a cross entropy log-loss objective during training. We suggest this loss is intuitively wrong when applied to plausibility tasks, where the prompt by design is neither categorically entailed nor contradictory given the context. Log-loss naturally drives models to assign scores near 0.0 or 1.0, in contrast to our proposed use of a margin-based loss. Following a discussion of our intuition, we describe a confirmation study based on an extreme, synthetically curated task derived from MultiNLI. We find that a margin-based loss leads to a more plausible model of plausibility. Finally, we illustrate improvements on the Choice Of Plausible Alternative (COPA) task through this change in loss."

We explicitly prove that the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA), including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels, is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory developed by Nozi\\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\\it depend} on the strength of effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance."

        "Abstract": "The MSSM with right-handed neutrino supermultiplets, gauged B-L symmetry and a non-vanishing sneutrino expectation value is the minimal theory that spontaneously breaks R-parity and is consistent with the bounds on proton stability and lepton number violation. This minimal B-L MSSM can have a colored/charged LSP, of which a stop LSP is the most amenable to observation at the LHC. We study the R-parity violating decays of a stop LSP into a bottom quark and charged leptons--the dominant modes for a generic \"admixture\" stop. A numerical analysis of the relative branching ratios of these decay channels is given using a wide scan over the parameter space. The fact that R-parity is violated in this theory by a vacuum expectation value of a sneutrino links these branching ratios directly to the neutrino mass hierarchy. It is shown how a discovery of bottom-charged lepton events at the LHC can potentially determine whether the neutrino masses are in a normal or inverted hierarchy, as well as determining the theta_23 neutrino mixing angle. Finally, present LHC bounds on these leptoquark signatures are used to put lower bounds on the stop mass."

        "Abstract": "We investigate the impact on the properties of high-energy emitting BL Lac objects of a population of electrons with an anisotropic momentum distribution. We adopt a simple phenomenological description of the anisotropy, in which the most energetic electrons have a small pitch angle and the least energetic electrons are isotropic, as proposed by Sobacchi \\& Lyubarsky (2019). We explore (i) a simple model that assumes a phenomenological shape for the electron energy distribution, and (ii) a self-consistent scheme in which the electrons follow a distribution which is the result of the balance between injection and radiative losses (we include the effects of the anisotropy on the synchrotron cooling rate). Considering the BL Lac object Mkn 421 as representative of the entire class, we show that in both cases the emission can be satisfactorily reproduced under equipartition between the magnetic field and the relativistic electrons. This is in better agreement with the idea that jets are launched as Poynting dominated flows with respect to the standard isotropic scenario, which requires both a low magnetization and a low radiative efficiency to reproduce the observed emission. The hard spectrum predicted for the inverse Compton continuum at TeV energies could be used as a potential test of the anisotropic model."

An effective way to address this demand is to edit or deform existing 3D models based on a reference, e.g., a 2D image which is very easy to acquire. Given such a source 3D model and a target which can be a 2D image, 3D model, or a point cloud acquired as a depth scan, we introduce 3DN, an end-to-end network that deforms the source model to resemble the target. Our method infers per-vertex offset displacements while keeping the mesh connectivity of the source model fixed. We present a training strategy which uses a novel differentiable operation, mesh sampling operator, to generalize our method across source and target models with varying mesh densities. Mesh sampling operator can be seamlessly integrated into the network to handle meshes with different topologies. Qualitative and quantitative results show that our method generates higher quality results compared to the state-of-the art learning-based methods for 3D shape generation.

        "Title": "Behaving Optimally in Solar Renewable Energy Certificate Markets",
        "Abstract": "SREC markets are a relatively novel market-based system to incentivize the production of energy from solar means. A regulator imposes a floor on the amount of energy each regulated firm must generate from solar power in a given period and provides them with certificates for each generated MWh. Firms offset these certificates against the floor and pay a penalty for any lacking certificates. Certificates are tradable assets, allowing firms to purchase/sell them freely. In this work, we formulate a stochastic control problem for generating and trading in SREC markets from a regulated firm's perspective. We account for generation and trading costs, the impact both have on SREC prices, provide a characterization of the optimal strategy, and develop a numerical algorithm to solve this control problem. Through numerical experiments, we explore how a firm who acts optimally behaves under various conditions. We find that an optimal firm's generation and trading behaviour can be separated into various regimes, based on the marginal benefit of obtaining an additional SREC, and validate our theoretical characterization of the optimal strategy. We also conduct parameter sensitivity experiments and conduct comparisons of the optimal strategy to other candidate strategies."

The superlattice potential leads to essential enlargement of a number of EMPs, descend from two fundamental EMPs in the absence of superlattice. For the wave vector $k_{x}$ within the first Brillouin zone, the EMPs show as the regions of acoustical or quasi-acoustical dispersion, with a finite value of group velocity, so the regions with frequency gaps, where a group velocity is nullified at some $k_{x}$. We obtain that for $k_{x} \\to 0$ only for two EMPs the frequency tends to zero as for other EMPs it obtains finite values. Strong dependence of dispersion relations of the EMPs from the period of the superlattice $a_{0}$ and the distance $d$ from a metallic gate is shown; in particular, for typical size of a gap, for characteristic value of the frequency and $k_{x}$ at which the group velocity is reduced to zero. At the frequency that corresponds to zero group velocity of pertinent fundamental EMP branch the response of the system should present a strong resonance."

        "Abstract": "Images generated by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) can depict highly ambiguous features that are difficult to interpret correctly. One possible solution to this problem is to reconstruct the so-called exit wave, i.e. the electron wave in the microscope right before it passes the objective lens, from a series of TEM images acquired with varying focus. While the forward model of simulating a TEM image from a given exit wave is known and easy to evaluate, it is in general not possible to reconstruct the exit wave from a series of images analytically. The corresponding inverse problem can be formulated as a minimization problem, which is done in the well known MAL and MIMAP methods. We propose a generalization of the MAL algorithm by performing the exit wave reconstruction and the registration of the image series simultaneously. We show that our objective functional is not convex with respect to the exit wave, which also carries over to the MAL functional. The main result is the existence of minimizers of our objective functional. These results are based on the properties of a generalization of the cross-correlation. Finally, the applicability of our method is verified with a numerical experiment on simulated input data."

This set is defined as those theories coming from a statistical description of matter, in the sense that the three tensor fields appearing in the theory can be expressed as the three first momenta of a suitable distribution function. In this set of theories the causality condition for the resulting system of hyperbolic partial differential equations is very simple and allow to identify a subclass of manifestly causal theories, which are so for all states outside equilibrium for which the theory preserves this statistical interpretation condition. This subclass includes the usual equilibrium distributions, namely Boltzmann, Bose or Fermi distributions, according to the statistics used, suitably generalized outside equilibrium. Therefore this gives a simple proof that they are causal in a neighborhood of equilibrium. We also find a bigger set of dissipative divergence type theories which are only pseudo-statistical, in the sense that the third rank tensor of the fluid theory has the symmetry and trace properties of a third momentum of an statistical distribution, but the energy-momentum tensor, while having the form of a second momentum distribution, it is so for a different distribution function. This set also contains a subclass (including the one already mentioned) of manifestly causal theories."

        "Abstract": "A self-consistent, adiabatic model for the {\\it long-time} behaviour of tidal capture binaries is presented. It is shown that most capture orbits behave chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the values of $\\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron separation at capture.   If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly bound, highly eccentric phase.   If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.   We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \\& Paczy\\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\\odot$.

A relativistically-broadened iron line at ~6.4 keV is clearly resolved in the time-averaged spectrum, with an equivalent width of 310^{+70}_{-90} eV. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the heavily absorbed soft X-ray band confirms the existence of a variable, multi-zone warm absorber in this source, as proposed in a previous analysis of a shorter ASCA observation. The light curve of the source is wildly variable on timescales of hours or less, and a factor of nearly 10 change in count-rate was recorded in a period of less than 2000 s. The long observation and variability of the source allowed the power density spectrum (PDS) to be constructed to an unprecedented level of detail. There is evidence for a break in the PDS from a slope of \\alpha~1 to \\alpha~1.8 at a frequency of around 3 \\times 10^{-4} Hz. The central black hole mass of NGC 4395 is estimated to be approximately 10^4-10^5 solar masses using the break in the PDS, a result consistent with previous analyses using optical and kinematical techniques."

Our analysis leads to the existence of a critical mass for a given orbital distance $m_{\\rm crit}(a)$ below which the evaporation timescale becomes shorter than the thermal timescale of the planet. For planets with initial masses below $m_{\\rm crit}$, evaporation leads to a rapid expansion of the outer layers and of the total planetary radius, speeding up the evaporation process. Consequently, the planet does not survive as long as estimated by a simple application of mass loss rates without following consistently its evolution. We find out that the transit planet HD 209458b might be in such a dramatic phase, although with an extremely small probability. As a consequence, we predict that, after a certain time, only planets above a value $m_{\\rm crit}(a)$ should be present at an orbital distance $a$ of a star. For planets with initial masses above $m_{\\rm crit}$, evaporation does not affect the evolution of the radius with time."

In this work we explore the effect that a hot pion bath may have in the properties of the $X(3872)$, assuming this state to be a $D\\bar D^*+c.c.$ molecule. We derive the finite temperature effects on the $X(3872)$ from a coupled channels unitarized amplitude, obtained including the properties of the charmed mesons under such conditions. We find that the $X(3872)$ develops a subtantial width, of the order of a few tens of MeV, in hot pionic environments at temperatures $100-150$ MeV, and its nominal mass moves above the $D D^*$ threshold. The fact that the $X(3872)$ in a hot pion gas may no longer be a narrow resonance needs to be considered in the estimation of production yields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions."

Specifically, we show that there always exist two regions in the parameter space. In one region, the system possesses one single phase. However in the other region, there could coexist three phases and a van der Waals-like phase transition occurs.

Here we consider \"local\" biasing models, in which the galaxy density field $\\delta_g$ at a point is a function of the matter density field $\\delta$ at that point: $\\delta_g = f(\\delta)$. We consider both deterministic biasing, where $f$ is simply a function, and stochastic biasing, in which the galaxy density is a random variable whose distribution depends on the matter density: $\\delta_g=X(\\delta)$. We show that even when this mapping is performed on a highly nonlinear density field with a hierarchical correlation structure, the correlation function $\\xi$ is simply scaled up by a constant, as long as $\\xi << 1$. In stochastic biasing models, the galaxy autocorrelation function behaves exactly as in deterministic models, with the mean value of $X$ for a given value of $\\delta$ taking the role of the deterministic bias function. We extend our results to the power spectrum P(k), showing that for sufficiently small k, the effect of local biasing is equivalent to the multiplication of P(k) by a constant, with the addition of a constant term. If a cosmological model predicts a large-scale mass correlation function in conflict with the shape of the observed galaxy correlation function, then the model cannot be rescued by appealing to a complicated but local relation between galaxies and mass."

This is by far the smallest separation binary quasar reported to date. The two components have very different spectra, including the presence of strong broad absorption lines (BALs) in component A only. The emission-line redshifts, based on the broad high ionization C IV lines, are z_A = 0.834 and z_B = 0.858; their difference is 3900 km/s in velocity units. The broad C IV lines, however, are probably not a good indicator of systemic redshift; and LBQS 0103-2753 A and B could have a much smaller systemic redshift difference, like the other known binary quasars. If the systemic redshift difference is small, then LBQS 0103-2753 would most likely be a galaxy merger that has led to a binary supermassive black hole. There is now one known 0.3 arcsec binary among roughly 500 QSOs that have been observed in a way that would reveal such a close binary. This suggests that QSO activity is substantially more likely for black hole binaries at spacings ~2 kpc than at ~15 to 60 kpc. Between 1987 and 1998, the observed Mg II BAL disappeared."

To this end we present a new approach based on a concept of the monomer identity breaking and density functional description. We strictly derive, via a proper choice of basic structural units of the gel fraction, all statements usually supposed to be just Flory (Stockmayer) assumptions. A further analysis of the IC structure reveals some new IC structural units (those involved into mesoscopic cycles) overlooked in both Flory and Stockmayer approaches and to be described by a new order parameter characteristic only of the gel phase. As a result, the SGT is found to transform from a geometric phenomenon to a genuine 1st order phase transition always followed by a phase separation into sol and gel phases. The free energy, total conversion, volume fractions of the gel fraction and dangling monomers as well as other structural quantities are calculated as functions of a reduced monomer density and analyzed for all the existing models. The Flory approach is found to be superior to the Stockmayer-Tanaka one and satisfactorily describe some of the dense weak gel properties but fail (even qualitatively) in a quite extended vicinity of the SGT."

We associate with each vertex a random variable, representing the `state' or `fitness' of the species, with values in $[0,1]$. The dynamics proceeds as follows. Every discrete time step, we choose the vertex with minimal fitness, and assign to this vertex, and to its two neighbours, three new independent fitnesses with a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. A conjecture of physicists, based on simulations, is that in the stationary regime, the one-dimensional marginal distributions of the fitnesses converges, when $N \\to \\infty$, to a uniform distribution on $(f,1)$, for some threshold $f<1$.   In this paper we consider a discrete version of this model, proposed in \\cite{BK}. In this discrete version, the fitness of a vertex can be either 0 or 1. The system evolves according to the following rules. Each discrete time step, we choose an arbitrary vertex with fitness 0. If all the vertices have fitness 1, then we choose an arbitrary vertex with fitness 1. Then we update the fitnesses of this vertex and of its two neighbours by three new independent fitnesses, taking value 0 with probability $0<q<1$, and 1 with probability $p=1-q$. We show that if $q$ is close enough to one, then the mean average fitness in the stationary regime is bounded away from 1, uniformly in the number of vertices. This is a small step in the direction of the conjecture mentioned above, and also settles a conjecture mentioned in \\cite{BK}.   Our proof is based on a reduction to a continuous time particle system."

The bound state--problem is analogous to that of point interactions in the plane: since a two--dimensional point interaction is never repulsive, there are $ m $ discrete eigenvalues, $ 1\\le m\\le N $, the lowest of which is nondegenerate. On the other hand, due to the presence of the boundary the point interactions give rise to infinite series of resonances; if the coupling is weak they approach the thresholds of higher transverse modes. We derive also spectral and scattering properties for point perturbations in several related models: a cylindrical surface, both of a finite and infinite heigth, threaded by a magnetic flux, and a straight strip which supports a potential independent of the transverse coordinate. As for strips with an infinite number of point perturbations, we restrict ourselves to the situation when the latter are arranged periodically; we show that in distinction to the case of a point--perturbation array in the plane, the spectrum may exhibit any finite number of gaps.

In the radiation-dominated Universe, it was suggested that there are two solutions for the cosmic scale factor a(t) : the standard solution $a\\sim t^{1/2}$, and a solution $a\\sim t^{1/4}$, which is incompatible with standard big bang nucleosynthesis. In this note, we reconsider expansion of the Universe in this scenario. We derive and solve a first order, linear differential equation for H^2, the square of the expansion rate of the Universe, as a function of a. The differences between our equation for H^2 and the relationship found in standard cosmology are (i) there is a term proportional to density squared (a fact already known), which is small when the density is small compared to the brane tension, and (ii) there is a contribution which acts like a relativistic fluid. We show that this second contribution is due to gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk. Thus, we find that there need not be any conflict between cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario and the standard model of cosmology. We discuss how reheating at the end of inflation leads to the correct relationship between matter density and expansion rate, $H^2\\to 8\\pi G\\rho_m/3$, and the conditions that must be met for the expansion rate of the Universe to be close to its standard model value around the epoch of cosmological nucleosynthesis."

We study the motivational impacts of \"Thanks\" because maintaining editor engagement is a central problem for crowdsourced repositories of knowledge such as Wikimedia. Our main findings are that most editors have not been exposed to the Thanks feature (meaning they have never given nor received a thank), thanks are typically sent upwards (from less experienced to more experienced editors), and receiving a thank is correlated with having high levels of editor engagement. Though the prevalence of \"Thanks\" usage varies by editor experience, the impact of receiving a thank seems mostly consistent for all users. We empirically demonstrate that receiving a thank has a strong positive effect on short-term editor activity across the board and provide preliminary evidence that thanks could compound to have long-term effects as well."

        "Title": "Distributed Selfish Load Balancing",
        "Abstract": "Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible amongst a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a ``selfish agent'', and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents to select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced.   Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m\\gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\\log\\log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\\log\\log m+n^4)$. We also give a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\max\\{\\log\\log m,n\\})$ for the convergence time."

        "Abstract": "We perform a linear dynamical stability analysis of a general hydrodynamic model of chemotactic aggregation [Chavanis & Sire, Physica A, in press (2007)]. Specifically, we study the stability of an infinite and homogeneous distribution of cells against \"chemotactic collapse\". We discuss the analogy between the chemotactic collapse of biological populations and the gravitational collapse (Jeans instability) of self-gravitating systems. Our hydrodynamic model involves a pressure force which can take into account several effects like anomalous diffusion or the fact that the organisms cannot interpenetrate. We also take into account the degradation of the chemical which leads to a shielding of the interaction like for a Yukawa potential. Finally, our hydrodynamic model involves a friction force which quantifies the importance of inertial effects. In the strong friction limit, we obtain a generalized Keller-Segel model similar to the generalized Smoluchowski-Poisson system describing self-gravitating Langevin particles. For small frictions, we obtain a hydrodynamic model of chemotaxis similar to the Euler-Poisson system describing a self-gravitating barotropic gas. We show that an infinite and homogeneous distribution of cells is unstable against chemotactic collapse when the \"velocity of sound\" in the medium is smaller than a critical value. We study in detail the linear development of the instability and determine the range of unstable wavelengths, the growth rate of the unstable modes and the damping rate, or the pulsation frequency, of the stable modes as a function of the friction parameter and shielding length. For specific equations of state, we express the stability criterion in terms of the density of cells."

        "Abstract": "Risk control and optimal diversification constitute a major focus in the finance and insurance industries as well as, more or less consciously, in our everyday life. We present a discussion of the characterization of risks and of the optimization of portfolios that starts from a simple illustrative model and ends by a general functional integral formulation. A major theme is that risk, usually thought one-dimensional in the conventional mean-variance approach, has to be addressed by the full distribution of losses. Furthermore, the time-horizon of the investment is shown to play a major role. We show the importance of accounting for large fluctuations and use the theory of Cram\\'er for large deviations in this context. We first treat a simple model with a single risky asset that examplifies the distinction between the average return and the typical return, the role of large deviations in multiplicative processes, and the different optimal strategies for the investors depending on their size. We then analyze the case of assets whose price variations are distributed according to exponential laws, a situation that is found to describe reasonably well daily price variations. Several portfolio optimization strategies are presented that aim at controlling large risks. We end by extending the standard mean-variance portfolio optimization theory, first within the quasi-Gaussian approximation and then using a general formulation for non-Gaussian correlated assets in terms of the formalism of functional integrals developed in the field theory of critical phenomena."

Despite its significance in a lot of interdisciplinary applications, its computation is very expensive. The fastest known algorithm presently is by Brandes which takes O(|V || E|) time for computation. In real life scenarios, it happens very frequently that a single vertex or a set of vertices is sequentially removed from a network. The recomputation of Betweenness Centrality on removing a single vertex becomes expensive when the Brandes algorithm is repeated. It is to be understood that as the size of the network increases, Betweenness Centrality calculation becomes more and more expensive and even a decrease in running time by a small fraction results in a phenomenal decrease in the actual running time. The algorithm introduced in this paper achieves the same in a significantly lesser time than repetition of the Brandes algorithm. The algorithm can also be extended to a general case."

Given such a source 3D model and a target which can be a 2D image, 3D model, or a point cloud acquired as a depth scan, we introduce 3DN, an end-to-end network that deforms the source model to resemble the target. Our method infers per-vertex offset displacements while keeping the mesh connectivity of the source model fixed. We present a training strategy which uses a novel differentiable operation, mesh sampling operator, to generalize our method across source and target models with varying mesh densities. Mesh sampling operator can be seamlessly integrated into the network to handle meshes with different topologies. Qualitative and quantitative results show that our method generates higher quality results compared to the state-of-the art learning-based methods for 3D shape generation.

The proposed FDL representation samples the Light Field in the depth (or equivalently the disparity) dimension by decomposing the scene as a discrete sum of layers. The layers can be constructed from various types of Light Field inputs including a set of sub-aperture images, a focal stack, or even a combination of both. From our derivations in the Fourier domain, the layers are simply obtained by a regularized least square regression performed independently at each spatial frequency, which is efficiently parallelized in a GPU implementation. Our model is also used to derive a gradient descent based calibration step that estimates the input view positions and an optimal set of disparity values required for the layer construction. Once the layers are known, they can be simply shifted and filtered to produce different viewpoints of the scene while controlling the focus and simulating a camera aperture of arbitrary shape and size. Our implementation in the Fourier domain allows real time Light Field rendering. Finally, direct applications such as view interpolation or extrapolation and denoising are presented and evaluated."

        "Abstract": "We develop appropriately generalized notions of indexability for problems of dynamic resource allocation where the resource concerned may be assigned more flexibility than is allowed, for example, in classical multi-armed bandits. Most especially we have in mind the allocation of a divisible resource (manpower, money, equipment) to a collection of objects (projects) requiring it in cases where its over-concentration would usually be far from optimal. The resulting project indices are functions of both a resource level and a state. They have a simple interpretation as a fair charge for increasing the resource available to the project from the specified resource level when in the specified state. We illustrate ideas by reference to two model classes which are of independent interest. In the first, a pool of servers is assigned dynamically to a collection of service teams, each of which mans a service station. We demonstrate indexability under a natural assumption that the service rate delivered is increasing and concave in the team size. The second model class is a generalization of the spinning plates model for the optimal deployment of a divisible investment resource to a collection of reward generating assets. Asset indexability is established under appropriately drawn laws of diminishing returns for resource deployment. For both model classes numerical studies provide evidence that the proposed greedy index heuristic performs strongly."

There are two ways in which this can be achieved: one can consider a trace basis formed from products of traces of fermionic matrices or one can consider a Schur function basis, labeled by Young diagrams. The Schur polynomials for the fermions involve a twisted character, as a consequence of Fermi statistics. The main result of this paper is a proof that the trace and Schur bases coincide up to a simple normalization coefficient that we have computed."

According to Kohn's theorem, the frequency of this collective mode is not affected by an interaction between the atoms and is always equal to the trap frequency. This remarkable property, however, does not necessarily hold in an approximate theory. We explicitly prove that the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA), including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels, is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory developed by Nozi\\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\\it depend} on the strength of effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance."

        "Abstract": "A computational theory for classification of natural biosonar targets is developed based on the properties of an example stimulus ensemble. An extensive set of echoes (84 800) from four different foliages was transcribed into a spike code using a parsimonious model (linear filtering, half-wave rectification, thresholding). The spike code is assumed to consist of time differences (interspike intervals) between threshold crossings. Among the elementary interspike intervals flanked by exceedances of adjacent thresholds, a few intervals triggered by disjoint half-cycles of the carrier oscillation stand out in terms of resolvability, visibility across resolution scales and a simple stochastic structure (uncorrelatedness). They are therefore argued to be a stochastic analogue to edges in vision. A three-dimensional feature vector representing these interspike intervals sustained a reliable target classification performance (0.06% classification error) in a sequential probability ratio test, which models sequential processing of echo trains by biological sonar systems. The dimensions of the representation are the first moments of duration and amplitude location of these interspike intervals as well as their number. All three quantities are readily reconciled with known principles of neural signal representation, since they correspond to the center of gravity of excitation on a neural map and the total amount of excitation."

We base our studies on the UV-to-optical spectra (observed and synthetic) of early-type galaxies. A probabilistic latent variable architecture is formulated, and a rigorous Bayesian methodology is employed for solving the inverse modelling problem from the available data. A powerful aspect of our formalism is that it allows us to recover a limited fraction of missing data due to incomplete spectral coverage, as well as to handle observational errors in a principled way. We apply this method to a sample of 21 well-studied early-type spectra, with known star-formation histories. We find that our data-driven Bayesian modelling allows us to identify those early-types which contain a significant stellar population <~ 1 Gyr old. This method would therefore be a very useful tool for automatically discovering various interesting sub-classes of galaxies. (abridged)"

Experimentally, we study an 8CB Langmuir film via digitally-imaged Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM) in a four-roll mill setup which applies a transient strain and images the response. When a compact domain is stretched by the imposed strain, it first assumes a bola shape with two tear-drop shaped reservoirs connected by a thin tether which then slowly relaxes to a circular domain which minimizes the interfacial energy of the system. We process the digital images of the experiment to extract the domain shapes. We then use one of these shapes as an initial condition for the numerical solution of a boundary-integral model of the underlying hydrodynamics and compare the subsequent images of the experiment to the numerical simulation. The numerical evolutions first verify that our hydrodynamical model can reproduce the observed dynamics. They also allow us to deduce the magnitude of the line tension in the system, often to within 1%. We find line tensions in the range of 200-600 pN; we hypothesize that this variation is due to differences in the layer depths of the 8CB fluid phases."

We first study a component of this obstruction, which gives the condition that the leafwise cohomology class of the symplectic form must be transversely pluriharmonic. As a consequence, under certain topological hypotheses, we infer that we actually have a symplectic fibre bundle over a complex base. We then show how to compute the full obstruction via a spectral sequence. We give various concrete necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the obstruction. Throughout, we give examples to test the sharpness of these conditions, including a symplectic fibre bundle over a complex base which does not come from a generalized complex structure, and a regular generalized complex structure which is very unlike a symplectic fibre bundle, i.e., for which nearby leaves are not symplectomorphic."

The transition is characterized by the disappearance of the vortices from the annulus where the bulk of the superfluid is concentrated due to centrifugal forces while a macroscopic phase circulation remains. The analysis is carried out within two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii theory at large coupling constant and reveals significant differences between 'soft' anharmonic traps (like a quartic plus quadratic trapping potential) and traps with a fixed boundary: In the latter case the transition takes place in a parameter regime where the size of vortices is very small relative to the width of the annulus whereas in 'soft' traps the vortex lattice persists until the width of the annulus becomes comparable to the vortex cores. Moreover, the density profile in the annulus where the bulk is concentrated is, in the 'soft' case, approximately gaussian with long tails and not of the Thomas-Fermi type like in a trap with a fixed boundary."

We study in detail the associated spacetime distortion in the neighbourhood of the defect, which has the form of a finite-radius curved `bubble', matched with a Minkowskian space-time in the exterior. As a consequence of the non-criticality of the underlying sigma-model, the space time is unstable, and has non-trivial stochastic properties: thermal properties due to its ``Rindler accelerating nature'', and entropy growth for an asymptotic observer, associated with information being carried away by the `recoil' degrees of freedom.

It is shown that the total force on this body can be separated into two independent parts, one of which is the slowly varying influence of the aggregate stellar system, and the other being the rapidly fluctuating stochastic force due to discrete encounters with individual stars. For the particular example of a stellar system distributed according to a Plummer model, it is shown that the motion of the black hole is then similar to that of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential, and we analyze its dynamics using an approach akin to Langevin's solution of the Brownian motion problem. The equations are solved to obtain the average values, time-autocorrelation functions, and probability distributions of the black hole's position and velocity. By comparing these results to N-body simulations, we demonstrate that this model provides a very good statistical description of the actual black hole dynamics. As an application of our model, we use our results to derive a lower limit on the mass of the black hole Sgr A* in the Galactic center."

The first action is parametrization invariant, the second a generalization of the affinely parametrized quadratic action for a relativistic particle. Expressions for a conserved 4-momentum and angular momentum tensor are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in this post-Minkowski approximation. A formal solution to the equations of motion is found for a binary system with circular orbits. For a bound system of this kind, the post-Minkowski solution is a toy model that omits nonlinear terms of relevant post-Newtonian order; and we also obtain a Fokker action that is accurate to first post-Newtonian order, by adding to the post-Minkowski action a term cubic in the particle masses. Curiously, the conserved energy and angular momentum associated with the Fokker action are each finite and well-defined for this bound 2-particle system despite the fact that the total energy and angular momentum of the radiation field diverge. Corresponding solutions and conserved quantities are found for two scalar charges (for electromagnetic charges we exhibit the solution found by Schild). For a broad class of parametrization-invariant Fokker actions and for the affinely parametrized action, binary systems with circular orbits satisfy the relation $dE = \\Omega dL$ (a form of the first law of thermodynamics), relating the energy, angular velocity and angular momentum of nearby equilibrium configurations."

        "Abstract": "As a result of a systematic NIR H-band (1.65 micron) imaging survey of normal galaxies in the local universe, we are able to measure in a highly homogeneous way photometric and structural properties for a sample of 1143 galaxies. We base our analysis on a quantitative structural parameter, the concentration index C_31, instead of relying on the galaxies' morphological classification. The C_31 parameter provides a model independent, quantitative and continuous characterization of the light distribution within galaxies, and it is thus to be preferred to either the Hubble type or a parameter like the bulge-to-disk or bulge-to-total light ratio. We find that galaxies can be completely described by three parameters, namely: a scale parameter (the H-band luminosity), a shape parameter (the concentration index C_31) and a colour parameter (e.g. the B-H colour). At low luminosity dEs and dIs, having similar C_31, are colour-discriminated, while at very high luminosity different C_31 discriminate S0s from Scs, otherwise undistinguishable on the basis of their colour. A single, monotonic relation exists between luminosity and mu_e in the H-band, as opposed to the two separate regimes that are generally observed in the B-band. As NIR luminosity traces quite accurately the galaxy mass distribution, this relation re-enforces the indication in favour of a scale-dependent mass collapse mechanism which produces higher surface-brightness and more centrally peaked galaxies with increasing mass. However, the presence of high-luminosity low-C_31 galaxies hints at other machanisms and physical properties (such as angular momentum) playing an important role in galaxy formation. (abridged)"

We study electric and magnetic fields with three possible orientations: radial (R), longitudinal (L) and azimuthal (A), and try to find solitonic stringlike solutions, having a regular axis and a flat metric at large $r$, with a possible angular defect. Assuming the function $\\Phi(F)$ to be regular at small $F$, it is shown that a regular axis is impossible in R-fields if there is a nonzero effective electric charge and in A-fields if there is a nonzero effective electric current along the axis. Solitonic solutions are only possible for purely magnetic R-fields and purely electric A-fields, in cases when $\\Phi(F)$ tends to a finite limit at large $F$. For both R- and A-fields, the desired large $r$ asymptotic is only possible with a non- Maxwell behaviour of $\\Phi(F)$ at small $F$. For L-fields, solutions with a regular axis are easily obtained (and can be found by quadratures) whereas a desired large $r$ asymptotic is only possible in an exceptional solution; the latter gives rise to solitonic configurations in case $\\Phi(F) = \\const \\cdot \\sqrt{F}$.

We consider an ad hoc Gauss-Markov (GM) process for approximating the process $X(t)$ and we specify a bound for the $L^2$-distance between the processes. We also prove that the upper bound allows to obtain an estimation of the probability that the process $X(t)$ is close to a time-varying boundary (the firing threshold) by means of the distribution function of the first passage time of the GM process. The bounds are evaluated in the cases where $Z(t)$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, a Poisson process, a compound Poisson process or a shot noise.

We focus on a specific class of invariants known as nonzero determinant link invariants, defined only for links which do not evaluate to zero on the link determinant. We restate our objective by considering a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of links subject to the condition that if any three nonzero determinant links belong to a skein triangle, any two of these belonging to $\\mathcal{S}$ implies that the third also belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$. Then we aim to determine a minimal set of initial generators so that $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all links with nonzero determinant.

For oriented skein triangles, we show that the unknot and Hopf link orientations form a set of generators."

It is shown that the most probable frequency of a carrier wave which constitutes the solitary wave is the frequency where the growth rate of modulation instability is maximal. An envelope solitary wave of this frequency can be described by the conventional nonlinear Schrodinger equation. A soliton solution to this equation is presented for the time-like version of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. When such envelope soliton enters a coastal zone where the bottom gradually linearly increases, then it experiences an adiabatical transformation. This leads to an increase of soliton amplitude, velocity, and period of a carrier wave, whereas its duration decreases. It is shown that the soliton becomes taller and narrower. At some distance it looks like a breather, a narrow nonstationary solitary wave. The dependences of soliton parameters on the distance when it moves towards the shoaling are found from the conservation laws and analysed graphically. Estimates for the real ocean are presented."

        "Abstract": "A generalized vector particle theory with the use of an extended set of Lorentz group irredicible representations, including scalar, two 4-vectors, and antisymmetric 2-rang tensor, is investigated. Initial equations depend upon four complex parameters $\\lambda_{i}$, obeying two supplementary conditions, so restriction of the model to the case of electrically neutral vector particle is not a trivial task. A special basis in the space of 15-component wave functions is found where instead of four $\\lambda_{i}$ only one real-valued quantity $\\sigma$, a bilinear combination of $\\lambda_{i}$, is presented. This $\\lambda$-parameter is interpreted as an additional electromagnetic characteristic of a charged vector particle, polarizability. It is shown that in this basis $C$-operation is reduced to the complex conjugation only, without any accompanying linear transformation. Restriction to a massless vector particle is determined.   Extension of the whole theory to the case of Riemannian space-time is accomplished. Two methods of obtaining corresponding generally covariant wave equations are elaborated: of tensor- and of tetrad-based ones. Their equivalence is proved. It is shown that in case of pure curved space-time models without Cartan torsion no specific additional interaction terms because of non-flat geometry arise. The conformal symmetry of a massless generally covariant equation is demonstrated explicitly. A canonical tensor of energy-momentum $T_{\\beta \\alpha}$ is constructed, its conservation law happens to involves the Riemann curvature tensor. Within the framework of known ambiguity of any energy-momentum tensor, a new tensor $\\bar{T}_{\\beta \\alpha}$ is suggested to be used, which obeys a common conservation law."

The research presented here is intended to be a step towards this vision. We describe a computational simulation of nanoscale machines floating in a virtual liquid. The machines can bond together to form strands (chains) that self-replicate and self-assemble into user-specified meshes. There are four types of machines and the sequence of machine types in a strand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured in the simulation, by simply changing the sequence of machine types in the seed."

Recent results show multiple advantages of using deterministic automata in symbolic and bounded model checking of LTL safety properties. In this paper, we present a technique with a supporting tool that takes a sequential extended regular expression specification {\\Phi}, and a logic design implementation S, and generates a sequential circuit C, expressed as an And-Inverted-Graph, that checks whether S satisfies {\\Phi}.

In this work, we provide such entanglement with a consistent theoretical description as a quantum resource in processes frequently encountered in optical and cold-atom systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that identical particle entanglement is even a useful resource, being precisely the property resulting in directly usable entanglement from such systems when distributed to separated parties, with particle conservation laws in play. The utility of our results is demonstrated by a quantitative analysis of a recent experiment on Bose-Einstein condensates. This work is hoped to bring clarity to the debate with a unifying conceptual and practical understanding of entanglement between identical particles."

We identify four possible modes of motion, depending on whether (i) the robots move in straight lines or following their cable lines; (ii) the robots move sequentially or concurrently. We present an in-depth analysis of Straight & Concurrent, which is the most practically-interesting mode of motion.

The intertwining with the world is accomplished by integrating these two modes of an entity s being: being a thing that flows through machines and being a machine that processes things. This paper further enriches these notions of things and machines. We present further exploration of the thinging machine model through introducing a new notion called the thing/machine (thimac) as a label of the unity of things/machines.

For coupled three qubits interacting with a photon field, a realizable scheme for a single-step Toffoli gate is investigated. We find that the three qubit system can be described by four effective modified Jaynes-Cummings models in the states of two control qubits. Within the rotating wave approximation, the modified Jaynes-Cummings models are shown to be reduced to the conventional Jaynes-Cummings models with renormalized couplings between qubits and photon fields. A single-step Toffoli gate is shown to be realizable with tuning the four characteristic oscillation periods that satisfy a commensurate condition. Possible values of system parameters are estimated for single-step Toffli gate. From numerical calculation, further, our single-step Toffoli gate operation errors are discussed due to imperfections in system parameters, which shows that a Toffoli gate with high fidelity can be obtained by adjusting pairs of the photon-qubit and the qubit-qubit coupling strengthes. In addition, a decoherence effect on the Toffoli gate operation is discussed due to a thermal reservoir."

However, a fast convergence to the optimal solution can only be ensured with the use of problem-specific sampling distributions. Due to the large variety of driving situations within the context of automated driving, it is very challenging to manually design such distributions. This paper introduces therefore a data-driven approach utilizing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN): Given the current driving situation, future ego-vehicle poses can be directly generated from the output of the CNN allowing to guide the motion planner efficiently towards the optimal solution. A benchmark highlights that the CNN predicts future vehicle poses with a higher accuracy compared to uniform sampling and a state-of-the-art A*-based approach. Combining this CNN-guided sampling with the motion planner Bidirectional RRT* reduces the computation time by up to an order of magnitude and yields a faster convergence to a lower cost as well as a success rate of 100 % in the tested scenarios."

        "Abstract": "We consider a planar Coulomb gas in which the external potential is generated by a smeared uniform background of opposite-sign charge on a disc. This model can be seen as a two-dimensional Wigner jellium, not necessarily charge neutral, and with particles allowed to exist beyond the support of the smeared charge. The full space integrability condition requires low enough temperature or high enough total smeared charge. This condition does not allow at the same time, total charge neutrality and determinantal structure. The model shares similarities with both the complex Ginibre ensemble and the Forrester--Krishnapur spherical ensemble of random matrix theory. In particular, for a certain regime of temperature and total charge, the equilibrium measure is uniform on a disc as in the Ginibre ensemble, while the modulus of the farthest particle has heavy-tailed fluctuations as in the Forrester--Krishnapur spherical ensemble. We also touch on a higher temperature regime producing a crossover equilibrium measure, as well as a transition to Gumbel edge fluctuations. More results in the same spirit on edge fluctuations are explored by the second author together with Raphael Butez."

        "Abstract": "The data required for heterotic string theory with gauge group G, which for anomaly cancellation reasons must either be E8 x E8 or Spin(32)/Z2, consist of the following: a ten-dimensional space-time X and a principal G-bundle P. The fields in the theory consist of: a metric on X, a connection on P and a B-field which is, roughly speaking, a two-form on X. As in a gauge theory, these fields are considered up to gauge equivalence. This means that the connection is considered up to bundle isomorphism, that the metric is considered up to diffeomorphism equivalence, and that the two-form B is considered up to equivalence by adding exact two-forms. The fact that B has a gauge invariance implies that it is not in fact a globally defined two-form but rather must be given as a gerbe-like object. The purpose of this paper is to give a precise definition of the mathematical nature of the B-field following the recent work of Freed and then to work out a description of the moduli space of 8-dimensional Euclidean invariant classical solutions to the string Equations of Motion in the case when space-time is compactified along a two-torus."

        "Title": "Neutrino ground state in a dense star",
        "Abstract": "It has recently been argued that long range forces due to the exchange of massless neutrinos give rise to a very large self-energy in a dense, finite-ranged, weakly-charged medium. Such an effect, if real, would destabilize a neutron star. To address this issue we have studied the related problem of a massless neutrino field in the presence of an external, static electroweak potential of finite range. To be precise, we have computed to one loop the exact vacuum energy for the case of a spherical square well potential of depth alpha and radius R. For small wells, the vacuum energy is reliably determined by a perturbative expansion in the external potential. For large wells, however, the perturbative expansion breaks down. A manifestation of this breakdown is that the vacuum carries a non-zero neutrino charge. The energy and neutrino charge of the ground state are, to a good approximation for large wells, those of a neutrino condensate with chemical potential mu=alpha. Our results demonstrate explicitly that long-range forces due to the exchange of massless neutrinos do not threaten the stability of neutron stars."

Information from anatomical shape and tabular clinical data (demographics, biomarkers) are fused in a single neural network. The network is invariant to shape transformations and avoids the need to identify point correspondences between shapes. To account for right censored time-to-event data, i.e., when it is only known that a patient did not develop Alzheimer's disease up to a particular time point, we employ a loss commonly used in survival analysis. Our network is trained end-to-end to combine information from a patient's hippocampus shape and clinical biomarkers. Our experiments on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative demonstrate that our proposed model is able to learn a shape descriptor that augments clinical biomarkers and outperforms a deep neural network on shape alone and a linear model on common clinical biomarkers."

        "Abstract": "Results from string theory conclude that a spatial dimension R is equivalent to *'/R. If R is considered as a four-space dimension, several interesting results emerge. In this paradigm, *'/R exists in a time-reversed, \"anti- parallel\" universe. Cosmological distances in our real-time universe are equivalent to the compact dimensions at the instant of a Big Bang in a time- inverted universe. This model agrees with standard black hole theory in that particles become frozen in time when they reach the 'singularity' (of dimension alpha'). A particle which enters a black hole in real time exits from the Big Bang or \"white hole\" in the time-inverted universe, leaving behind a trace of annihilation radiation. A diagram of this phenomenon is constructed, consistent with existing knowledge of the early universe. The primordeal black holes predicted by Hawking are required. A cyclic universe is described by M^2\\p,n + T^2\\n = 1. The \"missing mass\" proscribed by standard closed- universe theories is not required. This result is useful if experimental evidence in the search for dark matter continues to leave a significant \"missing mass\" - and particularly in light of more recent observations indicating that, in fact, inflation continues at a much reduced rate."

A coherent period of 85.82 min is present in the EUVE Deep Survey imager light curve of this source. A spectroscopic identification is made with a 19th magnitude blue star that has H and He emission lines, and broad cyclotron humps typical of a magnetic cataclysmic variable. A lower limit to the polar magnetic field of 46 MG is estimated from the spacing of the cyclotron harmonics. EUVE J0425.6-5714 is also detected in archival ROSAT HRI observations spanning two months, and its stable and highly structured light curve permits us to fit a coherent ephemeris linking the ROSAT and EUVE data over a 1.3 yr gap. The derived period is 85.82107 +/- 0.00020 min, and the ephemeris should be accurate to 0.1 cycles until the year 2005. A narrow but partial X-ray eclipse suggests that this object belongs to the group of Am Her stars whose viewing geometry is such that the accretion stream periodically occults the soft X-ray emitting accretion spot on the surface of the white dwarf. A non-detection of hard X-rays from ASCA observations that are contemporaneous with the ROSAT HRI shows that the soft X-rays must dominate by at least an order of magnitude, which is consistent with a known trend among AM Her stars with large magnetic field. This object should not be confused with the Seyfert galaxy 1H 0419-577 (= LB 1727), another X-ray/EUV source which lies only 4' away, and was the principal target of these monitoring observations."

        "Abstract": "It has been argued that a central objective of nanotechnology is to make products inexpensively, and that self-replication is an effective approach to very low-cost manufacturing. The research presented here is intended to be a step towards this vision. We describe a computational simulation of nanoscale machines floating in a virtual liquid. The machines can bond together to form strands (chains) that self-replicate and self-assemble into user-specified meshes. There are four types of machines and the sequence of machine types in a strand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured in the simulation, by simply changing the sequence of machine types in the seed."

        "Abstract": "Answer set programming (ASP) with disjunction offers a powerful tool for declaratively representing and solving hard problems. Many NP-complete problems can be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise and intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical \"guess and check\" nature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial size certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the problem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond NP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. While these problems also have a clear \"guess and check\" structure, finding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a non-obvious task, in particular if the \"check\" itself is a coNP-complete problem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and check programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check program. In this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free (extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended) disjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. The answer sets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence, and, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a designated answer set of the transformed program. Our transformations facilitate the integration of separate \"guess\" and \"check\" programs, which are often easy to obtain, automatically into a single disjunctive logic program. Our results complement recent results on meta-interpretation in ASP, and extend methods and techniques for a declarative \"guess and check\" problem solving paradigm through ASP."

        "Abstract": "The properties of a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) superconductor with {\\it an open Fermi surface} are expected to be unusual in a magnetic field. On the one hand, the quasi-1D structure of the Fermi surface strongly favors the formation of a non-uniform state (Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state) in the presence of a magnetic field acting on the electron spins. On the other hand, a magnetic field acting on an open Fermi surface induces a dimensional crossover by confining the electronic wave-functions wave-functions along the chains of highest conductivity, which results in a divergence of the orbital critical field and in a stabilization at low temperature of a cascade of superconducting phases separated by first order transistions. In this paper, we study the phase diagram as a function of the anisotropy. We discuss in details the experimental situation in the quasi-1D organic conductors of the Bechgaard salts family and argue that they appear as good candidates for the observation of the LOFF state, provided that their anisotropy is large enough. Recent experiments on the organic quasi-1D superconductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ are in agreement with the results obtained in this paper and could be interpreted as a signature of a high-field superconducting phase. We also point out the possibility to observe a LOFF state in some quasi-2D organic superconductors."

In particular we analyse here the BeppoSAX broad band (0.1-100 keV) data of 4 objects which, despite their X-ray brightness, have been historically poorly studied due to their late identification with an AGN; these are H0111-149 (MKN1152), H0235-525 (ESO198-G24), H0557-385 (IRAS F05563-3820) and H1846-786 (IRAS F18389-7834). We have assumed for all the sources a baseline model which includes a power law with an exponential cut-off plus a reflection component and an iron K_alpha line; we have also searched for the presence of intrinsic absorption and/or a soft excess component. Our analysis indicates the presence of complex absorption in two objects (H0557-385 and H0111-149) best described by a combination of two uniform absorbers, one cold and one warm. Only in one source, H0557-385, a soft excess component has been measured. The primary continuum is best described by a canonical power law (Gamma=1.7-2) with a high energy cut-off in the range 40-130 keV. A cold reflection component is likely present in all sources with values ranging from less than 0.6 to higher than 2. In 3 out of 4 objects we find a cold iron line having equivalent width typical of Seyfert 1s (100-200 eV)."

As a consequence, they were proposed as an alternative to Goppa codes for the McEliece cryptosystem, resulting to a potential reduction of key sizes.   In this paper, an efficient key-recovery attack is given on this variant of the McEliece cryptosystem. The algorithm is based on the recovery of the structure of subfield subcodes of twisted Reed--Solomon codes, and it always succeeds. Its correctness is proved, and it is shown that the attack breaks the system for all practical parameters in $O(n^4)$ field operations. A practical implementation is also provided and retrieves a valid private key from the public key within just a few minutes, for parameters claiming a security level of $128$ bits.   We also discuss a potential repair of the scheme and an application of the attack to GPT cryptosystems using twisted Gabidulin codes."

The models studied include not only a spherically symmetric hot matter shell with constant particle number but also a black hole characterized by a general thermal equation of state. These examples illustrate the formal structure of thermodynamics developed by Callen as applied to a gravitational configuration as well as the phenomenological manner in which Einstein equations largely determine the thermodynamical equations of state. We consider in detail the thermodynamics and quasi-static collapse of a self-gravitating shell. This includes a discussion of intrinsic stability for a one-parameter family of thermal equations of state and the interpretation of the Bekenstein bound. The entropy growth associated with a collapsing sequence of equilibrium states of a shell is computed under different boundary conditions in the quasi-static approximation and compared with black hole entropy. Although explicit expressions involve empirical coefficients, these are constrained by physical conditions of thermodynamical origin. The absence of a Gibbs-Duhem relation and the associated scaling laws for self-gravitating matter systems are presented."

In this context a class of experiments has recently been proposed, where the non-classicality of a physical system can be tested indirectly by detecting whether or not it is capable of entangling two quantum probes. Here we illustrate some of its subtleties and perform proof-of-principle experiments using a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) quantum computational platform with four qubits."

Restricting $\\tau$ to the set of maximal Abelian ideals yields the above-mentioned correspondence; 3) Each fibre of $\\tau$ is a poset in its own right, and we prove that this fibre has a unique maximal and a unique minimal element. 4) An explicit description of the minimal and the maximal ideal corresponding to a long root is given."

        "Abstract": "We report results from simultaneous ASCA and RXTE observations of Cyg X-1 when the source made a rare transition from the hard (= low) state to the soft (= high) state in 1996. These observations together cover a broad energy range ~0.7--50 keV with a moderate energy resolution at the iron K-band, thus make it possible to disentangle various spectral components. The low-energy spectrum is dominated by an ultra-soft component, which is likely to be the emission from the hottest inner portion of the accretion disk around the black hole. At high energies, the X-ray spectrum can be described by a Comptonized spectrum with a reflection component. The Compton corona, which upscatters soft ``seed photons'' to produce the hard X-ray emission, is found to have a y-parameter ~0.28. The hard X-ray emission illuminates the accretion disk and the re-emitted photons produce the observed ``reflection bump''. We show that the reflecting medium subtends only a small solid angle ($\\sim 0.15\\times 2\\pi$), but has a large ionization parameter such that iron is ionized up to \\ion{Fe}{24}-\\ion{Fe}{26}. The presence of a broad iron line at $6.58\\pm0.04$ keV is also consistent with a highly ionized disk, if we take into account the gravitational and Doppler shift of the line energy. These results imply a geometry with a central corona surrounding the black hole and the reflection occurring in the innermost region of the disk where matter is highly ionized."

Specifically, our main result is to obtain for the first time the classical $r$-matrix structure within a covariant Poisson bracket for the Lax connection, or Lax one form. This exhibits a certain covariant nature of the classical $r$-matrix with respect to the underlying spacetime variables. The main result is established by means of several prototypical examples of integrable field theories, all equipped with a Zakharov-Shabat type Lax pair. Full details are presented for: $a)$ the sine-Gordon model which provides a relativistic example associated to a classical $r$-matrix of trigonometric type; $b)$ the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and the (complex) modified Korteweg-de Vries equation which provide two non-relativistic examples associated to the same classical $r$-matrix of rational type, characteristic of the AKNS hierarchy. The appearance of the $r$-matrix in a covariant Poisson bracket is a signature of the integrability of the field theory in a way that puts the independent variables on equal footing. This is in sharp contrast with the single-time Hamiltonian evolution context usually associated to the $r$-matrix formalism."

Here we consider \"local\" biasing models, in which the galaxy density field $\\delta_g$ at a point is a function of the matter density field $\\delta$ at that point: $\\delta_g = f(\\delta)$. We consider both deterministic biasing, where $f$ is simply a function, and stochastic biasing, in which the galaxy density is a random variable whose distribution depends on the matter density: $\\delta_g=X(\\delta)$. We show that even when this mapping is performed on a highly nonlinear density field with a hierarchical correlation structure, the correlation function $\\xi$ is simply scaled up by a constant, as long as $\\xi << 1$. In stochastic biasing models, the galaxy autocorrelation function behaves exactly as in deterministic models, with the mean value of $X$ for a given value of $\\delta$ taking the role of the deterministic bias function. We extend our results to the power spectrum P(k), showing that for sufficiently small k, the effect of local biasing is equivalent to the multiplication of P(k) by a constant, with the addition of a constant term. If a cosmological model predicts a large-scale mass correlation function in conflict with the shape of the observed galaxy correlation function, then the model cannot be rescued by appealing to a complicated but local relation between galaxies and mass."

We then treat the Nash equilibrium computation problem within the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. Building upon recent developments in scenario-based optimization, we accompany the computed Nash equilibrium with a priori and a posteriori probabilistic robustness certificates, providing confidence that the computed equilibrium remains unaffected (in probabilistic terms) when a new uncertainty realization is encountered. For a wide class of games, we also show that the computation of the so called compression set - which is at the core of the scenario approach theory - can be directly obtained as a byproduct of the proposed solution methodology. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in an electric vehicle charging control problem."

While generally different, for a unique and non-trivial choice of rates (up to a rescaling of time) the velocity rate functions for the two models become identical, whereas the effective processes generating the fluctuations remain distinct.

We demonstrate that the dynamics of the FRW model with dark energy in the form of phantom field can be regarded as a scattering process of two types: multiple chaotic and classical non-chaotic. It depends whether the spontaneously symmetry breaking takes place. In the first class of models with the spontaneously symmetry breaking the dynamics is similar to the Yang-Mills theory. We find the evidence of a fractal structure in the phase space of initial conditions. We observe similarities to the phenomenon of a multiple scattering process around the origin. In turn the class of models without the spontaneously symmetry breaking can be described as the classical non-chaotic scattering process and the methods of symbolic dynamic are also used in this case. We show that the phantom cosmology can be treated as a simple model with scattering of trajectories which character depends crucially on a sign of a square of mass. We demonstrate that there is a possibility of chaotic behavior in the flat Universe with a conformally coupled phantom field in the system considered on non-zero energy level. We obtain that the acceleration is a generic feature in the considered model without the spontaneously symmetry breaking.

The proposed interface is an interactive cursor-based algorithm for collecting experimental data about temporal saliency. We collect the first human responses and perform their analysis. As a result, we show that qualitatively, the produced scores have very explicit meaning of the semantic changes in a frame, while quantitatively being highly correlated between all the observers. Apart from that, we show that the proposed tool can simultaneously collect fixations similar to the ones produced by eye-tracker in a more affordable way. Further, this approach may be used for creation of first temporal saliency datasets which will allow training computational predictive algorithms. The proposed interface does not rely on any special equipment, which allows to run it remotely and cover a wide audience."

Specifically, by viewing each of the first-layer fuzzy systems as a weak estimator of the output based only on a very small portion of the input variables, we design these fuzzy systems using the WM Method. After the first-layer fuzzy systems are designed, we pass the data through the first layer to form a new data set and design the second-layer fuzzy systems based on this new data set in the same way as designing the first-layer fuzzy systems. Repeating this process layer-by-layer we design the whole DCFS. We also propose a DCFS with parameter sharing to save memory and computation. We apply the DCFS models to predict a synthetic chaotic plus random time-series and the real Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong stock market."

The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

        "Abstract": "We present an algorithm for learning from unlabeled text, based on the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information retrieval, that can solve verbal analogy questions of the kind found in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). A verbal analogy has the form A:B::C:D, meaning \"A is to B as C is to D\"; for example, mason:stone::carpenter:wood. SAT analogy questions provide a word pair, A:B, and the problem is to select the most analogous word pair, C:D, from a set of five choices. The VSM algorithm correctly answers 47% of a collection of 374 college-level analogy questions (random guessing would yield 20% correct). We motivate this research by relating it to work in cognitive science and linguistics, and by applying it to a difficult problem in natural language processing, determining semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs. The problem is to classify a noun-modifier pair, such as \"laser printer\", according to the semantic relation between the noun (printer) and the modifier (laser). We use a supervised nearest-neighbour algorithm that assigns a class to a given noun-modifier pair by finding the most analogous noun-modifier pair in the training data. With 30 classes of semantic relations, on a collection of 600 labeled noun-modifier pairs, the learning algorithm attains an F value of 26.5% (random guessing: 3.3%). With 5 classes of semantic relations, the F value is 43.2% (random: 20%). The performance is state-of-the-art for these challenging problems."

The reliability of an edge is the probability that no failure occurs on that edge, whereas the reliability of a path is the product of the reliabilities of the edges in such path. The problem has relevant applications in the design of networks, in fields such as telecommunications, electricity and transports.

Unlike wider reduced precision neural network models, we preserve the train-time parameter count, thus out-performing XNOR-Nets without a train-time memory penalty. Such training routines could see great utility in semi-supervised online learning tasks. Our method also offers advantages in model compression, as we reduce the model size of ResNet-18 by 7.43 times with respect to a full precision model without utilizing any other compression techniques. We also demonstrate a 'Hadamard Binary Matrix Multiply' kernel, which delivers a 10-fold increase in performance over full precision matrix multiplication with a similarly optimized kernel."

The approach builds upon two components: 1) a robust detector that uses recurrent deep neural networks to dynamically detect a variety of situations of interest, such as zero velocity or no lateral slip; and 2) a state-of-the-art Kalman filter which incorporates this knowledge as pseudo-measurements for localization. Evaluations on a publicly available car dataset demonstrates that the proposed scheme may achieve a final precision of 20 m for a 21 km long trajectory of a vehicle driving for over an hour, equipped with an IMU of moderate precision (the gyro drift rate is 10 deg/h). To our knowledge, this is the first paper which combines sophisticated deep learning techniques with state-of-the-art filtering methods for pure inertial navigation on wheeled vehicles and as such opens up for novel data-driven inertial navigation techniques. Moreover, albeit taylored for IMU-only based localization, our method may be used as a component for self-localization of wheeled robots equipped with a more complete sensor suite."

We show that the resolvent of $H$ admits a meromorphic extension from the upper half-plane to an appropriate complex manifold ${\\mathcal M}$, and define the resonances of $H$ as the poles of this meromorphic extension. We study their distribution near any fixed Landau level $2bq$, $q \\in {\\mathbb N}$. First, we obtain a sharp upper bound of the number of resonances in a vicinity of $2bq$. Moreover, under appropriate hypotheses, we establish corresponding lower bounds which imply the existence of an infinite number of resonances, or the absence of resonances in certain sectors adjoining $2bq$. Finally, we deduce a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair $(H,H_0)$ as a sum of a harmonic measure related to the resonances, and the imaginary part of a holomorphic function. This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner approximation, implies a trace formula, and provides information on the singularities of the SSF at the Landau levels."

Training is performed by calculating the forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations of outputted devices and using the subsequent efficiency gradients for backpropagation. With metagratings operating across a range of wavelengths and angles as a model system, we show that devices produced from the trained generative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best devices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less computational cost. Our reframing of adjoint-based optimization to the training of a generative neural network applies generally to physical systems that can utilize gradients to improve performance."

String-net models are usually considered for spherical fusion categories, and in this case the vector spaces agree with the state spaces of the corresponding Turaev-Viro topological quantum field theory.   In the present work some effects of dropping the sphericality condition are investigated. In one example of non-spherical pivotal fusion categories, the string-net space counts the number of r-spin structures on a surface and carries an isomorphic representation of the mapping class group. Another example concerns the string-net space of a sphere with one marked point labelled by a simple object Z of the Drinfeld centre. This space is found to be non-zero iff Z is isomorphic to a non-unit simple object determined by the non-spherical pivotal structure.   The last example mirrors the effect of deforming the stress tensor of a two-dimensional conformal field theory, such as in the topological twist of a supersymmetric theory."

The northern feature, presumed to be associated with a jet moving away from the Earth, shows strong evidence for free-free absorption. The ionized gas responsible for that absorption would be a source of detectable stimulated recombination line emission for a wide range of physical conditions. The VLBA has been used to search for the H65$\\alpha$ hydrogen recombination line. The line is only expected to be seen against the northern feature which contains a small fraction of the total radio flux density. This spatial discrimination significantly aids the search for a weak line. No line was seen, with upper limits of roughly 15% of the continuum over a velocity range of 1486 km/s with resolutions up to 6.6 km/s. In the absence of a strong radiation field, this would imply that the free-free absorbing gas has a wide velocity width, is moving rapidly relative to the systemic velocity, or is concentrated in a thin, high density structure. All of these possibilities are reasonably likely close to an AGN. However, in the intense radiation environment of the AGN, even considering only the radiation we actually observe passing through the free-free absorbing gas, the non-detection is probably assured by a combination of saturation and radiation damping."

The image of the positive part of the unit ball under Psi is called the spectral scale of {b_1, .., b_n} relative to tau and is denoted by B. In a previous paper with Nik Weaver we showed that the geometry of B reflects spectral data for real linear combinations of the operators {b_1, .., b_n}. For example, we showed that an exposed face in B is determined by a certain pair of spectral projections of a real linear combination of {b_1, .., b_n}. In the present paper we extend this study to faces that are not exposed. We completely describe the structure of arbitrary faces of B in terms of {b_1, .., b_n} and tau. We also study faces of convex, compact sets that are exposed by more than one hyperplane of support. Although many of the conclusions of this study involve too much notation to fit nicely in an abstract, there are two results that give their flavor very well. Let N be the algebra generated by {b_1, ..., b_n} and the identity. Theorem 6.1: If the set of extreme points of B is countable, then N is abelian.

To any complex torus equipped with a flat Kahler metric and a closed 2-form we associate an N=2 superconformal vertex algebra (N=2 SCVA) in the sense of our definition. We find a criterion for two different tori to produce isomorphic N=2 SCVA's. We show that for algebraic tori isomorphism of N=2 SCVA's implies the equivalence of the derived categories of coherent sheaves corresponding to the tori or their noncommutative generalizations (Azumaya algebras over tori). We also find a criterion for two different tori to produce N=2 SCVA's related by a mirror morphism. If the 2-form is of type (1,1), this condition is identical to the one proposed by Golyshev, Lunts, and Orlov, who used an entirely different approach inspired by the Homological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture of Kontsevich. Our results suggest that Kontsevich's conjecture must be modified: coherent sheaves must be replaced with modules over Azumaya algebras, and the Fukaya category must be ``twisted'' by a closed 2-form.

The method is based on sampling Gaussian fields which are compatible with a galaxy distribution and a structure formation model. This is achieved by splitting the inversion problem into two Gibbs-sampling steps: the first being a Gaussianisation step transforming a distribution of point sources at Lagrangian positions -which are not a priori given- into a linear alias-free Gaussian field. This step is based on Hamiltonian sampling with a Gaussian-Poisson model. The second step consists on a likelihood comparison in which the set of matter tracers at the initial conditions is constrained on the galaxy distribution and the assumed structure formation model. For computational reasons second order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory is used. However, the presented approach is flexible to adopt any structure formation model. A semi-analytic halo-model based galaxy mock catalog is taken to demonstrate that the recovered initial conditions are closely unbiased with respect to the actual ones from the corresponding N-body simulation down to scales of a ~ 5 Mpc/h. The cross-correlation between them shows a substantial gain of information, being at k ~ 0.3 h/Mpc more than doubled. In addition the initial conditions are extremely well Gaussian distributed and the power-spectra follow the shape of the linear power-spectrum being very close to the actual one from the simulation down to scales of k ~ 1 h/Mpc."

Our alternative proof is a simple consequence of a new characterization of the monotonicity of a quotient map $p\\colon K\\to L$ between locally connected compact spaces $K$ and $L$ that we obtain by characterizing the local connectedness of $K$ in terms of the Banach lattice $\\mathrm{C}(K)$."

Star-forming complexes are identified as bright lumps in B-band galaxy images and isolated by means of the unsharp-masking method. For the sample as a whole the radial number distribution of bright lumps largely traces the underlying exponential-disk light profiles, but peaks at a 10 percent smaller scale length. Moreover, the presence of a tail of star forming regions out to at least six optical scale lengths provides evidence against a systematic star formation truncation within that galaxy extension. Considering these findings, we apply a scale length-independent concentration index, taking into account the implied non-uniform random spread of star formation regions throughout the disk. The number profiles frequently manifest a second, minor peak at about two scale lengths. Relying on a two-dimensional stochastic self-propagating star formation model, we show these secondary peaks to be consistent with triggered star formation; for a few of the brighter galaxies a peculiar peak distribution is observed that is conceivably due to the onset of shear provided by differential rotation. On scales between 100 and 1000 pc, and by taking into account exponential-disk structure, bright lumps reveal cluster dimensions between 1.3 and 2, with a weak trend to higher dimensions for brighter galaxies. Interpreting cluster dimension in terms of porosity of a self-similar intragalactic medium, we derive a relation between current star formation rate, scale length, and porosity."

After a review of the fundamental features characterizing the inflationary model, as referred to a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, we develop a generalization in view of including small inhomogeneous corrections in the theory. A second step in our discussion is devoted to show that the inflationary scenario provides a valuable dynamical ``bridge'' between a generic Kasner-like regime and a homogeneous and isotropic Universe in the horizon scale. This result is achieved by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a Bianchi IX model in the presence of a cosmological space-dependent term. In this respect, we construct a quasi-isotropic inflationary solution based on the expansion of the Einstein equations up to first-two orders of approximation, in which the isotropy of the Universe is due to the dominance of the scalar field kinetic term; the first order of approximation corresponds to the inhomogeneous corrections and is driven by the matter evolution. We show how such a quasi-isotropic solution contains a certain freedom in fixing the space functions involved in the problem. The main physical issue of this analysis corresponds to outline the impossibility for the classical origin of density perturbations, due to the exponential decay of the matter term during the de Sitter phase."

From a rigorous viewpoint non coinciding upper and lower bounds on the critical line are known.   In this paper we combine numerical computations with rigorous arguments to get to a better understanding of the phase diagram. Our main results include:   - Various numerical observations that suggest that the critical line lies strictly in between the two bounds.   - A rigorous statistical test based on concentration inequalities and super-additivity, for determining whether a given point of the phase diagram is in the localized phase. This is applied in particular to show that, with a very low level of error, the lower bound does not coincide with the critical line.   - An analysis of the precise asymptotic behavior of the partition function in the delocalized phase, with particular attention to the effect of rare atypical stretches in the disorder sequence and on whether or not in the delocalized regime the polymer path has a Brownian scaling.   - A new proof of the lower bound on the critical line.

In particular, three types of traps may occur, depending on the fine properties of the tails of the conductances: (i) a very large conductance (a well in the potential); (ii) a very small conductance (a wall in the potential); (iii) the combination of a large conductance followed shortly after by a small conductance (a well-and-wall in the potential)."

        "Title": "Collisionless dynamics of the condensate predicted in the random phase  approximation",
        "Abstract": "From the microscopic theory, we derive a number conserving quantum kinetic equation, valid for a dilute Bose gas at any temperature, in which the binary collisions between the quasi-particles are mediated by phonon-like excitations (called ``condenson''). This different approach starts from the many-body Hamiltonian of a Boson gas and uses, in an appropriate way, the generalized random phase approximation. As a result, the collision term of the kinetic equation contains higher order contributions in the expansion in the interaction parameter. This different expansion shows up that a scattering involves the emission and the absorption of a phonon-like excitation. The major interest of this particular mechanism is that, in a regime where the condensate is stable, the collision process between condensed and non condensed particles is totally blocked due to a total annihilation of the mutual interaction potential induced by the condensate itself. As a consequence, the condensate is not constrained to relax and can be superfluid. Furthermore, a Boltzmann-like H-theorem for the entropy exists for this equation and allows to distinguish between dissipative and non dissipative phenomena (like vortices). We also illustrate the analogy between this approach and the kinetic theory for a plasma, in which the excitations correspond precisely to a plasmon. Finally, we show the equivalence of this theory with the non-number conserving Bogoliubov theory at zero temperature."

        "Abstract": "In this note we present a reconstructive algorithm for solving the cross-sectional pipe area from boundary measurements in a tree network with one inaccessbile end. This is equivalent to reconstructing the first order perturbation to a wave equation on a quantum graph from boundary measurements at all network ends except one. The method presented here is based on a time reversal boundary control method originally presented by Sondhi and Gopinath for one dimensional problems and later by Oksanen to higher dimensional manifolds. The algorithm is local, so is applicable to complicated networks if we are interested only in a part isomorphic to a tree. Moreover the numerical implementation requires only one matrix inversion or least squares minimization per discretization point in the physical network. We present a theoretical solution existence proof, a step-by-step algorithm, and a numerical implementation applied to two numerical experiments."

        "Abstract": "We discovered an X-ray cluster in a Chandra observation of the compact steep spectrum (CSS) radio source 1321+045 (z=0.263). CSS sources are thought to be young radio objects at the beginning of their evolution and can potentially test the cluster heating process. 1321+045 is a relatively low luminosity source and its morphology consists of two radio lobes on the opposite sides of a radio core with no evidence for jets or hotspots. The optical emission line ratios are consistent with an interstellar medium (ISM) dominated by AGN-photoionization with a small contribution from star formation, and no contributions from shocks. Based on these ratios, we classify 1321+045 as a low excitation galaxy (LEG) and suggest that its radio activity is in a coasting phase. The X-ray emission associated with the radio source is detected with 36.1+/-8.3 counts, but the origin of this emission is highly uncertain. The current X-ray image of the cluster does not show any signatures of a radio source impact on the cluster medium. Chandra detects the cluster emission at >3 sigma level out to ~60 arcsec (~240 kpc). We obtain the best fit beta model parameters of the surface brightness profile of beta=0.58+/-0.2 and a core radius of 9.4^{+1.1}_{-0.9} arcsec. The average temperature of the cluster is equal to kT=4.4^{+0.5}_{-0.3} keV, with a temperature and cooling profile indicative of a cooling core. We measure the cluster luminosity L_(0.5-2 keV)=3x10^{44} erg s^{-1} and mass 1.5x10^{14} M_sun."

        "Title": "Proper scaling for triangular aperture in OAM measurement",
        "Abstract": "A standard triangular aperture for measuring the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light by diffraction usually has a fixed and limited radius R. This possesses a crucial issue since for an increasing topological charge m of an OAM beam, the radius r of the beam also increases. Here, we prove experimentally our supposition. We use a dynamic triangular aperture that can be programmed to have different characteristic R to diffract beams of various OAM values. By analysing the diffraction patterns with 2d-correlation, we find a minimum bound for R. For a constant initial waist w in the spatial light modulator and a constant position z of the aperture system, we find that the radius of the aperture is unique for each m value. Interestingly, this R scales according to the literature-reported beam's rms radius. We also show that with larger aperture, a smearing effect can be seen in the diffraction patterns which becomes a setback on discerning fringes for the measurement of the topological charge value and thus of the OAM of light. Employing this limit is required if a precise measurement of the OAM of light is needed."

By a Tannaka reconstruction we associate to C and C-du a monoid M with coordinate ring of matrix coefficients F[M], (which has in general no natural coalgebra structure), as well as a Lie algebra Lie(M). We interprete the monoid M algebraic geometrically as a weak algebraic monoid with Lie algebra Lie(M). The monoid M acts by morphisms of varieties on every object of C, the Lie algebra Lie(M) acts by the differentiated action.   If g is in a natural way a subalgebra of Lie(M), we say that C and C-du are good for integrating g. In this situation we treat: The adjoint action of the unit group of M on Lie(M). The relation between g and M-invariant subspaces. The embedding of F[M] in the dual of the universal enveloping algebra of g. A Peter-and-Weyl-type theorem if the category C is semisimple.

        "Abstract": "Weak scale supersymmetry is often said to be fine-tuned, especially if the matter content is minimal. This is not true if there is a large A term for the top squarks. We present a systematic study on fine-tuning in minimal supersymmetric theories and identify low energy spectra that do not lead to severe fine-tuning. Characteristic features of these spectra are: a large A term for the top squarks, small top squark masses, moderately large tan\\beta, and a small \\mu parameter. There are classes of theories leading to these features, which are discussed. In one class, which allows a complete elimination of fine-tuning, the Higgsinos are the lightest among all the superpartners of the standard model particles, leading to three nearly degenerate neutralino/chargino states. This gives interesting signals at the LHC -- the dilepton invariant mass distribution has a very small endpoint and shows a particular shape determined by the Higgsino nature of the two lightest neutralinos. We demonstrate that these signals are indeed useful in realistic analyses by performing Monte Carlo simulations, including detector simulations and background estimations. We also present a method that allows the determination of all the relevant superparticle masses without using input from particular models, despite the limited kinematical information due to short cascades. This allows us to test various possible models, which is demonstrated in the case of a model with mixed moduli-anomaly mediation. We also give a simple derivation of special renormalization group properties associated with moduli mediated supersymmetry breaking, which are relevant in a model without fine-tuning."

        "Abstract": "The cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario for a positive tension brane in a 5-D Universe with localized gravity has been studied previously. In the radiation-dominated Universe, it was suggested that there are two solutions for the cosmic scale factor a(t) : the standard solution $a\\sim t^{1/2}$, and a solution $a\\sim t^{1/4}$, which is incompatible with standard big bang nucleosynthesis. In this note, we reconsider expansion of the Universe in this scenario. We derive and solve a first order, linear differential equation for H^2, the square of the expansion rate of the Universe, as a function of a. The differences between our equation for H^2 and the relationship found in standard cosmology are (i) there is a term proportional to density squared (a fact already known), which is small when the density is small compared to the brane tension, and (ii) there is a contribution which acts like a relativistic fluid. We show that this second contribution is due to gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk. Thus, we find that there need not be any conflict between cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario and the standard model of cosmology. We discuss how reheating at the end of inflation leads to the correct relationship between matter density and expansion rate, $H^2\\to 8\\pi G\\rho_m/3$, and the conditions that must be met for the expansion rate of the Universe to be close to its standard model value around the epoch of cosmological nucleosynthesis."

We prove the unital property of the adjoint module and the commutativity of tensor products, up to module isomorphism. We relate this tensor product construction with Frenkel and Zhu's $A(M)$-theory. We give a proof of a formula of Frenkel and Zhu for fusion rules. We also give the analogue of the ``Hom''-functor of classical Lie algebra theory for vertex operator algebra theory by introducing a notion of ``generalized intertwining operator.'' We prove that the space of generalized intertwining operators from one module to another for a vertex operator algebra is a generalized module. From this result we derive a general form of Tsuchiya and Kanie's ``nuclear democracy theorem'' for any rational vertex operator algebra. This proves that the fusion rules obtained from our construction of tensor products are the same as the fusion rules obtained by using Tsuchiya and Kanie's method, for both WZW models and minimal models. We prove that if $V$ satisfies certain ``finiteness'' and ``semisimplicity'' conditions, then there exists a unique maximal submodule inside the generalized module. Furthermore, we prove that this maximal submodule is isomorphic to the contragredient module of a certain tensor product module. This gives another construction of tensor product modules and this result turns out to be closely related to Huang and Lepowsky's construction."

The estimated temperature of the cluster is kT = 2.45 keV and the central electron density is no~7.8 x 10^(-3) cm^(-3) which reveals a hot, dense environment in which Hercules A is situated. From the combined study of the radio and X-ray data we have estimated a central value of 3<Bo (muG)<9.

A faint but compact radio source, coincident with the optical centre of Hercules A was detected by the EVN at 18 mas resolution. The total flux density of the EVN core is 14.6 mJy. Its angular size is 18 x 7 mas with a position angle of ~139 degrees. There is also evidence for extended emission in the NW-SE direction, most probably from the eastern pc-scale jet.

The random site potential is assumed to be long-range-correlated with a power-law spectral density $S(k) \\sim 1/k^{\\alpha}$, $\\alpha > 0$. This type of correlations results in a phase of extended states at the band center, provided $\\alpha$ is larger than a critical value $\\alpha_c$ [F. A. B. F. de Moura and M. L. Lyra, Phys. Rev.

By fitting a 6' (~360 h_50^-1 kpc) region with a single Mewe-Kaastra-Liedahl model with photoelectric absorption, we find a temperature of 2.1 - 2.3 keV, and abundance of 0.45 - 0.77 (both 90% confidence). We find the addition of a power-law component provides a statistically significant improvement (F-test = 90%) to the fit. The addition of a second thermal component also improves the fit but we argue that it is physically implausible. The power-law component has a photon index (Gamma_X) of 0.4 - 2.8 and a nonthermal flux of (4.1 - 56.7) x 10-5 photons cm^-2 s^-1 over the 1.5 - 10.5 keV range in the Medium Energy Concentrator spectrometer detector. An unidentified X-ray source found in the ROSAT High Resolution Imager observation (~0'.9 from the center of the cluster) is a possible explanation for the nonthermal flux; however, additional evidence of diffuse, nonthermal emission comes from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey radio measurements, in which excess diffuse, radio flux is observed after point-source subtraction. The radio excess can be fitted to a simple power law with a spectral index of ~1.8, which is consistent with the nonthermal X-ray emission spectral index. The steep spectrum is typical of diffuse emission and the size of the radio source implies that it is larger than the cD galaxy and not due to a discreet source."

We find that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion stabilizes a regime of charged meron-antimeron vortex soliton pairs over a region of doping from 0.05 to 0.4 holes per site for intermediate coupling 3 < U/t <8. This stabilization is mediated through the generation of ``spin-flux'' in the mean-field antiferromagnetic (AFM) background. Holes cloaked by a meron-vortex in the spin-flux AFM background are charged bosons. Our static Hartree-Fock calculations provide an upper bound on the energy of a finite density of charged vortices. This upper bound is lower than the energy of the corresponding charged stripe configurations. A finite density of charge carrying vortices is shown to produce a large number of unoccupied electronic levels in the Mott-Hubbard charge transfer gap. These levels lead to significant band tailing and a broad mid-infrared band in the optical absorption spectrum as observed experimentally. At very low doping (below 0.05) the doping charges create extremely tightly bound meron-antimeron pairs or even isolated conventional spin-polarons, whereas for very high doping (above 0.4) the spin background itself becomes unstable to formation of a conventional Fermi liquid and the spin-flux mean-field is energetically unfavorable. Our results point to the predominance of a quantum liquid of charged, bosonic, vortex solitons at intermediate coupling and intermediate doping concentrations."

We find that Q0056-363 is a powerful X-ray quasar, with a 0.3-12 keV unabsorbed luminosity of about 1.2 x 10^45 erg s-1 with the largest part (~67%) emitted below 2 keV. The spectrum reveals a large featureless soft X-ray excess below 2 keV and a strong broad FeKalpha line at 6.4 keV (in the quasar frame). The FeK alpha line is due to low to moderate ionization states of iron (i.e., < Fe XVII), with an equivalent width of about 250 eV and a velocity width of about 25,000 km s-1. Q0056-363 is presently the most luminous AGN known to exhibit such a broad and intense FeKalpha line profile from near neutral iron. The line can be fitted with a relativistic profile from an accretion disc around either a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) or a Kerr (rotating) black hole. A combination of two thermal Comptonization components and a disc reflection model is favored to explain both the continuum over the energy range 0.3-12 keV and the FeK alpha line. A patchy corona covering a large part of the inner disc surface is needed in order to be compatible with the accretion rate inferred from the spectral energy distribution of Q0056-363, unless the mass of the black hole is much higher than about 5 x 10^8 M_odot."

We use a Newtonian 3D SPH code, and model the NS with a stiff (index G=3 and G=2.5) polytropic equation of state and the black hole as a Newtonian point mass. Our initial conditions correspond to irrotational binaries in equilibrium (approximating the NS as a compressible ellipsoid), and we have explored configurations with different initial mass ratios, 0.2< q=M_ns/M_bh<0.5. The dynamical evolution is followed for ~23ms. We include gravitational radiation losses in the quadrupole approximation for a point-mass binary. For G=3, after an initial episode of mass transfer, the NS is not completely disrupted and a remnant core remains in orbit about the black hole. For G=2.5 the disruption is more complex, with the NS being totally disrupted during a second periastron passage. The accretion disc formed around the black hole contains ~0.2 solar masses. A nearly baryon-free axis is always present in the system, and only modest beaming of a relativistic fireball that could give rise to a GRB would be sufficient to avoid baryon contamination. Around 0.01 solar masses may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could contribute substantially to the amount of observed galactic r-process material. We calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms in the quadrupole approximation. We also present the results of simulations that have used spherical NSs relaxed in isolation as initial conditions, in order to gauge the effect of using non-equilibrium initial conditions on the coalescence."

The model is fixed solely by the variance of kappa, which in turn is fixed by the amplitude of the power spectrum, sigma_8. We test the PDF against a high resolution Tree-Particle-Mesh simulation and find that it is far superior to the Gaussian or the lognormal, especially for small values of theta << 1 arcmin and at large values of kappa relevant to strong lensing. With this model, we predict the probabilities of strong lensing by a single plane or by multiple planes. We find that for theta ~ 10 arcsec, a single plane accounts for almost all (~ 98%) of the strong lensing cases for source redshift unity. However, for a more typical source redshift of 4, about 12% of the strong lensing cases will result from the contribution of a secondary clump of matter along the line of sight, introducing a systematic error in the determination of the surface density of clusters, typically overestimating it by about 2-5%. We also find that matter inhomogenieties introduce a dispersion in the value of the angular diameter distance about its cosmological mean. The probable error relative to the mean increases with redshift to a value of about 8% for z ~ 6 and theta ~ 10 arcsec."

We will attempt to develop a heuristic model of the electromagnetic nature of the electron, so that the influence of the gravitational field on the electrodynamics at very large distances leads to a reformulation of our comprehension of the space- time structure at quantum level through the elimination of the classical idea of rest. This will lead us to a modification of the relativistic theory by introducing the idea about a universal minimum limit of speed in the space- time. Such a limit, unattainable by the particles, represents a preferred frame associated with a universal background field (a vacuum energy), enabling a fundamental understanding of the quantum uncertainties. The structure of space-time becomes extended due to such a vacuum energy density, which leads to a negative pressure at the cosmological scales as an anti-gravity, playing the role of the cosmological constant. The tiny values of the vacuum energy density and the cosmological constant will be successfully obtained, being in agreement with current observational results."

Our new images reveal dramatic shell structure indicative of a merger event in the relatively recent past. The brightest shells in the central regions of the host are distributed alternately in radius, with at least two distinct shells on one side of the nucleus and three on the other, out to a distance of ~13 kpc. The light within the five shells comprises ~6% of the total galaxy light. Lower surface brightness ripples or tails and other debris extend out to a distance of ~65 kpc. A simple N-body model for a merger reproduces the inner shell structure and gives an estimate for the age of the merger between ~30 Myr and ~1.7 Gyr, depending on a range of reasonable assumptions. While the inner shell structure is suggestive of a minor merger, the total light contribution from the shells and extended structures are more indicative of a major merger. The spectrum of the host galaxy is dominated by a population of intermediate age (~1.4 Gyr), indicating a strong starburst episode that may have occurred at the time of the merger event. We speculate that the current QSO activity may have been triggered in the recent past by either a minor merger, or by debris from an older (~Gyr) major merger that is currently ``raining'' back into the central regions of the merger remnant."

In both cases, the object is treated as a global entity, and a single pose estimate is computed. As a consequence, the resulting techniques can be vulnerable to large occlusions.   In this paper, we introduce a segmentation-driven 6D pose estimation framework where each visible part of the objects contributes a local pose prediction in the form of 2D keypoint locations. We then use a predicted measure of confidence to combine these pose candidates into a robust set of 3D-to-2D correspondences, from which a reliable pose estimate can be obtained. We outperform the state-of-the-art on the challenging Occluded-LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets, which is evidence that our approach deals well with multiple poorly-textured objects occluding each other. Furthermore, it relies on a simple enough architecture to achieve real-time performance."

These observations together cover a broad energy range ~0.7--50 keV with a moderate energy resolution at the iron K-band, thus make it possible to disentangle various spectral components. The low-energy spectrum is dominated by an ultra-soft component, which is likely to be the emission from the hottest inner portion of the accretion disk around the black hole. At high energies, the X-ray spectrum can be described by a Comptonized spectrum with a reflection component. The Compton corona, which upscatters soft ``seed photons'' to produce the hard X-ray emission, is found to have a y-parameter ~0.28. The hard X-ray emission illuminates the accretion disk and the re-emitted photons produce the observed ``reflection bump''. We show that the reflecting medium subtends only a small solid angle ($\\sim 0.15\\times 2\\pi$), but has a large ionization parameter such that iron is ionized up to \\ion{Fe}{24}-\\ion{Fe}{26}. The presence of a broad iron line at $6.58\\pm0.04$ keV is also consistent with a highly ionized disk, if we take into account the gravitational and Doppler shift of the line energy. These results imply a geometry with a central corona surrounding the black hole and the reflection occurring in the innermost region of the disk where matter is highly ionized."

        "Title": "Symplectic foliations and generalized complex structures",
        "Abstract": "We answer the natural question: when are a regular Poisson structure along with a complex structure transverse to its symplectic leaves induced by generalized complex structure? The leafwise symplectic form and transverse complex structure determine an obstruction class in a certain cohomology, which vanishes if and only if our question has an affirmative answer. We first study a component of this obstruction, which gives the condition that the leafwise cohomology class of the symplectic form must be transversely pluriharmonic. As a consequence, under certain topological hypotheses, we infer that we actually have a symplectic fibre bundle over a complex base. We then show how to compute the full obstruction via a spectral sequence. We give various concrete necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the obstruction. Throughout, we give examples to test the sharpness of these conditions, including a symplectic fibre bundle over a complex base which does not come from a generalized complex structure, and a regular generalized complex structure which is very unlike a symplectic fibre bundle, i.e., for which nearby leaves are not symplectomorphic."

        "Title": "Information Flow in Computational Systems",
        "Abstract": "We develop a theoretical framework for defining and identifying flows of information in computational systems. Here, a computational system is assumed to be a directed graph, with \"clocked\" nodes that send transmissions to each other along the edges of the graph at discrete points in time. A few measures of information flow have been proposed previously in the literature, and measures of directed causal influence are currently being used as a heuristic proxy for information flow. However, there is as yet no rigorous treatment of the problem with formal definitions and clearly stated assumptions, and the process of defining information flow is often conflated with the problem of estimating it. In this work, we provide a new information-theoretic definition for information flow in a computational system, which we motivate using a series of examples. We then show that this definition satisfies intuitively desirable properties, including the existence of \"information paths\", along which information flows from the input of the computational system to its output. Finally, we describe how information flow might be estimated in a noiseless setting, and provide an algorithm to identify information paths on the time-unrolled graph of a computational system."

        "Abstract": "We report a comprehensive micro-Raman study of a pressurized suspended graphene membrane that hermetically seals a circular pit, etched in a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate. Placing the sample under a uniform pressure load results in bulging of the graphene membrane and subsequent softening of the main Raman features, due to tensile strain. In such a microcavity, the intensity of the Raman features depends very sensitively on the distance between the graphene membrane and the Si substrate, which acts as the bottom mirror of the cavity. Thus, a spatially resolved analysis of the intensity of the G- and 2D-mode features as a function of the pressure load permits a direct reconstruction of the blister profile. An average strain is then deduced at each pressure load, and Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameters of $1.8\\pm0.2$ and $2.4\\pm0.2$ are determined for the Raman G and 2D modes, respectively. In addition, the measured blister height is proportional to the cubic root of the pressure load, as predicted theoretically. The validation of this scaling provides a direct and accurate determination the Young's modulus of graphene with a purely optical, hence contactless and minimally invasive, approach. We find a Young's modulus of $(1.05\\pm 0.10) \\rm TPa$ for monolayer graphene, in a perfect match with previous nanoindentation measurements. This all-optical methodology opens avenues for pressure sensing using graphene and could readily be adapted to other emerging two-dimensional materials and nanoresonators."

From these observations, zeta^2 CrB was found to be a triple system and a new spectroscopic orbit was calculated. This orbit has two periods, a 1.72357 day period for the inner binary composed of zeta^2 CrB A & B and a 251 day period for the outer binary composed of zeta^2 CrB AB & C. The inner binary is a double-lined spectroscopic binary composed of two B7 V stars. The inner binary's center of mass (zeta^2 CrB AB) describes a long-period single-lined variation identified with the outer binary. The inner binary period is significantly shorter than the 12.5842 day period previously calculated by Abhyankar & Sarma (1966). The inner binary possesses an essentially circular orbit (e = 0.01) while the outer binary has an eccentric orbit (e = 0.48). From the widths of their Si II 6371 A lines, the vsini's were calculated to be 46 +/- 7 km s^-1 for zeta^2 CrB A and 7.5 +/- 2 km s^-1 for zeta^2 CrB B. As zeta^2 CrB A & B have similar masses, their different rotational velocities make this system a sensitive test of synchronization theories."

When presented with a document, each classifier estimates the probability for the document to be relevant to the topic for which it has been trained. Since the procedure for building a filter is topic-independent, the system is fully automatic.   By making use of a sample of documents that have previously been evaluated as relevant or not relevant to a particular topic, a term selection is performed, and a neural network is trained. Each document is represented by a vector of frequencies of a list of selected terms. This list depends on the topic to be filtered; it is constructed in two steps. The first step defines the characteristic words used in the relevant documents of the corpus; the second one chooses, among the previous list, the most discriminant ones. The length of the vector is optimized automatically for each topic. At the end of the term selection, a vector of typically 25 words is defined for the topic, so that each document which has to be processed is represented by a vector of term frequencies.   This vector is subsequently input to a classifier that is trained from the same sample. After training, the classifier estimates for each document of a test set its probability of being relevant; for submission to TREC, the top 1000 documents are ranked in order of decreasing relevance."

As straightforward consequences of these constructions, when g=3 and k is a subfield of the complex field, we obtain (i) a new proof of a formula of Klein linking the modular form \\chi_{18} to the square of the discriminant of plane quartics ; (ii) a proof that one can decide when (A,a) is a Jacobian over k by looking whether the value of \\chi_{18} at (A,a) is a square in k.

        "Abstract": "We consider a lattice equation (Salerno model) combining onsite self-focusing and intersite self-defocusing cubic terms, which may describe a Bose-Einstein condensate of dipolar atoms trapped in a strong periodic potential. In the continuum approximation, the model gives rise to solitons in a finite band of frequencies, with sechlike solitons near one edge, and an exact peakon solution at the other. A similar family of solitons is found in the discrete system, including a peakon; beyond the peakon, the family continues in the form of cuspons. Stability of the lattice solitons is explored through computation of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and by direct simulations. A small part of the family is unstable (in that case, the discrete solitons transform into robust pulsonic excitations); both peakons and cuspons are stable. The Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion precisely explains the stability of regular solitons and peakons, but does not apply to cuspons. In-phase and out-of-phase bound states of solitons are also constructed. They exchange their stability at a point where the bound solitons are peakons. Mobile solitons, composed of a moving core and background, exist up to a critical value of the strength of the self-defocusing intersite nonlinearity. Colliding solitons always merge into a single pulse."

We show that the resolvent of $H$ admits a meromorphic extension from the upper half-plane to an appropriate complex manifold ${\\mathcal M}$, and define the resonances of $H$ as the poles of this meromorphic extension. We study their distribution near any fixed Landau level $2bq$, $q \\in {\\mathbb N}$. First, we obtain a sharp upper bound of the number of resonances in a vicinity of $2bq$. Moreover, under appropriate hypotheses, we establish corresponding lower bounds which imply the existence of an infinite number of resonances, or the absence of resonances in certain sectors adjoining $2bq$. Finally, we deduce a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function (SSF) for the operator pair $(H,H_0)$ as a sum of a harmonic measure related to the resonances, and the imaginary part of a holomorphic function. This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner approximation, implies a trace formula, and provides information on the singularities of the SSF at the Landau levels."

The periodic driving, we employ here, is adiabatically switched on to break the particle-hole symmetry and generate a chiral mass term in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian; consequently the Floquet Hamiltonian also gets deformed without crossing the gapless critical point. The particle hole symmetry is subsequently restored in the Floquet Hamiltonian by adiabatically switching off a part of the periodic potential. Thereafter, the Floquet Hamiltonian develops a symmetry protected non-trivial topological winding number. Furthermore, we also observe stroboscopic topologically protected localised edge states in a long open chain and show that a bulk boundary correspondence survives a unitary non-equilibrium situation in 1D BDI Hamiltonians."

We propose constrained GSRP, a novel framework that minimizes the reconstruction error for inputs in a subspace, subject to a constraint on the maximum regret-error for any other signal in the entire signal space. This framework addresses the primary limitation of existing GSRPs (consistent, subspace and minimax regret), namely, the assumption that the a priori subspace is either fully known or fully ignored. We formulate constrained GSRP as a constrained optimization problem, the solution to which turns out to be a convex combination of the subspace and the minimax regret samplings. Detailed theoretical analysis on the reconstruction error shows that constrained sampling achieves a reconstruction that is 1) (sub)optimal for signals in the input subspace, 2) robust for signals around the input subspace, and 3) reasonably bounded for any other signals with a simple choice of the constraint parameter. Experimental results on sampling-reconstruction of a Gaussian input and a speech signal demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

The subject of this research is to identify a list of parametrisations (formula-size, treewidth, treedepth, team-size, number of variables) under which MC becomes fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, we show that the number of disjunctions or the arity of dependence atoms (dep-arity) as a parameter both yield a paraNP-completeness result. Then, we consider the satisfiability problem (SAT) showing a different picture: under team-size, or dep-arity SAT is paraNP-complete whereas under all other mentioned parameters the problem is in FPT. Finally, we introduce a variant of the satisfiability problem, asking for teams of a given size, and show for this problem an almost complete picture."

The source was resolved by the Very Large Array into two components with a separation of ~0.7 arcsec and characteristic sizes of ~0.2 arcsec. The two components of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1 +/- 0.1. We detect an upper limit to the proper motion of the Eastern component of ~3 x 10^3 km s^-1 relative to Sgr A*. We detect a proper motion of ~10^4 km s^-1 for the Western component relative to Sgr A*. The transient was also detected at X-ray wavelengths with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton telescope and given the designation CXOGC J174540.0-290031. The X-ray source falls in between the two radio components. The maximum luminosity of the X-ray source is ~10^36 erg s^-1, significantly sub-Eddington. The radio jet flux density predicted by the X-ray/radio correlation for X-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less than the measured flux density. We conclude that the radio transient is the result of a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the X-ray source and interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the Galactic Center."

Deep optical and near-IR imaging reveal a red galaxy overdensity around the peak of the X-ray emission, with a significant excess of objects with J-K and I-K colors typical of elliptical galaxies at z ~ 1.0. Spectroscopic observations at the Keck II telescope secured 9 galaxy redshifts in the range 1.095<z<1.120 yielding a mean cluster redshift of <z>=1.106. Eight of these galaxies lie within a 30 arcsec radius around the peak X-ray emission. A deep Chandra ACIS exposure on this field shows extended X-ray morphology and allows the X-ray spectrum of the intracluster medium to be measured. The cluster has a bolometric luminosity L_x = 2.48^{+0.33}_{-0.26} x 10^44 ergs/s, a temperature of kT = 7.2^{+2.2}_{-1.4} keV, and a mass within r = 1 Mpc of 7.0 x 10^14 M_sun (H_0=65 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, and Lambda = 0.7). The spatial distribution of the cluster members is elongated, which is not due to an observational selection effect, and followed by the X-ray morphology.

We find that the quantum effects lead to a growth of both the event horizon and the ergosphere, as well as to a reduction of the angular velocity compared to their corresponding unperturbed values. Quantum corrections also give rise to the formation of a curvature singularity at the Cauchy horizon and show no evidence of the appearance of a superradiant instability. In the naked singularity case, quantum effects lead to the formation of a horizon that hides the conical defect, thus turning it into a black hole. The fact that these effects occur not only for static but also for spinning geometries makes a strong case for the r\\^ole of quantum mechanics as a cosmic censor in Nature."

Two main regimes have been discussed, {\\it hydromagnetic outflows}, which have a significant mass flux and have energy and angular momentum carried by both the matter and the electromagnetic field and, Poynting outflows, where the mass flux is negligible and energy and angular momentum are carried predominantly by the electromagnetic field. Here we consider a Keplerian disk initially threaded by a dipole-like magnetic field and we present solutions of the force-free Grad-Shafranov equation for the coronal plasma. We find solutions with Poynting jets where there is a continuous outflow of energy and toroidal magnetic flux from the disk into the external space. This behavior contradicts the commonly accepted ``theorem'' of Solar plasma physics that the motion of the footpoints of a magnetic loop structure leads to a stationary magnetic field configuration with zero power and flux outflows.   In addition we discuss recent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which establish that quasi-stationary collimated Poynting jets similar to our Grad-Shafranov solutions arise from the inner part of a disk threaded by a dipole-like magnetic field. At the same time we find that there is a steady uncollimated hydromagnetic outflow from the outer part of the disk. The Poynting jets represent a likely model for the jets from active galactic nuclei, microquasars, and gamma ray burst sources."

Given a black-box classifier, we aim to eliminate the performance gap by perturbing the distribution of input variables for the disadvantaged group. We refer to the perturbed distribution as a counterfactual distribution, and characterize its properties for common fairness criteria. We introduce a descent algorithm to learn a counterfactual distribution from data. We then discuss how the estimated distribution can be used to build a data preprocessor that can reduce disparate impact without training a new model. We validate our approach through experiments on real-world datasets, showing that it can repair different forms of disparity without a significant drop in accuracy."

If a quartic self-interaction term for the scalar field is considered, there is a solution describing an asymptotically locally AdS charged black hole dressed with a scalar field that is regular on and outside the event horizon, which is a surface of negative constant curvature. This black hole can have negative mass, which is bounded from below for the extremal case, and its causal structure shows that the solution describes a \"black hole inside a black hole\". The thermodynamics of the non-extremal black hole is analyzed in the grand canonical ensemble. The entropy does not follow the area, and there is an effective Newton constant which depends on the value of the scalar field at the horizon. If the base manifold is locally flat, the solution has no electric charge, and the scalar field has a vanishing stress-energy tensor so that it dresses a locally AdS spacetime with a nut at the origin. In the case of vanishing selfinteraction, the solutions also dress locally AdS spacetimes, and if the base manifold is of negative constant curvature a massless electrically charged hairy black hole is obtained. The thermodynamics of this black hole is also analyzed. It is found that the bounds for the black holes parameters in the conformal frame obtained from requiring the entropy to be positive are mapped into the ones that guarantee cosmic censorship in the Einstein frame."

We show that the morphological, spectral and photometric properties of the arcs are consistent with them arising from the lensing of a single ~L* LBG. The most important feature of this system is that the lensing magnification results in an apparent magnitude of r=20.3, making this one of the brightest LBGs known. Such a high magnification provides the opportunity of obtaining very high signal to noise (and potentially spatially resolved) spectroscopy of a high redshift galaxy to study its physical properties. We present initial imaging and spectroscopy demonstrating the basic properties of the system and discuss the opportunities for future observations."

        "Title": "Natural Energy Bounds in Quantum Thermodynamics",
        "Abstract": "Given a stationary state for a noncommutative flow, we study a boundedness condition, depending on a positive parameter beta, which is weaker than the KMS equilibrium condition at inverse temperature beta. This condition is equivalent to a holomorphic property closely related to the one recently considered by Ruelle and D'Antoni-Zsido and shared by a natural class of non-equilibrium steady states. Our holomorphic property is stronger than the Ruelle's one and thus selects a restricted class of non-equilibrium steady states. We also introduce the complete boundedness condition and show this notion to be equivalent to the Pusz-Woronowicz complete passivity property, hence to the KMS condition.   In Quantum Field Theory, the beta-boundedness condition can be interpreted as the property that localized state vectors have energy density levels increasing beta-subexponentially, a property which is similar in the form and weaker in the spirit than the modular compactness-nuclearity condition. In particular, for a Poincare' covariant net of C*-algebras on the Minkowski spacetime, the beta-boundedness property, for beta greater equal than 2 pi, for the boosts is shown to be equivalent to the Bisognano-Wichmann property. The Hawking temperature is thus minimal for a thermodynamical system in the background of a Rindler black hole within the class of beta-holomorphic states. More generally, concerning the Killing evolution associated with a class of stationary quantum black holes, we characterize KMS thermal equilibrium states at Hawking temperature in terms of the boundedness property and the existence of a translation symmetry on the horizon."

        "Abstract": "Very little attention has been paid to the properties of optical wavefronts and caustic surfaces due to gravitational lensing. Yet the wavefront-based point of view is natural and provides insights into the nature of the caustic surfaces on a gravitationally lensed lightcone. We derive analytically the basic equations governing the wavefronts, lightcones, caustics on wavefronts, and caustic surfaces on lightcones in the context of weak-field, thin-screen gravitational lensing. These equations are all related to the potential of the lens. In the process, we also show that the standard single-plane gravitational lensing map extends to a new mapping, which we call a wavefront lensing map. Unlike the standard lensing map, the Jacobian matrix of a wavefront lensing map is not symmetric. Our formulas are then applied to caustic ``surfing.'' By surfing a caustic surface, a space-borne telescope can be fixed on a gravitationally lensed source to obtain an observation of the source at very high magnification over an extended time period, revealing structure about the source that could not otherwise be resolved. Using our analytical expressions for caustic sheets, we present a scheme for surfing a caustic sheet of a lensed source in rectilinear motion. Detailed illustrations are also presented of the possible types of wavefronts and caustic sheets due to nonsingular and singular elliptical potentials, and singular isothermal spheres, including an example of caustic surfing for a singular elliptical potential lens."

        "Abstract": "Context. The circumstellar disks ejected by many rapidly rotating B stars (so-called Be stars) offer the rare opportunity of studying the structure and dynamics of gaseous disks at high spectral as well as angular resolution. Aims. This paper explores a newly identified effect in spectro-interferometric phase that can be used for probing the inner regions of gaseous edge-on disks on a scale of a few stellar radii. Methods. The origin of this effect (dubbed central quasi-emission phase signature, CQE-PS) lies in the velocity-dependent line absorption of photospheric radiation by the circumstellar disk. At high spectral and marginal interferometric resolution, photocenter displacements between star and isovelocity regions in the Keplerian disk reveal themselves through small interferometric phase shifts. To investigate the diagnostic potential of this effect, a series of models are presented, based on detailed radiative transfer calculations in a viscous decretion disk. Results. Amplitude and detailed shape of the CQE-PS depend sensitively on disk density and size and on the radial distribution of the material with characteristic shapes in differential phase diagrams. In addition, useful lower limits to the angular size of the central stars can be derived even when the system is almost unresolved. Conclusions. The full power of this diagnostic tool can be expected if it can be applied to observations over a full life-cycle of a disk from first ejection through final dispersal, over a full cycle of disk oscillations, or over a full orbital period in a binary system."

        "Abstract": "In this paper we investigate some properties, including causality, of a particular class of relativistic dissipative fluid theories of divergence type. This set is defined as those theories coming from a statistical description of matter, in the sense that the three tensor fields appearing in the theory can be expressed as the three first momenta of a suitable distribution function. In this set of theories the causality condition for the resulting system of hyperbolic partial differential equations is very simple and allow to identify a subclass of manifestly causal theories, which are so for all states outside equilibrium for which the theory preserves this statistical interpretation condition. This subclass includes the usual equilibrium distributions, namely Boltzmann, Bose or Fermi distributions, according to the statistics used, suitably generalized outside equilibrium. Therefore this gives a simple proof that they are causal in a neighborhood of equilibrium. We also find a bigger set of dissipative divergence type theories which are only pseudo-statistical, in the sense that the third rank tensor of the fluid theory has the symmetry and trace properties of a third momentum of an statistical distribution, but the energy-momentum tensor, while having the form of a second momentum distribution, it is so for a different distribution function. This set also contains a subclass (including the one already mentioned) of manifestly causal theories."

        "Abstract": "Absorption and reprocessing of Gamma-ray burst radiation in the environment of cosmological GRBs can be used as a powerful probe of the elusive nature of their progenitors. Although it is widely accepted that long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, at least two fundamentally different scenarios concerning the final collapse are currently being considered. Delayed reddened excesses in the optical afterglows of several GRBs indicate that a supernova, possibly of Type Ic, takes place within a few days of a GRB. This supports the collapsar model, where the core of a massive star collapses promptly to a black hole. Variable X-ray features observed in the prompt and afterglow spectra of several GRBs, suggest that a highly metal enriched and dense shell of material surrounds the sources of GRBs. In some cases, evidence for expansion of these shells with velocities of a substantial fraction of the speed of light has been claimed. These observations have been interpreted as support for the supranova model, where a massive star collapses first to a supramassive neutron star, which later collapses to a black hole following loss of rotational support. In this review paper, I will present a brief overview of the current status of the observational evidence for X-ray spectral features in GRBs, and discuss their implications for both the collapsar and the supranova model."

X-ray studies of the GRB afterglows can deepen our knowledge of the ionization status and metal abundances of the matter in the GRB environment. Moreover, the presence of local matter can be inferred through its fingerprints in the X-ray spectrum, i.e. the presence of absorption higher than the Galactic value. A few studies based on BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton found evidence of higher than Galactic values for the column density in a number of GRB afterglows. Here we report on a systematic analysis of 17 GRBs observed by Swift up to April 15, 2005. We observed a large number of GRBs with an excess of column density. Our sample, together with previous determinations of the intrinsic column densities for GRBs with known redshift, provides evidence for a distribution of absorption consistent with that predicted for randomly occurring GRB within molecular clouds."

In particular, we show that blow-up in these models can always be prevented if the added drift has a small enough dissipation time. We also prove a general result relating the dissipation time and the effective diffusivity of stationary cellular flows, which allows us to obtain examples of simple incompressible flows with arbitrarily small dissipation times.   As an application, we show that blow-up in the Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis can always be prevented if the velocity field of the ambient fluid has a sufficiently small dissipation time. We prove a similar result for a fluid dynamics model derived from the 3D Navier-Stokes equations by adding a convection term to their vorticity formulation. Finally we study reaction-diffusion equations with ignition-type nonlinearities, and show that the reaction can always be quenched by the addition of a convective term with a small enough dissipation time, provided the average initial temperature is initially below the ignition threshold."

When presented with a document, each classifier estimates the probability for the document to be relevant to the topic for which it has been trained. Since the procedure for building a filter is topic-independent, the system is fully automatic.   By making use of a sample of documents that have previously been evaluated as relevant or not relevant to a particular topic, a term selection is performed, and a neural network is trained. Each document is represented by a vector of frequencies of a list of selected terms. This list depends on the topic to be filtered; it is constructed in two steps. The first step defines the characteristic words used in the relevant documents of the corpus; the second one chooses, among the previous list, the most discriminant ones. The length of the vector is optimized automatically for each topic. At the end of the term selection, a vector of typically 25 words is defined for the topic, so that each document which has to be processed is represented by a vector of term frequencies.   This vector is subsequently input to a classifier that is trained from the same sample. After training, the classifier estimates for each document of a test set its probability of being relevant; for submission to TREC, the top 1000 documents are ranked in order of decreasing relevance."

We adopt a simple phenomenological description of the anisotropy, in which the most energetic electrons have a small pitch angle and the least energetic electrons are isotropic, as proposed by Sobacchi \\& Lyubarsky (2019). We explore (i) a simple model that assumes a phenomenological shape for the electron energy distribution, and (ii) a self-consistent scheme in which the electrons follow a distribution which is the result of the balance between injection and radiative losses (we include the effects of the anisotropy on the synchrotron cooling rate). Considering the BL Lac object Mkn 421 as representative of the entire class, we show that in both cases the emission can be satisfactorily reproduced under equipartition between the magnetic field and the relativistic electrons. This is in better agreement with the idea that jets are launched as Poynting dominated flows with respect to the standard isotropic scenario, which requires both a low magnetization and a low radiative efficiency to reproduce the observed emission. The hard spectrum predicted for the inverse Compton continuum at TeV energies could be used as a potential test of the anisotropic model."

For in many scenarios it is not feasible to use money to compensate agents for otherwise unsatisfactory outcomes. This paper studies this question, looking at both fairness and efficiency measures.   We employ the proportionally fair solution, which is a well-known fairness concept for money-free settings. But although finding a proportionally fair solution is computationally tractable, it cannot be implemented in a truthful fashion. Consequently, we seek approximate solutions. We give several truthful mechanisms which achieve proportional fairness in an approximate sense. We use a strong notion of approximation, requiring the mechanism to give each agent a good approximation of its proportionally fair utility. In particular, one of our mechanisms provides a better and better approximation factor as the minimum demand for every good increases. A motivating example is provided by the massive privatization auction in the Czech republic in the early 90s.   With regard to efficiency, prior work has shown a lower bound of 0.5 on the approximation factor of any swap-dictatorial mechanism approximating a social welfare measure even for the two agents and multiple goods case. We surpass this lower bound by designing a non-swap-dictatorial mechanism for this case. Interestingly, the new mechanism builds on the notion of proportional fairness."

Whenever $p$ differs from the golden ratio, asymptotically as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$, the winner of the game is determined. In the case where $p$ equals the golden ratio, we call such a random game a \\emph{golden game}. In golden games the winner is the player that acts first with probability that is equal to the golden ratio. We suggest the notion of \\emph{fragility} as a measure for \"fairness\" of a game's rules. Fragility counts how many leaves' payoffs should be flipped in order to convert the identity of the winning player. Our main result provides a recursive formula for asymptotic fragility of golden games. Surprisingly, golden games are extremely fragile. For instance, with probability $\\approx 0.77$ a losing player could flip a single payoff (out of $2^n$) and become a winner. With probability $\\approx 0.999$ a losing player could flip 3 payoffs and become the winner."

        "Abstract": "In case of spacetimes with single horizon, there exist several well-established procedures for relating the surface gravity of the horizon to a thermodynamic temperature. Such procedures, however, cannot be extended in a straightforward manner when a spacetime has multiple horizons. In particular, it is not clear whether there exists a notion of global temperature characterizing the multi-horizon spacetimes. We examine the conditions under which a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using the example of Schwarzschild-De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically extend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor, response of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for identifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the SDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart which covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a consistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS spacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two temperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS spacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational (c) Even when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal nature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate chart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other charts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures. The coordinate dependence of the thermal nature is reminiscent of the flat spacetime in Minkowski and Rindler coordinate charts. The implications are discussed."

This minimal B-L MSSM can have a colored/charged LSP, of which a stop LSP is the most amenable to observation at the LHC. We study the R-parity violating decays of a stop LSP into a bottom quark and charged leptons--the dominant modes for a generic \"admixture\" stop. A numerical analysis of the relative branching ratios of these decay channels is given using a wide scan over the parameter space. The fact that R-parity is violated in this theory by a vacuum expectation value of a sneutrino links these branching ratios directly to the neutrino mass hierarchy. It is shown how a discovery of bottom-charged lepton events at the LHC can potentially determine whether the neutrino masses are in a normal or inverted hierarchy, as well as determining the theta_23 neutrino mixing angle. Finally, present LHC bounds on these leptoquark signatures are used to put lower bounds on the stop mass."

The model risk score is a biomarker of ageing, since it was predictive of lifespan and healthspan (as defined by the onset of specified diseases), and was elevated in groups associated with life-shortening lifestyles, such as smoking. We ascertained the target domain performance in a smaller cohort of the mobile application that included users who were willing to share answers to a short questionnaire related to their disease and smoking status. We thus conclude that the proposed pipeline combining deep convolutional and Domain Adversarial neuron networks (DANN) is a powerful tool for disease risk and lifestyle-associated hazard assessment from mobile motion sensors that are transferable across devices and populations."

The interest in this potential is that in one parametrization it can account for a conformal symmetry of the strong interaction, and in another for its perturbation, a reason for which we here employ it to study status of conformal symmetry in the heavy flavor sector. The resulting predictions on heavy quarkonia mass spectra and root mean square radii are compared with the available experimental data, as well as with predictions by other theoretical approaches. We observe that a relatively small conformal symmetry perturbing term in the potential suffices to achieve good agreement with data."

Such systems have never been tested before for stability, although high anisotropies have been considered in the dynamical models that were used to estimate the masses of the central putative supermassive black holes. A family of analytical anisotropic spherical Hernquist models with and without a black hole were investigated by means of N-body simulations. A clear trend emerges that the supermassive black hole has a significant effect on the overall stability of the system, i.e. an SBH with a mass of a few percent of the total mass of the galaxy can prevent or reduce the bar instabilities in anisotropic systems. Its mass not only determines the strength of the instability reduction, but also the time in which this occurs. These effects are most significant for models with strong radial anisotropies. Furthermore, our analysis shows that unstable systems with similar SBH but with different anisotropy radii evolve differently: highly radial systems become oblate, while more isotropic models tend to form into prolate structures. In addition to this study, we also present a Monte-Carlo algorithm to generate particles in spherical anisotropic systems."

The expressions involve the partial derivatives (with respect to the nuclear coordinates) of the matrix elements of the coupling Hamiltonian. Examples are given of a few studied cases, such as of excited states that have topological angles with a sign opposite to those in the ground states. In the second part, the two dimensional (or two parameter) situation that characterizes a conical intersection (ci) between potential surfaces in a polyatomic molecule is constructed as a limiting case of the three dimensional Dirac-monopole situation. For an electron occupying a twofold state, we obtain both the \"magnetic-field\" (or curl-field) and the tensorial (or Yang-Mills-) field (which is the sum of a curl and of a vector- product term). These pseudo- fields represent the reaction of the electron on the nuclear motion via the nonadiabatic coupling terms (NACTs). We find that both fields are aligned with the orthogonal, (so called) seam directions of the ci and are zero everywhere outside the seam, but they differ as regards the flux that they produce. In a two-state situation, the fields are representation dependent and the values of, e.g., the fluxes depend on the state that the electron occupies. The angular dependence of the NACTs and the fields calculated from a general linearly coupled model agrees with recently computed results for $C_2 H$ [A.M. Mebel, M. Baer and S.H. Lin, J.Chem.

When the replaced material is a viscous fluid, it forms a finger-like pattern, known as viscous fingering. Interestingly, most replaced materials are, in reality, viscoelastic, i.e., they behave as an elastic solid over short timescales but flow as a viscous liquid over longer timescales. Therefore, it is important to study the scenario in which the replaced material is a viscoelastic fluid. In this study, we observe the appearance of delamination-induced fingering when an incompressible organic fluid is injected into an oleophilic Hele--Shaw cell filled with an aqueous viscoelastic fluid composed of a wormlike micellar solution. We find a transition in the injection pattern: during the injection, the thick fingering pattern of the interface near the inlet changes to thin fingers with a characteristic size of four times the cell thickness. We examine the material properties, and conclude that the fingering pattern observed at later times is caused by the delamination of viscoelastic fluid from the substrate."

The burst was apparently associated with the optically (restframe UV) brightest component of a system of at least five galaxies or galaxy fragments at a redshift of z = 1.0969. The component we identify as the host galaxy shows a moderately high unobscured star formation rate, SFR = 5 M_solar/yr, but a high SFR per unit mass, indicative of a starburst. The image components show a broad range of (R-K) colors, with two of them being very red, possibly due to dust. Overall morphology of the system can be naturally interpreted as a strong tidal interaction of two or more galaxies, at a redshift where such events were much more common than now. Given the well established causal link between galaxy mergers and starbursts, we propose that this is a strong case for a GRB originating from a merger-induced starburst system. This supports the proposed link between GRBs and massive star formation."

The key analytical tool is the singular value expansion of the parameterized solution, which we approximate with a singular value decomposition of a parameter snapshot matrix. To evaluate the reduced-order model at a new parameter, we interpolate a subset of the right singular vectors to generate the reduced-order model's coefficients. We employ a novel method to select this subset that uses the parameter gradient of the right singular vectors to split the terms in the expansion yielding a mean prediction and a prediction covariance---similar to a Gaussian process approximation. The covariance serves as a confidence measure for the reduce order model. We demonstrate the efficacy of the reduced-order model using a parameter study of heat transfer in random media. The high-fidelity simulations produce more than 4TB of data; we compute the singular value decomposition and evaluate the reduced-order model using scalable MapReduce/Hadoop implementations. We compare the accuracy of our method with a scalar response surface on a set of temperature profile measurements and find that our model better captures sharp, local features in the parameter space."

The method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice). The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain physically relevant cases are given."

        "Abstract": "The performance of lithium and sodium ion batteries relies notably on the accessibility to carbon electrodes of controllable porous structure and chemical composition. This work reports a facile synthesis of well-defined porous N-doped carbons (NPCs) using a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) as precursor, and graphene oxide (GO)-stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanoparticles as sacrificial template. The GO-stabilized PMMA nanoparticles were first prepared and then decorated by a thin PIL coating before carbonization. The resulting NPCs reached a satisfactory specific surface area of up to 561 m2/g and a hierarchically meso- and macroporous structure while keeping a nitrogen content of 2.6 wt %. Such NPCs delivered a high reversible charge/discharge capacity of 1013 mA h/g over 200 cycles at 0.4 A/g for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), and showed a good capacity of 204 mA h/g over 100 cycles at 0.1 A/g for sodium ion batteries (SIBs)."

        "Title": "Stability of leadership in bottom-up hierarchical organizations",
        "Abstract": "The stability of a leadership against a growing internal opposition is studied in bottom-up hierarchical organizations. Using a very simple model with bottom-up majority rule voting, the dynamics of power distribution at the various hierarchical levels is calculated within a probabilistic framework. Given a leadership at the top, the opposition weight from the hierarchy bottom is shown to fall off quickly while climbing up the hierarchy. It reaches zero after only a few hierarchical levels. Indeed the voting process is found to obey a threshold dynamics with a deterministic top outcome. Accordingly the leadership may stay stable against very large amplitude increases in the opposition at the bottom level. An opposition can thus grow steadily from few percent up to seventy seven percent with not one a single change at the elected top level. However and in contrast, from one election to another, in the vicinity of the threshold, less than a one percent additional shift at the bottom level can drive a drastic and brutal change at the top. The opposition topples the current leadership at once. In addition to analytical formulas, results from a large scale simulation are presented. The results may shed a new light on management architectures as well as on alert systems. They could also provide some different insight on last century's Eastern European communist collapse."

        "Abstract": "A vertex algebra is an algebraic counterpart of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. We give a new definition of a vertex algebra which includes chiral algebras as a special case, but allows for fields which are neither meromorphic nor anti-meromorphic. To any complex torus equipped with a flat Kahler metric and a closed 2-form we associate an N=2 superconformal vertex algebra (N=2 SCVA) in the sense of our definition. We find a criterion for two different tori to produce isomorphic N=2 SCVA's. We show that for algebraic tori isomorphism of N=2 SCVA's implies the equivalence of the derived categories of coherent sheaves corresponding to the tori or their noncommutative generalizations (Azumaya algebras over tori). We also find a criterion for two different tori to produce N=2 SCVA's related by a mirror morphism. If the 2-form is of type (1,1), this condition is identical to the one proposed by Golyshev, Lunts, and Orlov, who used an entirely different approach inspired by the Homological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture of Kontsevich. Our results suggest that Kontsevich's conjecture must be modified: coherent sheaves must be replaced with modules over Azumaya algebras, and the Fukaya category must be ``twisted'' by a closed 2-form. We also describe the implications of our results for BPS D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds."

We study arguably the simplest random structure of payoffs over such games where 0/1 payoffs in the leafs are drawn according to an i.i.d. Bernoulli distribution with probability $p$. Whenever $p$ differs from the golden ratio, asymptotically as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$, the winner of the game is determined. In the case where $p$ equals the golden ratio, we call such a random game a \\emph{golden game}. In golden games the winner is the player that acts first with probability that is equal to the golden ratio. We suggest the notion of \\emph{fragility} as a measure for \"fairness\" of a game's rules. Fragility counts how many leaves' payoffs should be flipped in order to convert the identity of the winning player. Our main result provides a recursive formula for asymptotic fragility of golden games. Surprisingly, golden games are extremely fragile. For instance, with probability $\\approx 0.77$ a losing player could flip a single payoff (out of $2^n$) and become a winner. With probability $\\approx 0.999$ a losing player could flip 3 payoffs and become the winner."

The ansatz is based on finite superpositions of plane waves associated with a dihedral group $D_{2n}$, which enforces the momentums after a series of scattering and reflection processes to fulfill the $D_{2n}$ symmetry. Starting from a two-body elastic collision model in a hard-wall box, we demonstrate how a finite momentum distribution is related to the $D_{2n}$ symmetry and gives the condition of permitted mass ratios corresponding to classical superintegrable points. For a quantum system with mass ratio $3$, we obtain exact eigenenergies and eigenstates by solving Bethe ansatz equations for arbitrary interaction strength. A many-body excited state of the system is found to be independent of the interaction strength, i.e. the wave function looks exactly the same for non-interacting two particles or in the hard-core limit."

        "Abstract": "We review our previous work on the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional arrays of underdamped Josephson junctions placed in a single-mode resonant cavity. Starting from a well-defined model Hamiltonian, which includes the effects of driving current and dissipative coupling to a heat bath, we write down the Heisenberg equations of motion for the variables of the Josephson junction and the cavity mode. In the limit of many photons, these equations reduce to coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically. We present a review of some characteristic numerical results, which show many features similar to experiment. These include self-induced resonant steps (SIRS's) at voltages $V = n\\hbar\\Omega/(2e)$, where $\\Omega$ is the cavity frequency, and $n$ is generally an integer; a threshold number $N_c$ of active rows of junctions above which the array is coherent; and a time-averaged cavity energy which is quadratic in the number of active junctions, when the array is above threshold. When the array is biased on a SIRS, then, for given junction parameters, the power radiated into the array varies as the square of the number of active junctions, consistent with expectations for coherent radiation. For a given step, a two-dimensional array radiates much more energy into the cavity than does a one-dimensional array. Finally, in two dimensions, we find a strong polarization effect: if the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to the direction of current injection in a square array, then it does not couple to the array and no power is radiated into the cavity."

This extends results of Baladi and Vall\\'ee on Gaussian behaviour for costs of moderate growth.   We apply our result to obtain the limiting distribution of values of several key examples of quantum modular forms. We show that central values of the Esterman function ($L$ function of the divisor function twisted by an additive character) tend to have a Gaussian distribution, with a large variance. We give a dynamical, \"trace formula free\" proof that central modular symbols associated with a holomorphic cusp form for $SL(2,{\\bf Z})$ have a Gaussian distribution.

The burst was apparently associated with the optically (restframe UV) brightest component of a system of at least five galaxies or galaxy fragments at a redshift of z = 1.0969. The component we identify as the host galaxy shows a moderately high unobscured star formation rate, SFR = 5 M_solar/yr, but a high SFR per unit mass, indicative of a starburst. The image components show a broad range of (R-K) colors, with two of them being very red, possibly due to dust. Overall morphology of the system can be naturally interpreted as a strong tidal interaction of two or more galaxies, at a redshift where such events were much more common than now. Given the well established causal link between galaxy mergers and starbursts, we propose that this is a strong case for a GRB originating from a merger-induced starburst system. This supports the proposed link between GRBs and massive star formation."

As the Goldstone model, or the O(2) model, can be obtained as a continuum and regular model for the XY model, we define the modified Goldstone model as that of the modified XY model. We construct a vortex, soliton (domain wall), and a molecule of two half-quantized vortices connected by a soliton as regular solutions of the model. Then, we investigate its phase structure in two Euclidean dimensions via the functional renormalization group formalism and full numerical simulations. We argue that field dependence of the wavefunction renormalization factor plays a crucial role in the existence of the line of fixed points describing the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which can ultimately terminate not only one, but at two endpoints in the modified model. This structure confirms that a two-step phase transition of the BKT and Ising types can occur in the system. We compare our renormalization group results with full numerical simulations, which also reveal that the phase transitions show a richer scenario than expected."

The moments of the cross-correlation function between the solar spectrum and a binary line mask contain information about the stellar radial velocity and line-profile distortions caused by stellar activity. As additional indicators, we consider the disc-averaged magnetic flux and the filling factor of the magnetic regions. Here we show that the activity-induced radial-velocity fluctuations are reduced when we apply a kernel regression to these activity indicators. The disc-averaged magnetic flux proves to be the best activity proxy over a timescale of one month and gives a standard deviation of the regression residuals of 1.04 m/s, more than a factor of 2.8 smaller than the standard deviation of the original radial velocity fluctuations. This result has been achieved thanks to the high-cadence and time continuity of the observations that simultaneously sample both the radial velocity and the activity proxies."

In the latter case, the coating is called a Landau-Levich film. Its thickness depends on the angle and velocity of substrate withdrawal. We predict by means of a numerical and analytical investigation of a hydrodynamic thin-film model the existence of a third regime. It consists of the deposition of a regular pattern of liquid ridges oriented parallel to the meniscus. We establish that the mechanism of the underlying meniscus instability originates from competing film dewetting and Landau-Levich film deposition. Our analysis combines a marginal stability analysis, numerical time simulations and a numerical bifurcation study via path-continuation."

        "Abstract": "We study the distribution of bright star-forming complexes in a homogeneous sample of 72 late-type (``irregular'') dwarf galaxies located within the 10 Mpc volume. Star-forming complexes are identified as bright lumps in B-band galaxy images and isolated by means of the unsharp-masking method. For the sample as a whole the radial number distribution of bright lumps largely traces the underlying exponential-disk light profiles, but peaks at a 10 percent smaller scale length. Moreover, the presence of a tail of star forming regions out to at least six optical scale lengths provides evidence against a systematic star formation truncation within that galaxy extension. Considering these findings, we apply a scale length-independent concentration index, taking into account the implied non-uniform random spread of star formation regions throughout the disk. The number profiles frequently manifest a second, minor peak at about two scale lengths. Relying on a two-dimensional stochastic self-propagating star formation model, we show these secondary peaks to be consistent with triggered star formation; for a few of the brighter galaxies a peculiar peak distribution is observed that is conceivably due to the onset of shear provided by differential rotation. On scales between 100 and 1000 pc, and by taking into account exponential-disk structure, bright lumps reveal cluster dimensions between 1.3 and 2, with a weak trend to higher dimensions for brighter galaxies. Interpreting cluster dimension in terms of porosity of a self-similar intragalactic medium, we derive a relation between current star formation rate, scale length, and porosity."

In particular, within the classical context of descent theory, we show that, in a fibred category, the forgetful functor between the category of internal actions of a precategory and the category of internal actions of the underlying discrete precategory is monadic if and only if it has a left adjoint. More particularly, this shows that one of the implications of the celebrated B\\'{e}nabou-Roubaud theorem does not depend on the so called Beck-Chevalley condition.

We examine the Einstein equations induced on a general $(n-2)$-brane of arbitrary tension, embedded in some $n$-dimensional bulk. The brane energy-momentum tensor enters these equations both linearly and quadratically. From the point of view of a homogeneous and isotropic brane we see quadratic deviations from the FRW equations of the standard cosmology. There is also a contribution from a bulk Weyl tensor. We study this in detail when the bulk is AdS-Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om AdS. This contribution can be understood holographically. For the AdS-Schwarzschild case, we show that the geometry on a brane near the AdS boundary is just that of a radiation dominated FRW universe. The radiation comes from a field theory that is dual to the AdS bulk. We also develop a new approach which allows us to consider branes that are not near the AdS boundary. This time the dual field theory contributes quadratic energy density/pressure terms to the FRW equations. Remarkably, these take exactly the same form as for additional matter placed on the brane by hand, with no bulk Weyl tensor.   We also derive the general equations of motion for a braneworld containing a domain wall. For the critical brane, the induced geometry is identical to that of a vacuum domain wall in $(n-1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity. We develop the tools to construct a nested Randall-Sundrum scenario whereby we have a ``critical'' domain wall living on an anti-de Sitter brane. We also show how to construct instantons on the brane, and calculate the probability of false vacuum decay."

We prove the unital property of the adjoint module and the commutativity of tensor products, up to module isomorphism. We relate this tensor product construction with Frenkel and Zhu's $A(M)$-theory. We give a proof of a formula of Frenkel and Zhu for fusion rules. We also give the analogue of the ``Hom''-functor of classical Lie algebra theory for vertex operator algebra theory by introducing a notion of ``generalized intertwining operator.'' We prove that the space of generalized intertwining operators from one module to another for a vertex operator algebra is a generalized module. From this result we derive a general form of Tsuchiya and Kanie's ``nuclear democracy theorem'' for any rational vertex operator algebra. This proves that the fusion rules obtained from our construction of tensor products are the same as the fusion rules obtained by using Tsuchiya and Kanie's method, for both WZW models and minimal models. We prove that if $V$ satisfies certain ``finiteness'' and ``semisimplicity'' conditions, then there exists a unique maximal submodule inside the generalized module. Furthermore, we prove that this maximal submodule is isomorphic to the contragredient module of a certain tensor product module. This gives another construction of tensor product modules and this result turns out to be closely related to Huang and Lepowsky's construction."

I present the MVB in a form which is suitable for estimating uncertainties in problems of astrophysical interest. For many distributions, such as a power-law distribution or an exponential distribution in the presence of a constant background, the MVB can be evaluated in closed form. I give analytic estimates for the variances in several astrophysical problems including the gallium solar-neutrino experiments and the measurement of the polarization induced by a weak gravitational lens. I show that it is possible to make significant improvements in the accuracy of these experiments by making simple adjustments in how they are carried out or analyzed. The actual variance may be above the MVB because of the form of the distribution function and/or the number of observations. I present simple methods for recognizing when this occurs and for obtaining a more accurate estimate of the variance than the MVB when it does."

The two parameter regions in which the different limit cycles exist are separated by a band in which the dynamics exhibit bistability between two branches with different multimode oscillations. Following the states along one path through this bistable region, one observes that each branch undergoes a different transition to chaos, namely a period-doubling cascade and a quasiperiodic route with a torus-breakdown, respectively, making Si electrodissolution one of the few experimental systems exhibiting bichaoticity."

This is by far the smallest separation binary quasar reported to date. The two components have very different spectra, including the presence of strong broad absorption lines (BALs) in component A only. The emission-line redshifts, based on the broad high ionization C IV lines, are z_A = 0.834 and z_B = 0.858; their difference is 3900 km/s in velocity units. The broad C IV lines, however, are probably not a good indicator of systemic redshift; and LBQS 0103-2753 A and B could have a much smaller systemic redshift difference, like the other known binary quasars. If the systemic redshift difference is small, then LBQS 0103-2753 would most likely be a galaxy merger that has led to a binary supermassive black hole. There is now one known 0.3 arcsec binary among roughly 500 QSOs that have been observed in a way that would reveal such a close binary.

These values are slightly larger than previously found as a result of a correction for the contribution from the host galaxy to the late-time ground-based observations and the larger temporal baseline provided by the Hubble Space Telescope observations. The host galaxy is found to contain a very compact core (size <0.25 arcsec) which coincides with the position of the optical transient. The STIS near ultraviolet MAMA observations allow for an investigation of the extinction properties along the line of sight to GRB010222. We find that the far ultraviolet curvature component (c_4) is rather large.

Spectral graph theory provides a set of useful techniques and models for understanding `patterns of interconnectedness' in a graph. Our prime focus in this paper is on the following question: Is there a unified explanation and description of the fundamental spectral graph methods? There are at least two reasons to be interested in this question. Firstly, to gain a much deeper and refined understanding of the basic foundational principles, and secondly, to derive rich consequences with practical significance for algorithm design. However, despite half a century of research, this question remains one of the most formidable open issues, if not the core problem in modern network science. The achievement of this paper is to take a step towards answering this question by discovering a simple, yet universal statistical logic of spectral graph analysis. The prescribed viewpoint appears to be good enough to accommodate almost all existing spectral graph techniques as a consequence of just one single formalism and algorithm."

        "Abstract": "This paper describes a general investigation of stationary oscillations of galaxies. It begins with a linear analysis of modes of oscillation with continuous spectra of real frequencies. Such modes are gravitational analogues of the van Kampen modes of oscillation in plasmas. The characteristic value problem governing modes of the van Kampen type in a galaxy is solved with the aid of a modified version of the matrix method of Kalnajs in which the perturbation of the distribution function is expressed in terms of generalized functions. In general, there is no characteristic equation governing the frequencies in the continuous spectrum. However, isolated frequencies in the continuous spectrum do satisfy a characteristic equation which, for stellar systems, is a counterpart of the dispersion relation proposed by Vlasov for plasma oscillations. The linear analysis also provides a characteristic equation for modes with a discrete spectrum of real and/or complex frequencies. The second part of the paper describes a perturbation theory for a stationary oscillation of a galaxy with a small but finite amplitude. Integrals of the stellar motion are constructed with the aid of canonical perturbation theory and used in conjunction with the theorem of Jeans in order to specify the density of stars in the six-dimensional phase space. These oscillations are slightly nonlinear counterparts of the modes of the van Kampen type, and they are stellar-dynamical counterparts of the nonlinear plasma waves described by Bernstein, Greene, and Kruskal. Fully nonlinear models of stationary oscillations of galaxies can be constructed with the aid of Schwarzschild's numerical method for the solution of the fundamental integral equation describing the self-consistency of a stellar system."

        "Abstract": "The center of our disk galaxy, the Milky Way, is dominated by a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. Numerous studies of the bulge based on stellar photometry have concluded that the bulge stars are exclusively old. The perceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its likely formation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a unique population that formed early and separately from the disk. However, recent studies of individual bulge stars using the microlensing technique have reported that they span a range of ages, emphasizing that the bulge may not be a monolithic structure. In this letter we demonstrate that the presence of young stars that are located predominantly near the plane is expected for a bulge that has formed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. Using an N-body+SPH simulation of a disk galaxy forming out of gas cooling inside a dark matter halo and forming stars, we find a qualitative agreement between our model and the observations of young metal-rich stars in the bulge. We are also able to partially resolve the apparent contradiction in the literature between results that argue for a purely old bulge population and those which show a population comprised of a range in ages; the key is where to look."

A striking result is a common mean observed radio luminosity from the black hole candidates (BHCs) in the Low/Hard X-ray state and the neutron-star Z sources on the horizontal X-ray branch. This implies a common mean intrinsic radio luminosity to within a factor of twenty five (or less, if there is significant Doppler boosting of the radio emission). Unless coincidental, these results imply a physical mechanism for jet formation which requires neither a black hole event horizon or a neutron star surface. As a whole the populations of Atoll and X-ray pulsar systems are less luminous by factors of >5 and >10 at radio wavelengths than the BHCs and Z sources (while some Atoll sources have been detected, no high-field X-ray pulsar has ever been reliably detected as a radio source). We suggest that all of the persistent BHCs and the Z sources generate, at least sporadically, an outflow with physical dimensions > 1e12cm, i.e. significantly larger than the binary separations of most of the systems. We compare the physical conditions of accretion in each of the types of persistent X-ray binary and conclude that a relatively low (<1e10 G) magnetic field associated with the accreting object, and a high (>0.1 Eddington) accretion rate and/or dramatic physical change in the accretion flow, are required for formation of a radio-emitting outflow or jet."

Whereas modern deep learning approaches are successful at hallucinating plausible HDR content from a single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image, saturated scene details often cannot be faithfully recovered. Inspired by recent deep optical imaging approaches, we interpret this problem as jointly training an optical encoder and electronic decoder where the encoder is parameterized by the point spread function (PSF) of the lens, the bottleneck is the sensor with a limited dynamic range, and the decoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN). The lens surface is then jointly optimized with the CNN in a training phase; we fabricate this optimized optical element and attach it as a hardware add-on to a conventional camera during inference. In extensive simulations and with a physical prototype, we demonstrate that this end-to-end deep optical imaging approach to single-shot HDR imaging outperforms both purely CNN-based approaches and other PSF engineering approaches."

We use their data, together with a direct capture model and a USD shell model calculation to derive a new reaction rate for use in astrophysical model calculations. In particular, we take into account capture on the first excited state in $^{32}$Cl, and also present a realistic estimate of the remaining uncertainties. We find that the $^{32}$Cl(p,$\\gamma$)$^{33}$Ar reaction rate is dominated entirely by capture on the first excited state in $^{32}$Cl over the whole temperature range relevant in X-ray bursts. In the temperature range from 0.2 to 1 GK the rate is up to a factor of 70 larger than the previously recommended rate based on shell model calculations only. The uncertainty is now reduced from up to a factor of 1000 to a factor of 3 at 0.3-0.7 GK and a factor of 6 at 1.5 GK."

        "Abstract": "A new gauge theory of gravity is presented. The theory is constructed in a flat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations between physical quantities are independent of the positions and orientations of the matter fields. In this manner all properties of the background spacetime are removed from physics, and what remains are a set of `intrinsic' relations between physical fields. The properties of the gravitational gauge fields are derived from both classical and quantum viewpoints. Field equations are then derived from an action principle, and consistency with the minimal coupling procedure selects an action that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant. This in turn singles out a unique form of spin-torsion interaction. A new method for solving the field equations is outlined and applied to the case of a time-dependent, spherically-symmetric perfect fluid. A gauge is found which reduces the physics to a set of essentially Newtonian equations. These equations are then applied to the study of cosmology, and to the formation and properties of black holes. The existence of global solutions enables one to discuss the properties of field lines inside the horizon due to a point charge held outside it. The Dirac equation is studied in a black hole background and provides a quick derivation of the Hawking temperature."

TeV gamma-ray measurements of its flaring activity and spectral variability have placed constraints on models of the high-energy emission from blazars. However, observations between 50 and 300 GeV are rare, and the high-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED), predicted to be in this range, has never been directly detected. We present a detection of Mrk 421 above 100 GeV as made by the Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) during a multiwavelength campaign in early 2004. STACEE is a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescope using the wavefront sampling technique to detect gamma rays at lower energies than achieved by most imaging Cherenkov telescopes. We also outline a method for reconstructing gamma-ray energies using a solar heliostat telescope. This technique was applied to the 2004 data, and we present the differential energy spectrum of Mrk 421 above 130 GeV. Assuming a differential photon flux dN/dE proportional to E^-a, we measure a spectral index a = 2.1 +/- 0.2 (statistical) +0.2/-0.1 (systematic). Finally, we discuss the STACEE spectrum in the context of the multiwavelength results from the same epoch."

This paper focuses on accessing data stored in disparate relational databases through a web service interface, and exploits the features of a Data Warehouse and Data Marts. We present a middleware that enables applications to access data stored in geographically distributed relational databases without being aware of their physical locations and underlying schema. A web service interface is provided to enable applications to access this middleware in a language and platform independent way. A prototype implementation was created based on Clarens [4], Unity [7] and POOL [8]. This ability to access the data stored in the distributed relational databases transparently is likely to be a very powerful one for Grid users, especially the scientific community wishing to collate and analyze data distributed over the Grid."

        "Abstract": "Monte Carlo simulations and variational calculations using a Gaussian ansatz are applied to a model consisting of a flexible linear polyelectrolyte chain as well as to an intrinsically stiff chain with up to 1000 charged monomers. Addition of salt is treated implicitly through a screened Coulomb potential for the electrostatic interactions.   For the flexible model the electrostatic persistence length shows roughly three regimes in its dependence on the Debye-H\\\"{u}ckel screening length, $\\kappa^{-1}$.As long as the salt content is low and $\\kappa^{-1}$ is longer than the end-to-end distance, the electrostatic persistence length varies only slowly with $\\kappa^{-1}$. Decreasing the screening length, a controversial region is entered. We find that the electrostatic persistence length scales as $sqrt{\\xi_p}/\\kappa$, in agreement with experiment on flexible polyelectrolytes, where $\\xi_p$ is a strength parameter measuring the electrostatic interactions within the polyelectrolyte. For screening lengths much shorter than the bond length, the $\\kappa^{-1}$ dependence becomes quadratic in the variational calculation. The simulations suffer from numerical problems in this regime, but seem to give a relationship half-way between linear and quadratic.   A low temperature expansion only reproduces the first regime and a high temperature expansion, which treats the electrostatic interactions as a perturbation to a Gaussian chain, gives a quadratic dependence on the Debye length.   For a sufficiently stiff chain, the persistence length varies quadratically with $\\kappa^{-1}$ in agreement with earlier theories."

The model was stimulated by our discovery that a majority of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used in other papers (cond-mat/0212043). It accounted quantitatively for several properties of empirically observed distribution of citations. However, important features, such as power-law distribution of citations to papers published during the same year and the fact that the average rate of citing decreases with aging of a paper, were not accounted for by that model. Here we propose a modified model: when a scientist writes a manuscript, he picks up several random recent papers, cites them and also copies some of their references. The difference with the original model is the word recent. We solve the model using methods of the theory of branching processes, and find that it can explain the aforementioned features of citation distribution, which our original model couldn't account for. The model can also explain \"sleeping beauties in science\", i.e., papers that are little cited for a decade or so, and later \"awake\" and get a lot of citations. Although much can be understood from purely random models, we find that to obtain a good quantitative agreement with empirical citation data one must introduce Darwinian fitness parameter for the papers."

Most of the studies that point to this result are nonetheless based on perturbative quantization approaches, in which the effect of matter on the geometry is regarded as a correction to a classical background. In this paper, we consider rainbow spacetimes constructed from doubly special relativity by using a modification of the proposals of Magueijo and Smolin. In these models, gravitational effects are incorporated (at least to a certain extent) in the definition of the energy-momentum of particles without adhering to a perturbative treatment of the back reaction. In this context, we derive and compare the expressions of the time uncertainty in quantizations that use as evolution parameter either the background or the rainbow time coordinates. These two possibilities can be regarded as corresponding to perturbative and non-perturbative quantization schemes, respectively. We show that, while a non-vanishing time uncertainty is generically unavoidable in a perturbative framework, an infinite time resolution can in fact be achieved in a non-perturbative quantization for the whole family of doubly special relativity theories with unbounded physical energy."

Taking the superposition $Z$ of these two processes, two points of $Z$ are linked by an edge if and only if they are sufficiently close and located on the same edge of the supporting tessellation. We study the percolation of the random graph arising from this construction and prove that a subcritical phase as well as a supercritical phase exist under general assumptions. Our proofs are based on a renormalization argument with some notion of stabilization and asymptotic essential connectedness to investigate continuum percolation for Cox point processes. We also give numerical estimates of the critical parameters of the model.

Most metrology schemes measure a single parameter of a dynamical process by probing it with a specially designed quantum state. The success of such a scheme usually relies on the process belonging to a particular one-parameter family. If this assumption is violated, or if the goal is to measure more than one parameter, a different quantum state may perform better. In the most extreme case, we know nothing about the process and wish to learn everything. This requires quantum process tomography, which demands an informationally-complete set of probe states. It is very convenient if this set is group-covariant -- i.e., each element is generated by applying an element of the quantum system's natural symmetry group to a single fixed fiducial state. In this paper, we consider metrology with 2-photon (\"biphoton\") states, and report experimental studies of different states' sensitivity to small, unknown collective SU(2) rotations (\"SU(2) jitter\"). Maximally entangled N00N states are the most sensitive detectors of such a rotation, yet they are also among the worst at fully characterizing an a-priori unknown process. We identify (and confirm experimentally) the best SU(2)-covariant set for process tomography; these states are all less entangled than the N00N state, and are characterized by the fact that they form a 2-design."

Small telescopes can readily capture exoplanet transits under good weather conditions when the combination of a bright star and a large transiting exoplanet results in a significant depth of transit. However, in reality there are many considerations that need to be made in order to obtain useful measurements. This paper and accompanying website layout a procedure based on time series differential photometry that has been successfully employed using 0.4m aperture telescopes to predict the expected precision for a whole light curve. This enables robust planning to decide whether the observation of a particular exoplanet transit should be attempted and in particular to be able to readily see when it should not to be attempted. This may result in a significant increase in the number of transit observations captured by non-specialists. The technique and website are also appropriate for planning a variety of variable star observations where a prediction of the light curve can be made."

Yet the wavefront-based point of view is natural and provides insights into the nature of the caustic surfaces on a gravitationally lensed lightcone. We derive analytically the basic equations governing the wavefronts, lightcones, caustics on wavefronts, and caustic surfaces on lightcones in the context of weak-field, thin-screen gravitational lensing. These equations are all related to the potential of the lens. In the process, we also show that the standard single-plane gravitational lensing map extends to a new mapping, which we call a wavefront lensing map. Unlike the standard lensing map, the Jacobian matrix of a wavefront lensing map is not symmetric. Our formulas are then applied to caustic ``surfing.'' By surfing a caustic surface, a space-borne telescope can be fixed on a gravitationally lensed source to obtain an observation of the source at very high magnification over an extended time period, revealing structure about the source that could not otherwise be resolved. Using our analytical expressions for caustic sheets, we present a scheme for surfing a caustic sheet of a lensed source in rectilinear motion. Detailed illustrations are also presented of the possible types of wavefronts and caustic sheets due to nonsingular and singular elliptical potentials, and singular isothermal spheres, including an example of caustic surfing for a singular elliptical potential lens."

Our approach is (1) to examine the observed projected rotational velocities among a large sample of newly-formed stars spanning a range in mass between 0.2 and 50 M ; and (2) to search for evidence of a discontinuity in rotational properties that might indicate a difference in the stellar formation process at some characteristic mass. Our database includes both recently published values of v sin i for young intermediate- and low- mass stars in Orion, as well as new observations of O stars located in young clusters and OB associations. We find that the median of the quantity v_obs/v_c (observed rotational speed/equatorial breakup velocity) is typically about 0.15 and shows no evidence of a discontinuity over the full range of stellar masses, while the quantity Jsini/M (derived angular momentum per unit mass) exhibits a slow, monotonic rise with increasing mass with no evidence of a discontinuity. We suggest that these observations are most simply interpreted as indicative of a single stellar formation and angular momentum regulation mechanism: one that results in rotation rates well below breakup, and angular momenta per unit mass that differ systematically by no more than a factor of 3-4 over a mass range spanning a factor of 250."

We then apply our procedure to measurements of thermoelectric response of a single quantum dot, and demonstrate how it can be used to deduce the entropy change across Coulomb-blockade valleys, resolving, along the way, a long standing puzzle of the experimentally observed finite thermoelectric response at the apparent particle-hole symmetric point."

        "Abstract": "We initiate a study of algorithms with a focus on the computational complexity of individual elements, and introduce the fragile complexity of comparison-based algorithms as the maximal number of comparisons any individual element takes part in. We give a number of upper and lower bounds on the fragile complexity for fundamental problems, including Minimum, Selection, Sorting and Heap Construction. The results include both deterministic and randomized upper and lower bounds, and demonstrate a separation between the two settings for a number of problems. The depth of a comparator network is a straight-forward upper bound on the worst case fragile complexity of the corresponding fragile algorithm. We prove that fragile complexity is a different and strictly easier property than the depth of comparator networks, in the sense that for some problems a fragile complexity equal to the best network depth can be achieved with less total work and that with randomization, even a lower fragile complexity is possible."

This represents the physical situation, which could for instance have appeared in the early universe, where a cosmic membrane (thin domain wall) is located near a black hole. Considering stationary axially symmetric membranes, three different membrane-topologies are possible depending on the boundary conditions at infinity: 2+1 Minkowski topology, 2+1 wormhole topology and 2+1 black hole topology.   Interestingly, we find that the different membrane-topologies are connected via phase transitions of the form first discussed by Choptuik in investigations of scalar field collapse. More precisely, we find a first order phase transition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black hole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between Minkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a naked singularity.   For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation analogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the parameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions. We find that $Mass\\propto|\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_*|^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma\\approx 0.66$. We also find a periodic wiggle in the scaling relation.   Our results show that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is far more general than expected."

Two main regimes have been discussed, {\\it hydromagnetic outflows}, which have a significant mass flux and have energy and angular momentum carried by both the matter and the electromagnetic field and, Poynting outflows, where the mass flux is negligible and energy and angular momentum are carried predominantly by the electromagnetic field. Here we consider a Keplerian disk initially threaded by a dipole-like magnetic field and we present solutions of the force-free Grad-Shafranov equation for the coronal plasma. We find solutions with Poynting jets where there is a continuous outflow of energy and toroidal magnetic flux from the disk into the external space. This behavior contradicts the commonly accepted ``theorem'' of Solar plasma physics that the motion of the footpoints of a magnetic loop structure leads to a stationary magnetic field configuration with zero power and flux outflows.   In addition we discuss recent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which establish that quasi-stationary collimated Poynting jets similar to our Grad-Shafranov solutions arise from the inner part of a disk threaded by a dipole-like magnetic field. At the same time we find that there is a steady uncollimated hydromagnetic outflow from the outer part of the disk. The Poynting jets represent a likely model for the jets from active galactic nuclei, microquasars, and gamma ray burst sources."

E 62, 6071 (2000)] by means of detailed Monte Carlo simulations in one and two dimensions. Particles of type A may independently hop to an adjacent lattice site provided it is occupied by at least one B particle. The B particle species undergoes diffusion-limited reactions. In an active state with nonzero, essentially homogeneous B particle saturation density, the A species displays normal diffusion. In an inactive, absorbing phase with exponentially decaying B density, the A particles become localized. In situations with algebraic decay rho_B(t) ~ t^{-alpha_B}, as occuring either at a non-equilibrium continuous phase transition separating active and absorbing states, or in a power-law inactive phase, the A particles propagate subdiffusively with mean-square displacement <x(t)^2_A> ~ t^{1-alpha_A}. We find that within the accuracy of our simulation data, \\alpha_A = \\alpha_B as predicted by a simple mean-field approach. This remains true even in the presence of strong spatio-temporal fluctuations of the B density. However, in contrast with the mean-field results, our data yield a distinctly non-Gaussian A particle displacement distribution n_A(x,t) that obeys dynamic scaling and looks remarkably similar for the different processes investigated here. Fluctuations of effective diffusion rates cause a marked enhancement of n_A(x,t) at low displacements |x|, indicating a considerable fraction of practically localized A particles, as well as at large traversed distances."

This procedure is used to transform this nonlinear evolution-diffusion equation into a hyperbolic PDE; specifically, a second order quasi-linear wave equation. An immediate implication of this procedure is the formation of a least action principle for the balance of energy with dissipation. The corresponding action functional enables us to establish a complete analytical mechanics for thermomechanical systems: a Lagrangian-Hamiltonian theory, bracket formalism, and Noether's theorem. Furthermore, we apply our procedure iteratively and produce an infinite sequence of interlocked variational principles, a \\emph{variational hierarchy}, where at each level or iteration the full implication of the least action principle can be again shown.

        "Abstract": "Assuming that the interchange convection of magnetic flux elements is the physical cause for the existence of filamentary penumbrae in sunspots, we investigate the behavior of an individual fibril embedded in the deep penumbra. The fibril is approximated by a thin magnetic flux tube which evolves dynamically in the environment given by the global magnetostatic model of a sunspot.   Our simulation shows that the flux tube, initially positioned at the penumbra--quiet Sun boundary in the model, will rise through its deep penumbra developing a flow along the tube that points upward beneath the photosphere, and radially outward above the photosphere. Our results suggest that a bright filament may be formed by an extended tail of a penumbral grain. Such filaments are optically thick, hotter than the surroundings, and elevated above a darker background. An upflow in penumbral grains bends horizontally outwards above the photosphere and gradually cools down due to radiative losses leading to a tail that gradually darkens. The plasma flow inside the flux tube then becomes transparent and the tube constitutes a thin elevated flow channel, that can reproduce the observed features of the Evershed effect. We present also a new acceleration mechanism for the Evershed flow. It is demonstrated that a local surplus of gas pressure develops inside the tube as it rises through the specific (superadiabatic and magnetized) penumbral background. The resulting gradient of the gas pressure can drive the flow along the tube."

Because the Riemannian geometry cannot explain the presence of magnetic monopoles, then we propose a torsional geometry in order to explore the possibility that magnetic monopoles can be geometrically induced. We obtain an expression that relates torsion and magnetic fields jointly with a Dirac-like expression for magnetic and electric charges, such that torsion makes possible define a fundamental length that provides a magnetic field and a spacetime discretization."

        "Abstract": "Held has proposed a coordinate- and gauge-free integration procedure within the GHP formalism built around four functionally independent zero-weighted scalars constructed from the spin coefficients and the Riemann tensor components. Unfortunately, a spacetime with Killing vectors will be unable to supply the full quota of four scalars of this type. However, for such a spacetime additional scalars are supplied by the components of the Killing vectors; by using these alongside the spin coefficients and the Riemann tensor components we have the possibility of constructing the full quota of four functionally independent zero-weighted scalars, and of exploiting Held's procedure.   As an illustration we investigate the vacuum Type N spaces admitting a Killing vector and a homothetic Killing vector. In a direct manner, we reduce the problem to a pair of ordinary differential operator `master equations', making use of a new zero-weighted GHP operator. By first rewriting the master equations as a closed set of complex first order equations, we reduce the problem to one real third order operator differential equation for a complex function of a real variable --- but with still the freedom to choose explicitly our fourth coordinate. An alternative, more algorithmic approach, using a closed chain of real first order equations for real functions, reduces the problem to the same order, but in a more natural and much more concise form. It is also outlined how the various other third order differential equations, which have been derived previously by other workers on this problem, can be deduced from our master equations."

We propose two different backgrounds to deal with higher order implicit Lagrangian theories: the Ostrogradsky approach and the Schmidt transform, which convert a higher order Lagrangian into a first order one. The Ostrogradsky approach involves the addition of new independent variables to account for higher order derivatives, whilst the Schmidt transform adds gauge invariant terms to the Lagrangian function. In these two settings, the implicit character of the resulting equations will be treated in two different ways in order to provide a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. On one hand, the implicit differential equation will be a Lagrangian submanifold of a higher order tangent bundle and it is generated by a Morse family. On the other hand, we will rely on the existence of an auxiliary section of a certain bundle that allows the construction of local vector fields, even if the differential equations are implicit. We will illustrate some examples of our proposed schemes, and discuss the applicability of the proposal."

We consider a renewable energy generation process that fully charges the RB at random time instants, and its realization is assumed to be known also by the UP. We reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solve it by dynamic programming (DP) to design battery charging and discharging policies that minimize a linear combination of the privacy leakage and energy cost. We also propose a lower bound and two alternative low-complexity energy management policies, one of which is shown numerically to perform close to the MDP solution."

The LB method is used as a model for the solvent in order to take into account the hydrodynamic mass and momentum transport through the solvent. The colloidal particles are propagated via MD and they are coupled to the LB fluid by viscous forces. With respect to the LB fluid, the colloids are represented by uniformly distributed points on a sphere. Each such point (with a velocity V(r) at any off-lattice position r is interacting with the neighboring eight LB nodes by a frictional force F=\\xi_0(V(r)-u(r)) with \\xi_0 being a friction force and u(r) being the velocity of the fluid at the position r. Thermal fluctuations are introduced in the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics. This coupling scheme has been proposed recently for polymer systems by Ahlrichs and D\"unweg [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 8225 (1999)]. We investigate several properties of a single colloidal particle in a LB fluid, namely the effective Stokes friction and long time tails in the autocorrelation functions for the translational and rotational velocity. Moreover, a charged colloidal system is considered consisting of a macroion, counterions and coions that are coupled to a LB fluid. We study the behavior of the ions in a constant electric field. In particular, an estimate of the effective charge of the macroion is yielded from the number of counterions that move with the macroion in the direction of the electric field."

In this work we have studied analytically and numerically the late-time behaviour of these type of cosmologies taking a proper care of the annihilation of winding modes. This has help us to clarify and extend several aspects of their dynamics. We have found that the decay of winding states into non-winding states behaving like a gas of ordinary non-relativistic particles precludes the existence of a late expansion phase of the universe and obstructs the growth of three large spatial dimensions as we observe today. We propose a generic solution to this problem by considering the dynamics of a gas of non-static branes. We have also obtained a simple criterion on the initial conditions to ensure the small string coupling approximation along the whole dynamical evolution, and consequently, the consistency of an effective low-energy description. Finally, we have reexamined the general conditions for a loitering period in the evolution of the universe which could serve as a mechanism to resolve the {\\sl brane problem} - a problem equivalent to the {\\sl domain wall problem} in standard cosmology - and discussed the scaling properties of a self-interacting network of winding modes taking into account the effects of the dilaton dynamics."

Placing the sample under a uniform pressure load results in bulging of the graphene membrane and subsequent softening of the main Raman features, due to tensile strain. In such a microcavity, the intensity of the Raman features depends very sensitively on the distance between the graphene membrane and the Si substrate, which acts as the bottom mirror of the cavity. Thus, a spatially resolved analysis of the intensity of the G- and 2D-mode features as a function of the pressure load permits a direct reconstruction of the blister profile. An average strain is then deduced at each pressure load, and Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameters of $1.8\\pm0.2$ and $2.4\\pm0.2$ are determined for the Raman G and 2D modes, respectively. In addition, the measured blister height is proportional to the cubic root of the pressure load, as predicted theoretically. The validation of this scaling provides a direct and accurate determination the Young's modulus of graphene with a purely optical, hence contactless and minimally invasive, approach. We find a Young's modulus of $(1.05\\pm 0.10) \\rm TPa$ for monolayer graphene, in a perfect match with previous nanoindentation measurements.

The lens is a smooth elliptical galaxy at a redshift of z_l = 0.2046 +/- 0.0001 with a Sloan r-band magnitude of 17.00 +/- 0.05 and a stellar velocity dispersion of 267 +/- 17 km s^-1, obtained from its SDSS spectrum. Multiple emission lines place the quadruply-imaged source at a redshift of z_s = 0.4814 +/- 0.0001. The best-fitting singular isothermal ellipsoid lens model gives an Einstein radius b = 1.35\" +/- 0.05\" (or [4.9 +/- 0.2] h_65^-1 kpc), corresponding to a total mass of (30.9 +/- 2.3) x 10^10 h_65^-1 M_sun within the critical curve.

The lens model predicts a luminosity-weighted stellar dispersion within the 3\"-diameter SDSS aperture of sigma_* ~= 270 km s^-1, in good agreement with the observed value.

The absence of inversion symmetry is very uncommon in metals, particularly metallic oxides.

A relativistically-broadened iron line at ~6.4 keV is clearly resolved in the time-averaged spectrum, with an equivalent width of 310^{+70}_{-90} eV. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the heavily absorbed soft X-ray band confirms the existence of a variable, multi-zone warm absorber in this source, as proposed in a previous analysis of a shorter ASCA observation. The light curve of the source is wildly variable on timescales of hours or less, and a factor of nearly 10 change in count-rate was recorded in a period of less than 2000 s. The long observation and variability of the source allowed the power density spectrum (PDS) to be constructed to an unprecedented level of detail. There is evidence for a break in the PDS from a slope of \\alpha~1 to \\alpha~1.8 at a frequency of around 3 \\times 10^{-4} Hz.

This minimal B-L MSSM can have a colored/charged LSP, of which a stop LSP is the most amenable to observation at the LHC. We study the R-parity violating decays of a stop LSP into a bottom quark and charged leptons--the dominant modes for a generic \"admixture\" stop. A numerical analysis of the relative branching ratios of these decay channels is given using a wide scan over the parameter space. The fact that R-parity is violated in this theory by a vacuum expectation value of a sneutrino links these branching ratios directly to the neutrino mass hierarchy. It is shown how a discovery of bottom-charged lepton events at the LHC can potentially determine whether the neutrino masses are in a normal or inverted hierarchy, as well as determining the theta_23 neutrino mixing angle. Finally, present LHC bounds on these leptoquark signatures are used to put lower bounds on the stop mass."

For a certain election of the cosmological and Gauss-Bonnet coupling constants, we derive two classes of AdS black hole solutions whose horizon is planar. The first family of black holes obtained for a particular value of the nonminimal coupling parameter only depends on a constant M, and the scalar field vanishes as M=0. The second class of solutions corresponds to a two-parametric (with constants M and A) black hole stealth configuration, that is a nontrivial scalar field with a black hole metric such that both side (gravity and matter parts) of the Einstein equations vanishes. In this case, in the vanishing M, the solution reduces to a stealth scalar field on the pure AdS metric. We note that the existence of these two classes of solutions is inherent of the particular choice of the coupling constants and, they can not be promoted to spherical or hyperboloid black hole solutions in a standard fashion. In the last part, we add to the original action some exacts (D-1)-forms coupled to the scalar field. The direct benefit of introducing such extra fields is to obtain black hole solutions with planar horizon for arbitrary value of the nonminimal coupling parameter."

        "Abstract": "Let $G$ be a directed graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and let $s \\in V(G)$ be a designated source vertex. We consider the problem of single source reachability (SSR) from $s$ in presence of failures of edges (or vertices). Formally, a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a {\\em $k$-Fault Tolerant Reachability Subgraph ($k$-FTRS)} if it has the following property. For any set $F$ of at most $k$ edges (or vertices) in $G$, and for any vertex $v\\in V(G)$, the vertex $v$ is reachable from $s$ in $G-F$ if and only if it is reachable from $s$ in $H - F$. Baswana et.al. [STOC 2016, SICOMP 2018] showed that in the setting above, for any positive integer $k$, we can compute a $k$-FTRS with $2^k n$ edges. In this paper, we give a much simpler algorithm for computing a $k$-FTRS, and observe that it extends to higher connectivity as well. Our results follow from a simple application of \\emph{important separators}, a well known technique in Parameterized Complexity."

        "Abstract": "We report on the observation of a very small glitch observed for the first time in a millisecond pulsar, PSR B1821-24 located in the globular cluster M28. Timing observations were mainly conducted with the Nancay radiotelescope (France) and confirmation comes from the 140ft radiotelescope at Green Bank and the new Green Bank Telescope data. This event is characterized by a rotation frequency step of 3 nHz, or 10^-11 in fractional frequency change along with a short duration limited to a few days or a week. A marginally significant frequency derivative step was also found. This glitch follows the main characteristics of those in the slow period pulsars, but is two orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest ever recorded. Such an event must be very rare for millisecond pulsars since no other glitches have been detected when the cumulated number of years of millisecond pulsar timing observations up to 2001 is around 500 for all these objects. However, pulsar PSR B1821-24 is one of the youngest among the old recycled ones and there is likely a correlation between age, or a related parameter, and timing noise. While this event happens on a much smaller scale, the required adjustment of the star to a new equilibrium figure as it spins down is a likely common cause for all glitches."

Typically, those techniques generate non-deterministic finite state automata, which can be determinized at a possibly exponential cost. Recent results show multiple advantages of using deterministic automata in symbolic and bounded model checking of LTL safety properties. In this paper, we present a technique with a supporting tool that takes a sequential extended regular expression specification {\\Phi}, and a logic design implementation S, and generates a sequential circuit C, expressed as an And-Inverted-Graph, that checks whether S satisfies {\\Phi}. The technique passes the generated circuit C to ABC, a bounded model checker, to validate correctness. We use free input variables to encode the non- determinism in {\\Phi} and we obtain a number of states in miter linear in the size of {\\Phi}. Our technique succeeds to generate the input to the model checker while other techniques fail because of the exponential blowup, and in most cases, ABC succeeds to either find defects in the design that was otherwise uncheckable, or validate the design.

A standard scan, which involves no correction for the differential drift rates and curved stellar paths across the field-of-view, suffers from severe image degradation even when one observes at moderate declinations. Not only does this effect limit the area of the sky over which drift scanning is viable, but as detector sizes increase, CCD mosaics become standard, and dome/telescope seeing improves, the area of sky for which scanning is acceptable (image degradation $\\ltsim$ seeing) will be further reduced unless some action is taken. By modifying the scan path (the path on the sky traced by signal accumulated along a single CCD column) to lie along a great circle on the sky rather than along a path of constant declination, image degradation is minimized. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a stage that rotates and translates the CCD during a drift-scan exposure so that the scan path is along a great circle on the sky. Data obtained during the commissioning run of the Great Circle Camera at the Las Campanas 1-m telescope are presented."

        "Abstract": "We consider non-local effects which arise when radiation emitted at one radius of an accretion disk either heats or cools gas at other radii through Compton scattering. We discuss three situations:   1. Radiation from the inner regions of an advection-dominated flow Compton cooling gas at intermediate radii and Compton heating gas at large radii.   2. Soft radiation from an outer thin accretion disk Compton cooling a hot one- or two-temperature flow on the inside.   3. Soft radiation from an inner thin accretion disk Compton cooling hot gas in a surrounding one-temperature flow.   We describe how previous results are modified by these non-local interactions. We find that Compton heating or cooling of the gas by the radiation emitted in the inner regions of a hot flow is not important. Likewise, Compton cooling by the soft photons from an outer thin disk is negligible when the transition from a cold to a hot flow occurs at a radius greater than some minimum $R_{tr,min}$. However, if the hot flow terminates at $R < R_{tr,min}$, non-local cooling is so strong that the hot gas is cooled to a thin disk configuration in a runaway process. In the case of a thin disk surrounded by a hot one-temperature flow, we find that Compton cooling by soft radiation dominates over local cooling in the hot gas for $\\dot{M} \\gsim 10^{-3} \\alpha \\dot{M}_{Edd}$, and $R \\lsim 10^4 R_{Schw}$. As a result, the maximum accretion rate for which an advection-dominated one-temperature solution exists, decreases by a factor of $\\sim 10$, compared to the value computed under an assumption of local energy balance."

We employ a model of 2d gravity modified by the $R^2$ term as a tool to understand such distributions through the typical scale. This model is obtained by adding an interaction term with a typical scale to a scale invariant system. A distribution derived in the model provides power law one in the large scale region, but Weibull-like one in the small scale region. As examples of distributions which have both fractal and non-fractal regions, we take those of personal income and citation number of scientific papers. We show that these distributions are fitted fairly well by the distribution curves derived analytically in the $R^2$ 2d gravity model. As a result, we consider that the typical scale is a useful concept to understand various distributions observed in the real world in a unified way. We also point out that the $R^2$ 2d gravity model provides us with an effective tool to read the typical scales of various distributions in a systematic way."

For a certain election of the cosmological and Gauss-Bonnet coupling constants, we derive two classes of AdS black hole solutions whose horizon is planar. The first family of black holes obtained for a particular value of the nonminimal coupling parameter only depends on a constant M, and the scalar field vanishes as M=0. The second class of solutions corresponds to a two-parametric (with constants M and A) black hole stealth configuration, that is a nontrivial scalar field with a black hole metric such that both side (gravity and matter parts) of the Einstein equations vanishes. In this case, in the vanishing M, the solution reduces to a stealth scalar field on the pure AdS metric. We note that the existence of these two classes of solutions is inherent of the particular choice of the coupling constants and, they can not be promoted to spherical or hyperboloid black hole solutions in a standard fashion. In the last part, we add to the original action some exacts (D-1)-forms coupled to the scalar field. The direct benefit of introducing such extra fields is to obtain black hole solutions with planar horizon for arbitrary value of the nonminimal coupling parameter."

These algorithms are based on Wiebe's characterisation of 0-dimensional local complete intersections via the 0-th Fitting ideal of the maximal ideal. They allow us to detect which generators of I form a regular sequence resp. a strict regular sequence, and they work over an arbitrary base field K. Using degree filtered border bases, we can detect strict complete intersections in certain families of 0-dimensional ideals."

Our approach utilizes the fact that a network modelled from a single non-interacting Gaussian chain of macroscopic size can be solved exactly, even for randomly distributed crosslinking junctions. We derive an {\\it exact} expression for the partition function of such a generalized Gaussian structure in the presence of random external fields and for its scattering function $S_0$. We show that $S_0$ of a randomly crosslinked Gaussian network (RCGN) is a self-averaging quantity and depends only on crosslink concentration $M/N$, where $M$ and $N$ are the total numbers of crosslinks and monomers. From our derivation we find that the radius of gyration $R_{\\mbox{\\tiny g}}$ of a RCGN is of the universal form $R_{\\mbox{\\tiny g}}^2=(0.26 \\pm 0.01)a^2 N/M$, with $a$ being the Kuhn length. To treat the excluded volume effect in a systematic, perturbative manner, we expand the Deam-Edwards partition function in terms of density fluctuations analogous to the theory of linear polymers. For a highly crosslinked interacting network we derive an expression for the free energy of the system in terms of $S_0$ which has the same role in our model as the Debye function for linear polymers. Our ideas are easily generalized to crosslinked polymer blends which are treated within a modified version of Leibler's mean field theory for block copolymers."

Based on a continuum model at valley $K$ or $K'$, we show that there exist two distinct physical origins of QAH effect at two different limits. For $M/\\lambda_R\\gg1$, the quantization of Hall conductance in the absence of Landau-level quantization can be regarded as a summation of the topological charges carried by Skyrmions from real spin textures and Merons from \\emph{AB} sublattice pseudo-spin textures; while for $\\lambda_R/M\\gg1$, the four-band low-energy model Hamiltonian is reduced to a two-band extended Haldane's model, giving rise to a nonzero Chern number $\\mathcal{C}=1$ at either $K$ or $K'$. In the presence of staggered \\emph{AB} sublattice potential $U$, a topological phase transition occurs at $U=M$ from a QAH phase to a quantum valley-Hall phase. We further find that the band gap responses at $K$ and $K'$ are different when $\\lambda_R$, $M$, and $U$ are simultaneously considered. We also show that the QAH phase is robust against weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling $\\lambda_{SO}$, and it transitions a trivial phase when $\\lambda_{SO}>(\\sqrt{M^2+\\lambda^2_R}+M)/2$. Moreover, we use a tight-binding model to reproduce the ab-initio method obtained band structures through doping magnetic atoms on $3\\times3$ and $4\\times4$ supercells of graphene, and explain the physical mechanisms of opening a nontrivial bulk gap to realize the QAH effect in different supercells of graphene."

The hybrid system can take advantage of the strengths of passive radar (e.g., energy efficiency, bi-/multi-static configuration, and spatial diversity) as well as those of active radar (dedicated transmitter, flexible transmit beam steering, waveform optimized for sensing, etc.). To mitigate the mutual interference and location-induced timing uncertainty between the radar and communication signals, we propose two designs for the joint optimization of the radar waveform and receive filters. The first is a max-min (MM) criterion that optimizes a worst-case performance metric over a timing uncertainty interval, and the other a weighted-sum (WS) criterion that forms a weighted sum of the performance metric at each delay within the delay uncertainty interval. Both design criteria result in nonconvex constrained optimization problems that are solved by sequential convex programming methods. When timing uncertainty vanishes, the two designs become identical and admit a simpler solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid schemes in comparison with conventional active-only and passive-only radar systems."

        "Abstract": "The dynamical behavior of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a gas with attractive interactions is striking. Quantum theory predicts that BEC of a spatially homogeneous gas with attractive interactions is precluded by a conventional phase transition into either a liquid or solid. When confined to a trap, however, such a condensate can form provided that its occupation number does not exceed a limiting value. The stability limit is determined by a balance between self-attraction and a repulsion arising from position-momentum uncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near the stability limit, self-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion, causing the condensate to collapse. Growth of the condensate, therefore, is punctuated by intermittent collapses, which are triggered either by macroscopic quantum tunneling or thermal fluctuation. Previous observation of growth and collapse has been hampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms. Here we reduce the stochasticity by controlling the initial number of condensate atoms using a two-photon transition to a diatomic molecular state. This enables us to obtain the first direct observation of the growth of a condensate with attractive interactions and its subsequent collapse."

The basis is the theory of semigroups of linear operators mapping a Banach space $X$ into itself. The rates of approximation play a basic role.   Another tool is a Drazin-like inverse operator $B$ for the infinitesimal generator $A$ of a semigroup that arises naturally in ergodic theory. This operator $B$ is a closed, not necessarily bounded, operator. It was introduced in a paper with U. Westphal (1970/71) and extended to a generalized setting with J. J. Koliha (2009).   The novel open problem concerns the third or Robin's problem of potential theory, the solution of which is not a semigroup of operators. Hence, the semigroup methods applied to Dirichlet's or Neumann's problem cannot be applied. The authors give several hints how to overcome these difficulties."

This gives a complete classification of SEDS VCSPs on three-element domains. The basis of our tractability result is a natural generalisation of the Min-Cut problem, in which only solutions of certain size (given by a lower and upper bound) are permitted.

The model allows a non-parametric estimate of the dependency structure by modelling the auto-covariance function in the spectral domain. All our estimates are made within a Bayesian framework where we use aReversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference. We study the frequentist properties of our estimates via a simulation study, and present a novel way of generating time series data from a nonparametric spectrum.

We offer a new method of identification of neutron star systems using a temperature - luminosity relation. If a given X-ray source is characterized by a low bolometric luminosity and a relatively high color blackbody temperature (>1 kev) it has necessarily to be a neutron star rather than a black hole. From these arguments it is shown that the area of the soft photon source must be small (r ~ 1 km) and that the accretion disk, if present, must be truncated very far from the compact object. Here we report on the possible existence of a cyclotron line around 30 kev. The presence of a neutron star in the system is strongly favored by the available data."

It is shown that if the initial data for an expanding cosmological model of this type is subjected to a small perturbation then the corresponding solution exists globally in the future and the perturbation decays in a way which can be described precisely. It is emphasized that no linearization of the equations or special symmetry assumptions are needed. The result can also be interpreted as a proof of the nonlinear stability of the homogeneous models. In order to prove the theorem we write the general solution as the sum of a homogeneous background and a perturbation. As a by-product of the analysis it is found that there is an invariant sense in which an inhomogeneous model can be regarded as a perturbation of a unique homogeneous model. A method is given for associating uniquely to each Newtonian cosmological model with compact spatial sections a spatially homogeneous model which incorporates its large-scale dynamics. This procedure appears very natural in the Newton-Cartan theory which we take as the starting point for Newtonian cosmology."

To this end we present a new approach based on a concept of the monomer identity breaking and density functional description. We strictly derive, via a proper choice of basic structural units of the gel fraction, all statements usually supposed to be just Flory (Stockmayer) assumptions. A further analysis of the IC structure reveals some new IC structural units (those involved into mesoscopic cycles) overlooked in both Flory and Stockmayer approaches and to be described by a new order parameter characteristic only of the gel phase. As a result, the SGT is found to transform from a geometric phenomenon to a genuine 1st order phase transition always followed by a phase separation into sol and gel phases. The free energy, total conversion, volume fractions of the gel fraction and dangling monomers as well as other structural quantities are calculated as functions of a reduced monomer density and analyzed for all the existing models. The Flory approach is found to be superior to the Stockmayer-Tanaka one and satisfactorily describe some of the dense weak gel properties but fail (even qualitatively) in a quite extended vicinity of the SGT."

        "Abstract": "In this work, we generalize a recursive enumerative formula for connected Feynman diagrams with two external legs. The Feynman diagrams are defined from a fermionic gas with a two-body interaction. The generalized recurrence is valid for connected Feynman diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and an arbitrary order. The recurrence formula terms are expressed in function of weak compositions of non-negative integers and partitions of positive integers in such a way that to each term of the recurrence correspond a partition and a weak composition. The foundation of this enumeration is the Wick theorem, permitting an easy generalization to any quantum field theory. The iterative enumeration is constructive and enables a fast computation of the number of connected Feynman diagrams for a large amount of cases. In particular, the recurrence is solved exactly for two and four external legs, leading to the asymptotic expansion of the number of different connected Feynman diagrams."

        "Abstract": "The prompt emission of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is usually well described by the Band function: two power-laws joined smoothly at a given break energy. In addition to the Band component, a few bursts (GRB941017, GRB090510, GRB090902B and GRB090926A) show clear evidence for a distinct high-energy spectral component, which in some cases evolves independently from the prompt keV component and is well described by a power-law (PL), sometimes with a cut-off energy; this component is found to have long duration, even longer than the burst itself for all the four bursts. Here we report the observation of an anomalous short duration high energy component in GRB980923. GRB980923 is one of the brightest Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) observed by BATSE. Its light curve is characterized by a rapid variability phase lasting ~ 40 s, followed by a smooth emission tail lasting ~ 400 s. A detailed joint analysis of BATSE (LAD and SD) and EGRET TASC data of GRB980923 reveles the presence of an anomalous keV to MeV component in the spectrum that evolves independently from the prompt keV one. This component is well described by a PL with a spectral index of -1.44 and lasts only ~ 2 s; it represents one of the three clearly separated spectral components identified in GRB980923, the other two being the keV prompt emission, well described by the Band function and the tail, well fit by a Smoothly Broken Power Law (SBPL)."

        "Abstract": "We study gravitational lensing with a multiple lens plane approach, proposing a simple analytical model for the probability distribution function (PDF) of the dark matter convergence, kappa, for the different lens planes in a given cosmology as a function of redshift and smoothing angle, theta. The model is fixed solely by the variance of kappa, which in turn is fixed by the amplitude of the power spectrum, sigma_8. We test the PDF against a high resolution Tree-Particle-Mesh simulation and find that it is far superior to the Gaussian or the lognormal, especially for small values of theta << 1 arcmin and at large values of kappa relevant to strong lensing. With this model, we predict the probabilities of strong lensing by a single plane or by multiple planes. We find that for theta ~ 10 arcsec, a single plane accounts for almost all (~ 98%) of the strong lensing cases for source redshift unity. However, for a more typical source redshift of 4, about 12% of the strong lensing cases will result from the contribution of a secondary clump of matter along the line of sight, introducing a systematic error in the determination of the surface density of clusters, typically overestimating it by about 2-5%. We also find that matter inhomogenieties introduce a dispersion in the value of the angular diameter distance about its cosmological mean. The probable error relative to the mean increases with redshift to a value of about 8% for z ~ 6 and theta ~ 10 arcsec."

Not qualifying as a conventional $c\\bar{c}$ state, the multiquark structure of this exotic meson has received very different interpretations, ranging from a compact tetraquark configuration to an extended $D\\bar D^*+c.c.$ molecule. In this work we explore the effect that a hot pion bath may have in the properties of the $X(3872)$, assuming this state to be a $D\\bar D^*+c.c.$ molecule. We derive the finite temperature effects on the $X(3872)$ from a coupled channels unitarized amplitude, obtained including the properties of the charmed mesons under such conditions. We find that the $X(3872)$ develops a subtantial width, of the order of a few tens of MeV, in hot pionic environments at temperatures $100-150$ MeV, and its nominal mass moves above the $D D^*$ threshold. The fact that the $X(3872)$ in a hot pion gas may no longer be a narrow resonance needs to be considered in the estimation of production yields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions."

The broad-band fluxes (U,B,V), and the spectrophotometric optical continuum flux F_lambda(5100 A) monotonically decreased in flux while the broad-band R and I fluxes and the integrated emission-line fluxes of Halpha and Hbeta remained constant to within 5%. On June 22, a short continuum flare was detected in the broad band fluxes. It had an amplitude of about ~18% and it lasted only ~90 min. The broad band fluxes and the optical continuum F_lambda(5100 A) appear to vary simultaneously with the EUV variations. No reliable delay was detected for the broad optical emission lines in response to the EUVE variations. Narrow Hbeta emission features predicted as a signature of an accretion disk were not detected during this campaign. However, there is marginal evidence for a faint feature at lambda = 4962 A with FWHM=~6 A redshifted by Delta v = 1100 km/s with respect to Hbeta_narrow."

        "Abstract": "Researchers illustrate improvements in contextual encoding strategies via resultant performance on a battery of shared Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. Many of these tasks are of a categorical prediction variety: given a conditioning context (e.g., an NLI premise), provide a label based on an associated prompt (e.g., an NLI hypothesis). The categorical nature of these tasks has led to common use of a cross entropy log-loss objective during training. We suggest this loss is intuitively wrong when applied to plausibility tasks, where the prompt by design is neither categorically entailed nor contradictory given the context. Log-loss naturally drives models to assign scores near 0.0 or 1.0, in contrast to our proposed use of a margin-based loss. Following a discussion of our intuition, we describe a confirmation study based on an extreme, synthetically curated task derived from MultiNLI. We find that a margin-based loss leads to a more plausible model of plausibility. Finally, we illustrate improvements on the Choice Of Plausible Alternative (COPA) task through this change in loss."

        "Abstract": "The sub-mm bump observed in the spectrum of Sgr A* appears to indicate the existence of a compact emitting component within several Schwarzschild radii, $r_S$, of the nucleus at the Galactic Center. This is interesting in view of the predicted circularized flow within $\\sim 5-10 r_S$, based on detailed multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of Bondi-Hoyle accretion onto this unusual object. In this paper, we examine the physics of magnetic field generation by a Keplerian dynamo subject to the conditions pertaining to Sgr A*, and show that the sub-mm bump can be produced by thermal synchrotron emission in this inner region. This spectral feature may therefore be taken as indirect evidence for the existence of this circularization. In addition, the self-Comptonization of the sub-mm bump appears to produce an X-ray flux exceeding that due to bremsstrahlung from this region, which may account for the X-ray counterpart to Sgr A* discovered recently by {\\it Chandra}. However, the required accretion rate in the Keplerian flow is orders of magnitude smaller than that predicted by the Bondi-Hoyle simulations. We speculate that rapid evaporation, in the form of a wind, may ensue from the heating associated with turbulent mixing of gas elements with large eccentricity as they settle down into a more or less circular (i.e., low eccentricity) trajectory. The spectrum of Sgr A* longward of $\\sim 1-2$ mm may be generated outside of the Keplerian flow, where the gas is making a transition from a quasi-spherical infall into a circularized pattern."

        "Abstract": "Transfer learning from a high-resource language pair `parent' has been proven to be an effective way to improve neural machine translation quality for low-resource language pairs `children.' However, previous approaches build a custom parent model or at least update an existing parent model's vocabulary for each child language pair they wish to train, in an effort to align parent and child vocabularies. This is not a practical solution. It is wasteful to devote the majority of training time for new language pairs to optimizing parameters on an unrelated data set. Further, this overhead reduces the utility of neural machine translation for deployment in humanitarian assistance scenarios, where extra time to deploy a new language pair can mean the difference between life and death. In this work, we present a `universal' pre-trained neural parent model with constant vocabulary that can be used as a starting point for training practically any new low-resource language to a fixed target language. We demonstrate that our approach, which leverages orthography unification and a broad-coverage approach to subword identification, generalizes well to several languages from a variety of families, and that translation systems built with our approach can be built more quickly than competing methods and with better quality as well."

Guided by a simulator of the target platform, CompactNet progressively trims a pre-trained network by removing certain redundant filters until the target speedup is reached and generates an optimal platform-specific model while maintaining the accuracy. We evaluate our work on two platforms of a mobile ARM CPU and a machine learning accelerator NPU (Cambricon-1A ISA) on a Huawei Mate10 smartphone. For the state-of-the-art slim CNN model made for the embedded platform, MobileNetV2, CompactNet achieves up to a 1.8x kernel computation speedup with equal or even higher accuracy for image classification tasks on the Cifar-10 dataset."

We consider a renewable energy generation process that fully charges the RB at random time instants, and its realization is assumed to be known also by the UP. We reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solve it by dynamic programming (DP) to design battery charging and discharging policies that minimize a linear combination of the privacy leakage and energy cost. We also propose a lower bound and two alternative low-complexity energy management policies, one of which is shown numerically to perform close to the MDP solution."

Based on a principled decomposition of the ego-network, each representation encodes the role of the node in a different local community in which the nodes participate. These representations allow for improved reconstruction of the nuanced relationships that occur in the graph -- a phenomenon that we illustrate through state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks on a variety of graphs, reducing the error by up to $90\\%$. In addition, we show that these embeddings allow for effective visual analysis of the learned community structure."

Although not strictly applicable to this material due to its low energy barrier $J$ that leads to a quantum paraelastic phase, the present exercise is relevant as it establishes a conceptual procedure to estimate such moduli straight from a two-dimensional elastic energy landscape. As additional support for the existence of a quantum paraelastic phase, we carry a qualitative WKB analysis to estimate escape times from an individual well on the landscape; escape times increase exponentially with the height of the barrier $J$. We also provide arguments against an additional transformation onto a planar lattice due to its high energy cost. These results continue to establish a case for the usefulness of soft matter concepts in two-dimensional materials, and of the potential lurking of quantum effects into soft matter."

It is shown that if the initial data for an expanding cosmological model of this type is subjected to a small perturbation then the corresponding solution exists globally in the future and the perturbation decays in a way which can be described precisely. It is emphasized that no linearization of the equations or special symmetry assumptions are needed. The result can also be interpreted as a proof of the nonlinear stability of the homogeneous models. In order to prove the theorem we write the general solution as the sum of a homogeneous background and a perturbation. As a by-product of the analysis it is found that there is an invariant sense in which an inhomogeneous model can be regarded as a perturbation of a unique homogeneous model. A method is given for associating uniquely to each Newtonian cosmological model with compact spatial sections a spatially homogeneous model which incorporates its large-scale dynamics. This procedure appears very natural in the Newton-Cartan theory which we take as the starting point for Newtonian cosmology."

        "Abstract": "Quantum metrology uses quantum states with no classical counterpart to measure a physical quantity with extraordinary sensitivity or precision. Most metrology schemes measure a single parameter of a dynamical process by probing it with a specially designed quantum state. The success of such a scheme usually relies on the process belonging to a particular one-parameter family. If this assumption is violated, or if the goal is to measure more than one parameter, a different quantum state may perform better. In the most extreme case, we know nothing about the process and wish to learn everything. This requires quantum process tomography, which demands an informationally-complete set of probe states. It is very convenient if this set is group-covariant -- i.e., each element is generated by applying an element of the quantum system's natural symmetry group to a single fixed fiducial state. In this paper, we consider metrology with 2-photon (\"biphoton\") states, and report experimental studies of different states' sensitivity to small, unknown collective SU(2) rotations (\"SU(2) jitter\"). Maximally entangled N00N states are the most sensitive detectors of such a rotation, yet they are also among the worst at fully characterizing an a-priori unknown process. We identify (and confirm experimentally) the best SU(2)-covariant set for process tomography; these states are all less entangled than the N00N state, and are characterized by the fact that they form a 2-design."

The approach is based on an analysis of the classical limit of quantum-mechanical problems. Initially, we study the classical problem within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics and derive a fully self-consistent theory of large amplitude collective motion with small velocities. We derive a measure for the quality of decoupling of the collective degree of freedom. We show for several simple examples, where the classical limit is obvious, that when decoupling is good, a quantization of the collective Hamiltonian leads to accurate descriptions of the low energy properties of the systems studied. In nuclear physics problems we construct the classical Hamiltonian by means of time-dependent mean-field theory, and we transcribe our formalism to this case. We report studies of a model for monopole vibrations, of $^{28}$Si with a realistic interaction, several qualitative models of heavier nuclei, and preliminary results for a more realistic approach to heavy nuclei. Other topics included are a nuclear Born-Oppenheimer approximation for an {\\em ab initio} quantum theory and a theory of the transfer of energy between collective and non-collective degrees of freedom when the decoupling is not exact.

This is analogous to the solution path from the usual Lasso ($\\ell_1$-regularized) linear regression. We call the proposed procedure \"LassoNet\" and develop a projected proximal gradient algorithm for its optimization. This approach can sometimes give as low or lower test error than a standard neural network, and its feature selection provides more interpretable solutions.

An extensive set of echoes (84 800) from four different foliages was transcribed into a spike code using a parsimonious model (linear filtering, half-wave rectification, thresholding). The spike code is assumed to consist of time differences (interspike intervals) between threshold crossings. Among the elementary interspike intervals flanked by exceedances of adjacent thresholds, a few intervals triggered by disjoint half-cycles of the carrier oscillation stand out in terms of resolvability, visibility across resolution scales and a simple stochastic structure (uncorrelatedness). They are therefore argued to be a stochastic analogue to edges in vision. A three-dimensional feature vector representing these interspike intervals sustained a reliable target classification performance (0.06% classification error) in a sequential probability ratio test, which models sequential processing of echo trains by biological sonar systems. The dimensions of the representation are the first moments of duration and amplitude location of these interspike intervals as well as their number. All three quantities are readily reconciled with known principles of neural signal representation, since they correspond to the center of gravity of excitation on a neural map and the total amount of excitation."

Stability with respect to gauge perturbations depends on a choice of gauge and a background metric, but it does not depend on a particular form of a 3+1 system if its constrained solutions are equivalent to those of the Einstein equations. Stability of a number of known gauges is investigated in the limit of short-wavelength perturbations. All fixed gauges except a synchronous gauge are found to be ill-posed. A maximal slicing gauge and its parabolic extension are shown to be ill-posed as well. A necessary condition is derived for well-posedness of metric-dependent algebraic gauges. Well-posed metric-dependent gauges are found, however, to be generally unstable. Both instability and ill-posedness are associated with perturbations of physical accelerations of reference frames."

A striking result is a common mean observed radio luminosity from the black hole candidates (BHCs) in the Low/Hard X-ray state and the neutron-star Z sources on the horizontal X-ray branch. This implies a common mean intrinsic radio luminosity to within a factor of twenty five (or less, if there is significant Doppler boosting of the radio emission). Unless coincidental, these results imply a physical mechanism for jet formation which requires neither a black hole event horizon or a neutron star surface. As a whole the populations of Atoll and X-ray pulsar systems are less luminous by factors of >5 and >10 at radio wavelengths than the BHCs and Z sources (while some Atoll sources have been detected, no high-field X-ray pulsar has ever been reliably detected as a radio source). We suggest that all of the persistent BHCs and the Z sources generate, at least sporadically, an outflow with physical dimensions > 1e12cm, i.e. significantly larger than the binary separations of most of the systems. We compare the physical conditions of accretion in each of the types of persistent X-ray binary and conclude that a relatively low (<1e10 G) magnetic field associated with the accreting object, and a high (>0.1 Eddington) accretion rate and/or dramatic physical change in the accretion flow, are required for formation of a radio-emitting outflow or jet."

Sgr A*, the resident SMBH of the Milky Way, produces (by comparison) tiny flares that last only hours but occur daily. Here we explore the possibility that these flares could be produced by disruption of smaller bodies - asteroids. We show that asteroids passing within an AU of Sgr A* could be split into smaller fragments which then vaporise by bodily friction with the tenuous quiescent gas accretion flow onto Sgr A*. The ensuing shocks and plasma instabilities may create a transient population of very hot electrons invoked in several currently popular models for Sgr A* flares, thus producing the required spectra. We estimate that asteroids larger than ~ 10 km in size are needed to power the observed flares, with the maximum possible luminosity of the order 10^39 erg s^-1. Assuming that the asteroid population per parent star in the central parsec of the Milky Way is not too dissimilar from that around stars in the Solar neighbourhood, we estimate the asteroid disruption rates, and the distribution of the expected luminosities, finding a reasonable agreement with the observations. We also note that planets may be tidally disrupted by Sgr A* as well, also very infrequently. We speculate that one such disruption may explain the putative increase in Sgr A* luminosity ~ 300 yr ago."

        "Abstract": "Let g be a Lie algebra over a field F of characteristic zero, let C be a certain tensor category of representations of g, and C-du a certain category of duals. By a Tannaka reconstruction we associate to C and C-du a monoid M with coordinate ring of matrix coefficients F[M], (which has in general no natural coalgebra structure), as well as a Lie algebra Lie(M). We interprete the monoid M algebraic geometrically as a weak algebraic monoid with Lie algebra Lie(M). The monoid M acts by morphisms of varieties on every object of C, the Lie algebra Lie(M) acts by the differentiated action.   If g is in a natural way a subalgebra of Lie(M), we say that C and C-du are good for integrating g. In this situation we treat: The adjoint action of the unit group of M on Lie(M). The relation between g and M-invariant subspaces. The embedding of F[M] in the dual of the universal enveloping algebra of g. A Peter-and-Weyl-type theorem if the category C is semisimple. The Jordan-Chevalley decompositions for certain elements of M and Lie(M). An embedding theorem related to subalgebras of g which act locally finite. Prounipotent subgroups of M, and generalized toric submonoids of M. We show that C and C-du are good for integrating g, if the Lie algebra g is generated by integrable locally finite elements."

        "Abstract": "We have analyzed a Chandra HETGS spectrum of the Galactic black hole Cygnus X-1, obtained at a source flux which is approximately twice that commonly observed in its persistent low-intensity, spectrally-hard state. We find a myriad of absorption lines in the spectrum, including Ly-alpha lines and helium-like resonance lines from Ne, Na, Mg, and Si. We calculate a flux-weighted mean red-shift of ~100 km/s and a flux-weighted mean velocity width of 800 km/s (FWHM) for lines from these elements. We also detect a number of transitions from Fe XVIII-XXIV and Ni XIX-XX in absorption; however, the identification of these lines is less certain and a greater range of shifts and breadth is measured. Our observation occurred at a binary phase of phi = 0.76; the lines observed are consistent with absorption in an ionized region of the supergiant O9.7 Iab companion wind. The spectrum is extremely complicated in that a range of temperatures and densities are implied. Prior Chandra HETGS spectra of Cygnus X-1 were obtained in a similar transition state (at phi = 0.93) and in the low/hard state (at phi= 0.84). Considered together, these spectra provide evidence for a companion wind that is focused as it flows onto the black hole primary in this system."

        "Title": "Learning Conditional Deformable Templates with Convolutional Networks",
        "Abstract": "We develop a learning framework for building deformable templates, which play a fundamental role in many image analysis and computational anatomy tasks. Conventional methods for template creation and image alignment to the template have undergone decades of rich technical development. In these frameworks, templates are constructed using an iterative process of template estimation and alignment, which is often computationally very expensive. Due in part to this shortcoming, most methods compute a single template for the entire population of images, or a few templates for specific sub-groups of the data. In this work, we present a probabilistic model and efficient learning strategy that yields either universal or conditional templates, jointly with a neural network that provides efficient alignment of the images to these templates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on a variety of domains, with a special focus on neuroimaging. This is particularly useful for clinical applications where a pre-existing template does not exist, or creating a new one with traditional methods can be prohibitively expensive. Our code and atlases are available online as part of the VoxelMorph library at http://voxelmorph.csail.mit.edu."

        "Abstract": "A matrix method is formulated in a Lagrangian representation for the solution of the characteristic value problem governing modes of oscillation and instability in a collisionless stellar system. The underlying perturbation equations govern the Lagrangian displacement of a star in the six-dimensional phase space. This matrix method has a basis in a variational principle. The method is developed in detail for radial oscillations of a spherical system. The basis vectors required for the representation of the Lagrangian displacement in this case are derived from solutions of the Lagrangian perturbation equations for radial perturbations in a homogeneous sphere. The basis vectors are made divergence free in the six-dimensional phase space in accordance with the requirement of Liouville's theorem that the flow of the system in the phase space must be incompressible. The basis vectors are made orthogonal with respect to a properly chosen set of adjoint vectors with the aid of a Gram-Schmidt procedure. Some basis vectors are null vectors in the sense that their inner products with their own adjoint vectors vanish. The characteristic frequencies of the lowest radial modes are calculated in several approximations for members of a family of spherical models which span a wide range of central concentrations. The present formulation of the matrix method can be generalized for nonradial modes in spherical systems and for modes in axisymmetric systems."

The results include both deterministic and randomized upper and lower bounds, and demonstrate a separation between the two settings for a number of problems. The depth of a comparator network is a straight-forward upper bound on the worst case fragile complexity of the corresponding fragile algorithm. We prove that fragile complexity is a different and strictly easier property than the depth of comparator networks, in the sense that for some problems a fragile complexity equal to the best network depth can be achieved with less total work and that with randomization, even a lower fragile complexity is possible."

        "Abstract": "Stochastic mirror descent (SMD) is a fairly new family of algorithms that has recently found a wide range of applications in optimization, machine learning, and control. It can be considered a generalization of the classical stochastic gradient algorithm (SGD), where instead of updating the weight vector along the negative direction of the stochastic gradient, the update is performed in a \"mirror domain\" defined by the gradient of a (strictly convex) potential function. This potential function, and the mirror domain it yields, provides considerable flexibility in the algorithm compared to SGD. While many properties of SMD have already been obtained in the literature, in this paper we exhibit a new interpretation of SMD, namely that it is a risk-sensitive optimal estimator when the unknown weight vector and additive noise are non-Gaussian and belong to the exponential family of distributions. The analysis also suggests a modified version of SMD, which we refer to as symmetric SMD (SSMD). The proofs rely on some simple properties of Bregman divergence, which allow us to extend results from quadratics and Gaussians to certain convex functions and exponential families in a rather seamless way."

We use a Newtonian three-dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, and model the neutron star with a soft (adiabatic index Gamma=5/3) polytropic equation of state and the black hole as a Newtonian point mass which accretes matter via an absorbing boundary at the Schwarzschild radius. Our initial conditions correspond to tidally locked binaries in equilibrium, and we have explored configurations with different values of the mass ratio q=Mns/Mbh, ranging from q=1 to q=0.1. The dynamical evolution is followed for approximately 23 ms, and in every case studied here we find that the neutron star is tidally disrupted on a dynamical timescale, forming a dense torus around the black hole that contains a few tenths of a solar mass. A nearly baryon-free axis is present in the system throughout the coalescence, and only modest beaming of a fireball that could give rise to a gamma-ray burst would be sufficient to avoid excessive baryon contamination. We find that some mass (on the order of 0.01 to 0.001 solar masses) may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could thus contribute substantially to the amount of observed r-process material in the galaxy. We calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms and luminosity in the quadrupole approximation."

This model considers that tumor-induced alteration of microenvironmental pH provides a mechanism for cancer invasion. A coupled system reaction-diffusion describing this model is given by three partial differential equations for the 2D non-dimensional spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the density of normal tissue, the neoplastic tissue growth and the excess concentration of H+ ions. Each of the model parameters has a corresponding biological interpretation, for instance, the growth rate of neoplastic tissue, the diffusion coefficient, the re-absorption rate and the destructive influence of H+ ions in the healthy tissue. After solving the direct problem, we propose a model for the estimation of parameters by fitting the numerical solution with real data, obtained via in vitro experiments and fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy. We define an appropriate functional to compare both the real data and the numerical solution using the adjoint method for the minimization of this functional. We apply a splitting strategy joint with Adaptive Finite Element Method (AFEM) to solve the direct problem and the adjoint problem. The minimization problem (the inverse problem) is solved by using a trust-region-reflective method including the computation of the derivative of the functional."

        "Abstract": "Electrophoretic separation of a mixture of chemical species is a fundamental technique of great usefulness in biology, health care and forensics. In capillary electrophoresis the sample migrates in a microcapillary in the presence of a background electrolyte. When the ionic concentration of the sample is sufficiently high, the signal is known to exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear waves including sharp concentration `shocks'.In this paper we consider a simplified model consisting of a single sample ion and a background electrolyte consisting of a single co-ion and a counterion in the absence of any processes that might change the ionization states of the constituents. If the ionic diffusivities are assumed to be the same for all constituents the concentration of sample ion is shown to obey a one dimensional advection diffusion equation with a concentration dependent advection velocity.If the analyte concentration is sufficiently low in a suitable non-dimensional sense, Burgers' equation is recovered, and thus, the time dependent problem is exactly solvable with arbitrary initial conditions. In the case of small diffusivity either a leading edge or trailing edge shock is formed depending on the electrophoretic mobility of the sample ion relative to the background ions. Analytical formulas are presented for the shape, width and migration velocity of the sample peak and it is shown that axial dispersion at long times may be characterized by an effective diffusivity that is exactly calculated. These results are consistent with known observations from physical and numerical simulation experiments."

Here we consider \"local\" biasing models, in which the galaxy density field $\\delta_g$ at a point is a function of the matter density field $\\delta$ at that point: $\\delta_g = f(\\delta)$. We consider both deterministic biasing, where $f$ is simply a function, and stochastic biasing, in which the galaxy density is a random variable whose distribution depends on the matter density: $\\delta_g=X(\\delta)$. We show that even when this mapping is performed on a highly nonlinear density field with a hierarchical correlation structure, the correlation function $\\xi$ is simply scaled up by a constant, as long as $\\xi << 1$. In stochastic biasing models, the galaxy autocorrelation function behaves exactly as in deterministic models, with the mean value of $X$ for a given value of $\\delta$ taking the role of the deterministic bias function. We extend our results to the power spectrum P(k), showing that for sufficiently small k, the effect of local biasing is equivalent to the multiplication of P(k) by a constant, with the addition of a constant term. If a cosmological model predicts a large-scale mass correlation function in conflict with the shape of the observed galaxy correlation function, then the model cannot be rescued by appealing to a complicated but local relation between galaxies and mass."

The mean IMF multiplicities (for the events with at least one IMF) are saturating at the value of $2.2\\pm0.2$ for the incident energies above 6 GeV. The observed IMF multiplicities cannot be described in a two-stage scenario, a fast cascade followed by a statistical multifragmentation. Agreement with the measured IMF multiplicities is obtained by introducing an intermediate phase and modifying empirically the excitation energies and masses of the remnants.   The angular distributions and energy spectra from the p-induced collisions are in agreement with the scenario of ``thermal'' multifragmentation of a hot and diluted target spectator. In the case of $^{12}$C+Au(22.4 GeV) and $^4$He(14.6 GeV)+Au collisions, deviations from a pure thermal break-up are seen in the energy spectra of the emitted fragments, which are harder than those both from model calculations and from the measured ones for p-induced collisions.

This is, however, only an optical analogue of a quantum system, and it would be highly desirable to observe the manifestation of PT symmetry and the resulting properties also in a real, experimentally accessible, quantum system. Following a suggestion by Klaiman et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 080402, 2008), we investigate a PT symmetric arrangement of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double well potential, where in one well cold atoms are injected while in the other particles are extracted from the condensate. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the nonlinearity in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on the PT properties of the condensate. To study these effects we analyze a simple one-dimensional model system in which the condensate is placed into two PT symmetric delta-function traps. The analysis will serve as a useful guide for studies of the behaviour of Bose-Einstein condensates in realistic PT symmetric double wells."

The dark matter field, which makes up a defect, may interact with standard model particles, including quarks and the photon, resulting in the alteration of their masses. When a topological defect passes through a pulsar, its mass, radius and internal structure may be altered, resulting in a pulsar `quake'. A topological defect may also function as a cosmic dielectric material with a distinctive frequency-dependent index of refraction, which would give rise to the time delay of a periodic extraterrestrial light or radio signal, and the dispersion of a light or radio source in a manner distinct to a gravitational lens. A topological defect passing through Earth may give rise to temporary non-zero electric dipole moments for an electron, proton, neutron, nuclei and atoms. The biggest advantage of such astrophysical observations over recently proposed terrestrial detection methods is the much higher probability of a defect been found in the vast volumes of outer space compared with one passing through Earth itself."

        "Abstract": "Quantum metrology uses quantum states with no classical counterpart to measure a physical quantity with extraordinary sensitivity or precision. Most metrology schemes measure a single parameter of a dynamical process by probing it with a specially designed quantum state. The success of such a scheme usually relies on the process belonging to a particular one-parameter family. If this assumption is violated, or if the goal is to measure more than one parameter, a different quantum state may perform better. In the most extreme case, we know nothing about the process and wish to learn everything. This requires quantum process tomography, which demands an informationally-complete set of probe states. It is very convenient if this set is group-covariant -- i.e., each element is generated by applying an element of the quantum system's natural symmetry group to a single fixed fiducial state. In this paper, we consider metrology with 2-photon (\"biphoton\") states, and report experimental studies of different states' sensitivity to small, unknown collective SU(2) rotations (\"SU(2) jitter\"). Maximally entangled N00N states are the most sensitive detectors of such a rotation, yet they are also among the worst at fully characterizing an a-priori unknown process. We identify (and confirm experimentally) the best SU(2)-covariant set for process tomography; these states are all less entangled than the N00N state, and are characterized by the fact that they form a 2-design."

The relative weight between reaction and relocation is gauged by a scalar control parameter, which can be adjusted at will. Different equilibria are attained by the system, following the externally imposed modulation, and reflecting the interplay between reaction and diffusion terms. The information gathered on the observation node is used to predict the stationary density as displayed by the system, via a direct implementation of the celebrated Heterogeneous Mean Field (HMF) approximation. This knowledge translates into a linear problem which can be solved to return the entries of the sought distribution. A variant of the model is then considered which consists in assuming a localized source where the reactive constituents are injected, at a rate that can be adjusted as a stepwise function of time. The linear problem obtained when operating in this setting allows one to recover a fair estimate of the underlying system size. Numerical experiments are carried so as to challenge the predictive ability of the theory."

The main result of this paper is a lower-bound (in general sharp) for the dimensions of the spaces spanned in each degree by the partial derivatives of the forms generating $W$, in terms of the dimensions of the spaces spanned by the partial derivatives of the forms generating the original space $V$. Rephrasing our result in the language of commutative algebra (where this result finds its most important applications), we have: let $A$ be a type $t$ artinian level algebra with $h$-vector $h=(1,h_1,h_2,...,h_e)$, and let, for $c=1,2,...,t-1$, $H^{c,gen}=(1,H_1^{c,gen},H_2^{c,gen},...,H_e^{c,gen})$ be the $h$-vector of the generic type $c$ level quotient of $A$ having the same socle degree $e$. Then we supply a lower-bound (in general sharp) for the $h$-vector $H^{c,gen}$. Explicitly, we will show that, for any $u\\in \\lbrace 1,...,e\\rbrace $, $$H_u^{c,gen}\\geq {1\\over t^2-1}((t-c)h_{e-u}+(ct-1)h_u).$$ This result generalizes a recent theorem of Iarrobino (which treats the case $t=2$). Finally, we begin to obtain, as a consequence, some structure theorems for level $h$-vectors of type bigger than 2, which is, at this time, a very little explored topic."

The fibril is approximated by a thin magnetic flux tube which evolves dynamically in the environment given by the global magnetostatic model of a sunspot.   Our simulation shows that the flux tube, initially positioned at the penumbra--quiet Sun boundary in the model, will rise through its deep penumbra developing a flow along the tube that points upward beneath the photosphere, and radially outward above the photosphere. Our results suggest that a bright filament may be formed by an extended tail of a penumbral grain. Such filaments are optically thick, hotter than the surroundings, and elevated above a darker background. An upflow in penumbral grains bends horizontally outwards above the photosphere and gradually cools down due to radiative losses leading to a tail that gradually darkens. The plasma flow inside the flux tube then becomes transparent and the tube constitutes a thin elevated flow channel, that can reproduce the observed features of the Evershed effect. We present also a new acceleration mechanism for the Evershed flow. It is demonstrated that a local surplus of gas pressure develops inside the tube as it rises through the specific (superadiabatic and magnetized) penumbral background. The resulting gradient of the gas pressure can drive the flow along the tube."

This paper is a more systematic investigation of C*-algebras with the APFP. We prove various properties of such algebras. For example: They have connected invertible group, trivial K_1, and stable rank 1. In the unital case, the K_0 group separates the tracial states. The APFP passes to matrix algebras. and if I is an ideal in A such that I and A/I have the APFP, then so does A. We also give some new examples of C*-algebras with the APFP, including type II_1 factors and infinite-dimensional simple unital direct limits with slow dimension growth, real rank zero, and trivial K_1 group. An infinite- dimensional simple unital direct limit with slow dimension growth and with the APFP must have real rank zero, but we also give examples of unital algebras with the APFP which do not have real rank zero.

When agents are non-strategic, an agent's strategy is known to the other agents. Nevertheless, the agents' strategy choices and beliefs are interdependent over times, a phenomenon known as signaling. We introduce the notions of private information that effectively compresses the agents' information in a mutually consistent manner. Based on the notions of sufficient information, we propose an information state for each agent that is sufficient for decision making purposes. We present instances of dynamic multi-agent decision problems where we can determine an information state with a time-invariant domain for each agent. Furthermore, we present a generalization of the policy-independence property of belief in Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to dynamic multi-agent decision problems. Within the context of dynamic teams with asymmetric information, the proposed set of information states leads to a sequential decomposition that decouples the interdependence between the agents' strategies and beliefs over time, and enables us to formulate a dynamic program to determine a globally optimal policy via backward induction."

Unlike the standard lensing map, the Jacobian matrix of a wavefront lensing map is not symmetric. Our formulas are then applied to caustic ``surfing.'' By surfing a caustic surface, a space-borne telescope can be fixed on a gravitationally lensed source to obtain an observation of the source at very high magnification over an extended time period, revealing structure about the source that could not otherwise be resolved. Using our analytical expressions for caustic sheets, we present a scheme for surfing a caustic sheet of a lensed source in rectilinear motion. Detailed illustrations are also presented of the possible types of wavefronts and caustic sheets due to nonsingular and singular elliptical potentials, and singular isothermal spheres, including an example of caustic surfing for a singular elliptical potential lens."

        "Abstract": "We present a hydrodynamical study of the final stages of inspiral in a black hole-neutron star (NS) binary. We use a Newtonian 3D SPH code, and model the NS with a stiff (index G=3 and G=2.5) polytropic equation of state and the black hole as a Newtonian point mass. Our initial conditions correspond to irrotational binaries in equilibrium (approximating the NS as a compressible ellipsoid), and we have explored configurations with different initial mass ratios, 0.2< q=M_ns/M_bh<0.5. The dynamical evolution is followed for ~23ms. We include gravitational radiation losses in the quadrupole approximation for a point-mass binary. For G=3, after an initial episode of mass transfer, the NS is not completely disrupted and a remnant core remains in orbit about the black hole. For G=2.5 the disruption is more complex, with the NS being totally disrupted during a second periastron passage. The accretion disc formed around the black hole contains ~0.2 solar masses. A nearly baryon-free axis is always present in the system, and only modest beaming of a relativistic fireball that could give rise to a GRB would be sufficient to avoid baryon contamination. Around 0.01 solar masses may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could contribute substantially to the amount of observed galactic r-process material. We calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms in the quadrupole approximation. We also present the results of simulations that have used spherical NSs relaxed in isolation as initial conditions, in order to gauge the effect of using non-equilibrium initial conditions on the coalescence."

        "Title": "Drinfel'd algebra deformations, homotopy comodules and the associahedra",
        "Abstract": "The aim of this work is to construct a cohomology theory controlling the deformations of a general Drinfel'd algebra. The task is accomplished in three steps. The first step is the construction of a modified cobar complex adapted to a non-coassociative comultiplication. The following two steps each involve a new, highly non-trivial, construction. The first construction, essentially combinatorial, defines a differential graded Lie algebra structure on the simplicial chain complex of the associahedra. The second construction, of a more algebraic nature, is the definition of map of differential graded Lie algebras from the complex defined above to the algebra of derivations on the bar resolution. Using the existence of this map and the acyclicity of the associahedra we can define a so-called homotopy comodule structure on the bar resolution of a general Drinfeld algebra. This in turn allows us to define the desired cohomology theory in terms of a complex which consists, roughly speaking, of the bimodule and bicomodule maps from the bar resolution to the modified cobar resolution. The complex is bigraded but not a bicomplex as in the Gerstenhaber-Schack theory for bialgebra deformations. The new components of the coboundary operator are defined via the constructions mentioned above. As an application we show that the Drinfel'd deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of a simple Lie algebra is not a jump deformation. The results of the paper were announced in the paper \"Drinfel'd algebra deformations and the associahedra\" (IMRN, Duke Math. Journal, 4(1994), 169-176, appeared also as preprint hep-th/9312196)."

The analysis is performed by investigating the bipartite network of banks and firms which is obtained by setting a link between a bank and a firm when a credit relationship is present in a given time window. In our investigation we focus on a community detection algorithm which is identifying communities composed by both banks and firms. We show that the clusters obtained by directly working on the bipartite network carry information about the networked nature of the Japanese credit market. Our analysis is performed for each calendar year during the time period from 1980 to 2011. Specifically, we obtain communities of banks and networks for each of the 32 investigated years, and we introduce a method to track the time evolution of these communities on a statistical basis. We then characterize communities by detecting the simultaneous over-expression of attributes of firms and banks. Specifically, we consider as attributes the economic sector and the geographical location of firms and the type of banks. In our 32 year long analysis we detect a persistence of the over-expression of attributes of clusters of banks and firms together with a slow dynamics of changes from some specific attributes to new ones. Our empirical observations show that the credit market in Japan is a networked market where the type of banks, geographical location of firms and banks and economic sector of the firm play a role in shaping the credit relationships between banks and firms."

No guidelines were offered before the first draft, if not to reach a minimum of words to justify a separate section/contribution. Afterwards, all authors read and commented on each other's work and minimal editing was done. Every author was asked to suggest open questions and future perspectives on the topic of crypto art from their vantage point, while keeping full control of their own sections at all times. While this process does not necessarily guarantee the uniformity expected from, say, a research article, it allows for multiple voices to emerge and provide for a contribution on a common topic. The ending section offers an attempt to pull all these threads together into a perspective on the future of crypto art."

        "Abstract": "Sorting and hashing are two completely different concepts in computer science, and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory, and is used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement, and is a common activity performed frequently in a variety of applications.   Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison, and in doing so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity. Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative method for ordering the data than comparison, to exceed the linearithmic time complexity boundary on algorithmic performance.   The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by hashing, which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional sorting algorithm, the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time complexity factor -- even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting."

        "Abstract": "We detected a new AM Her star serendipitously in a 25 day observation with the EUVE satellite. A coherent period of 85.82 min is present in the EUVE Deep Survey imager light curve of this source. A spectroscopic identification is made with a 19th magnitude blue star that has H and He emission lines, and broad cyclotron humps typical of a magnetic cataclysmic variable. A lower limit to the polar magnetic field of 46 MG is estimated from the spacing of the cyclotron harmonics. EUVE J0425.6-5714 is also detected in archival ROSAT HRI observations spanning two months, and its stable and highly structured light curve permits us to fit a coherent ephemeris linking the ROSAT and EUVE data over a 1.3 yr gap. The derived period is 85.82107 +/- 0.00020 min, and the ephemeris should be accurate to 0.1 cycles until the year 2005. A narrow but partial X-ray eclipse suggests that this object belongs to the group of Am Her stars whose viewing geometry is such that the accretion stream periodically occults the soft X-ray emitting accretion spot on the surface of the white dwarf. A non-detection of hard X-rays from ASCA observations that are contemporaneous with the ROSAT HRI shows that the soft X-rays must dominate by at least an order of magnitude, which is consistent with a known trend among AM Her stars with large magnetic field. This object should not be confused with the Seyfert galaxy 1H 0419-577 (= LB 1727), another X-ray/EUV source which lies only 4' away, and was the principal target of these monitoring observations."

To this end, we developed a new method to optimize the ReaxFF parameters based on a machine learning approach. This approach combines the $k$-nearest neighbor and random forest regressor algorithm to efficiently locate several possible ReaxFF parameter sets, thereby the optimized ReaxFF parameter can predict physical properties even in a high-temperature condition within a small effort of parameter refinement. As a pilot test of the developed approach, the optimized ReaxFF parameter set was applied to perform chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of an $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ crystal. The crystal structure of $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ was reasonably reproduced even at a relatively high temperature (2000 K). The reactive MD simulation suggests that the (11$\\overline{2}$0) surface grows faster than the (0001) surface, indicating that the developed parameter optimization technique could be used for understanding the chemical reaction in the CVD process."

        "Abstract": "We present results from two XMM-Newton observations of the bright classical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582 taken four years apart (2001 May and 2005 April). We present the analysis of the high-resolution (0.3-1 keV) RGS and low-resolution (0.3-10 keV) EPIC spectroscopic data. A comparison with a 1998 BeppoSAX observation suggests that XMM-Newton caught the source in a `reflection-dominated' phase, measuring the lowest continuum flux level ever (F(2-10 keV) = 2.3 x 10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1) in 2005. NGC 7582 therefore experienced a dramatic spectral transition most likely due to the partial switching-off of the nuclear activity. The XMM-Newton spectrum of the continuum emission is very complex. It can be well described by a model consisting of a combination of a heavily absorbed (Nh ~ 10^(24) cm^-2) power law and a pure reflection component both obscured by a column density of ~ 4 x 10^(22) cm^-2. Notably, we detect a significant increase by a factor of ~2 in the column density of the inner, thicker absorber covering the primary X-ray source between 2001 and 2005. The 2005 XMM-Newton spectra show the strongest Fe Kalpha emission line ever measured in this source. This is consistent with the line delayed time response to the decrease of the nuclear activity. Our analysis also reveals that the soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines from highly ionized metals. The detection of a narrow OVIII radiative recombination continuum suggests an origin in a photoionized plasma."

        "Abstract": "Recently Perlmutter et al. suggested a positive value of Einstein's cosmological constant Lambda on the basis of luminosity distances from type-Ia supernovae. However, Lambda world models had earlier been proposed by Hoell & Priester and Liebscher et al. on the basis of quasar absorption-line data. Employing more general repulsive fluids (\"dark energy\") encompassing the Lambda component we quantitatively compare both approaches with each other.   Fitting the SN-data by a minimum-component model consisting of dark energy + dust yields a closed universe with a large amount of dust exceeding the baryonic content constrained by big-bang nucleosynthesis. The nature of the dark energy is hardly constrained. Only when enforcing a flat universe there is a clear tendency to a dark-energy Lambda fluid and the `canonical' value Omega_M = 0.3 for dust.   Conversely, fitting the quasar-data by a minimum-component model yields a sharply defined, slightly closed model with a low dust density ruling out significant pressureless dark matter. The dark-energy component obtains an equation-of-state P = -0.96 epsilon close to that of a Lambda-fluid. Omega_M = 0.3 or a precisely flat spatial geometry are inconsistent with minimum-component models.   It is found that quasar and supernova data sets cannot be reconciled with each other via (repulsive ideal fluid+dust+radiation)-world models. Compatibility could be reached by drastic expansion of the parameter space with at least two exotic fluids added to dust and radiation as world constituents. If considering such solutions as far-fetched one has to conclude that the quasar absorption line and the SN-Ia constraints are incompatible."

All modeling assumptions are rigorously explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation. This approach results in a transparent and intuitive model. With respect to the state of the art beam model this paper: (i) proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects, (ii) intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art beam model, and (iii) reduces the number of model parameters, while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data. The proposed beam model is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum likelihood and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization) are proposed to learn the model parameters.   Furthermore, the RBBM is extended to a full scan model in two steps: first, to a full scan model for static environments and next, to a full scan model for general, dynamic environments. The full scan model accounts for the dependency between beams and adapts to the local sample density when using a particle filter. In contrast to Gaussian-based state of the art models, the proposed full scan model uses a sample-based approximation. This sample-based approximation enables handling dynamic environments and capturing multi-modality, which occurs even in simple static environments."

Here we used a Self Organized Map (SOM)-based, fully automatic and unsupervised, classification procedure described in our earlier work and applied it to sets of minimally processed grayscale and/or color processed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of CD4+ T-lymphocytes (so-called helper cells) with varying extent of HIV virion infection. It is shown that the quantization error in the SOM output after training permits to scale the spatial magnitude and the direction of change (+ or -) in local pixel contrast or color across images of a series with a reliability that exceeds that of any human expert. The procedure is easily implemented and fast, and represents a promising step towards low-cost automatic digital image archiving with minimal intervention of a human operator."

Our approach utilizes the fact that a network modelled from a single non-interacting Gaussian chain of macroscopic size can be solved exactly, even for randomly distributed crosslinking junctions. We derive an {\\it exact} expression for the partition function of such a generalized Gaussian structure in the presence of random external fields and for its scattering function $S_0$. We show that $S_0$ of a randomly crosslinked Gaussian network (RCGN) is a self-averaging quantity and depends only on crosslink concentration $M/N$, where $M$ and $N$ are the total numbers of crosslinks and monomers. From our derivation we find that the radius of gyration $R_{\\mbox{\\tiny g}}$ of a RCGN is of the universal form $R_{\\mbox{\\tiny g}}^2=(0.26 \\pm 0.01)a^2 N/M$, with $a$ being the Kuhn length. To treat the excluded volume effect in a systematic, perturbative manner, we expand the Deam-Edwards partition function in terms of density fluctuations analogous to the theory of linear polymers. For a highly crosslinked interacting network we derive an expression for the free energy of the system in terms of $S_0$ which has the same role in our model as the Debye function for linear polymers. Our ideas are easily generalized to crosslinked polymer blends which are treated within a modified version of Leibler's mean field theory for block copolymers."

        "Abstract": "We follow up an earlier work (briefly reviewed below) to investigate the temporal stability of an exact travelling front solution, constructed in the form of an integral expression, for a one-dimensional discrete Nagumo-like model without recovery. Since the model is a piecewise linear one with an on-site reaction function involving a Heaviside step function, a straightforward linearisation around the front solution presents problems, and we follow an alternative approach in estimating a `stability multiplier' by looking at the variational problem as a succession of linear evolution of the perturbations, punctuated with `kicks' of small but finite duration. The perturbations get damped during the linear evolution, while the kicks amplify only the perturbations located at specific sites (the `significant perturbations', see below) with reference to the propagating front. Comparison is made with results of numerical integration of the reaction-diffusion system whereby it appears likely that the travelling front is temporally stable for all parameter values characterising the model for which it exists. We modify the system by introducing a slow variation of a relevant recovery parameter and perform a leading order singular perturbation analysis to construct a pulse solution in the resulting model. In addition, we obtain (in the leading order) a 1-parameter family of periodic pulse trains for the system, modelling re-entrant pulses in a one-dimensional ring of excitable cells."

Take, for instance, flow models, which learn a latent space of invertible features that follow a simple distribution. Conversely, kernel density techniques use instances to shift a simple distribution into an aggregate mixture model. Here we propose multiple methods to enhance the latent space of a flow model with neighborhood information. Not only does our proposed framework represent a more human-like approach by leveraging both learned features and memories, but it may also be viewed as a step forward in non-parametric methods. The efficacy of our model is shown empirically with standard image datasets. We observe compelling results and a significant improvement over baselines."

This dark matter to baryon mass ratio is generally larger than the cosmological ratio of about five, since a significant part of baryon is diffused in the form of intergalactic medium. How to achieve such a low dark matter to baryon mass ratio is a challenge to the standard galaxy formation mechanism. Here we show that such a low ratio can be a natural consequence if the NGC 1052-DF2 had experienced a single passage within a few kpcs to the center of galaxy NGC 1052. The tidal effect of NGC 1052 in the encounter will heat the NGC 1052-DF2 up, stretch the previous dwarf galaxy significantly into its current size. The relative lacking of dark matter in the observed region is a natural consequence of the dark matter extended distribution and relatively less concentration in the corresponding central region before encounter, together with a systematic underestimation of the trace mass estimator method during relaxation after encounter. The observed flat distribution of the ultra-diffuse galaxy can be reproduced. Our results shows no need of introducing any new physical mechanism."

We prove that, when $K'$ runs through all finite tame extensions of $K$, suitable normalizations of the pushforwards of these measures to the Berkovich analytification of $X$ converge to a Lebesgue-type measure on the temperate part of the Kontsevich--Soibelman skeleton, assuming the existence of a strict normal crossings model for $X$. We also prove a similar result for all finite extensions $K'$ under the assumption that $X$ has a log smooth model. This is a non-archimedean counterpart of analogous results for volume forms on degenerating complex Calabi--Yau manifolds by Boucksom and the first-named author. Along the way, we develop a general theory of Lebesgue measures on Berkovich skeleta over discretely valued fields."

Earlier there was defined a notion of the universal Euler characteristic of an orbifold.

Extending the phase space results in the preservation under a small enough perturbation of cylinders of the extended autonomous system rather than the usual tori. To prove the theorem we transform the Hamiltonian $H$ to a normal form which depends on fewer angles, none if possible. This transformation is done via a near identity canonical transformation. The canonical transformation is constructed using the Lie series formalism and by solving for a generating function. Because of the aperiodic time dependence, the usual Fourier series methods used to obtain the generating function no longer apply. Instead, we use Fourier transform methods to solve for the generating function and make use of an isoenergetic non-degeneracy condition which results in a shift of frequencies associated with each cylinder."

The most important feature of this system is that the lensing magnification results in an apparent magnitude of r=20.3, making this one of the brightest LBGs known. Such a high magnification provides the opportunity of obtaining very high signal to noise (and potentially spatially resolved) spectroscopy of a high redshift galaxy to study its physical properties.

        "Title": "Central energy equipartition in multi-mass models of globular clusters",
        "Abstract": "In the construction of multi-mass King-Michie models of globular clusters, an approximated central energy equipartition between stars of different masses is usually imposed by scaling the velocity parameter of each mass class inversely with the stellar mass, as if the distribution function were isothermal. In this paper, this 'isothermal approximation' (IA) has been checked and its consequences on the model parameters studied by a comparison with models including central energy equipartition correctly. It is found that, under the IA, the 'temperatures' of a pair of components can differ to a non-negligible amount for low concentration distributions. It is also found that, in general, this approximation leads to a significantly reduced mass segregation in comparison with that given under the exact energy equipartition at the centre. As a representative example, an isotropic 3-component model fitting a given projected surface brightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles is discussed. In this example, the IA gives a cluster envelope much more concentrated (central dimensionless potential W=3.3) than under the true equipartition (W=0.059), as well as a higher logarithmic mass function slope. As a consequence, the inferred total mass (and then the global mass-to-light ratio) results a factor 1.4 times lower than the correct value and the amount of mass in heavy dark remnants is 3.3 times smaller. Under energy equipartition, the fate of stars having a mass below a certain limit is to escape from the system. This limit is derived as a function of the mass and W of the giants and turn-off stars component."

The spectral ranges analyzed are in the region of the stellar MgIb (5175 A), the near IR CaII triplet (8550 A) absorption features, and the region of the Halpha emission line. We have compared the shape of the stellar features with those of reference stars and determined the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) of the stellar component by using a two-dimensional Gaussian decomposition algorithm, and show for the first time the rotation curve of the stellar component in NGC 253. Comparing the recesion velocity curves of the gas and stars, it is seen that the stellar component has a decoupled kinematics respect to the gas, displaying a shollower velocity gradient and larger velocity dispersion that the gas in the inner regions. The minor axis kinematics together with the kinematics across the central 40$''$ along the major axis, suggest the presence of a rotating body with a kinematically misaligned axis respect to the main disk of the galaxy. The asymmetries in the LOSVD along the minor axis together with the steep velocity gradient of the gaseous component suggest a merger scenario to explain the these kinematically signatures. The enclosed mass in the central regions is computed to be (2.4+-0.5) 10^7$ Mo for a radius of r=0.7'' (10 pc). A double gaseous component in the central 6 arcsecs is detected from the [SIII] lambda 9069 A data along the minor axis; this seems to be the signature of a superbubble due to a supernova rate of 0.05 yr^{-1}."

        "Abstract": "The paper first discusses theoretically the off-resonance selective excitation method that is dependent on the atomic internal states and used to generate approximately a standard coherent state of harmonic oscillator. The coherent average method then is proposed to construct the state-selective trigger pulse. A state-selective trigger pulse can keep Gaussian shape unchanged but change in an internal-state-dependent form the center-of-mass position and/or momentum of an atomic Gaussian wave-packet motional state. A Gaussian wave-packet state is one of the simplest wave-packet states that can be easily manipulated and controlled in time and space. The paper also investigates how to manipulate in time and space an atomic Gaussian wave-packet motional state by a generalized quadratic potential field. A general quadratic Hamiltonian can affect not only the center-of-mass position and momentum but also the complex linewidth of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state while keep Gaussian shape of the motional state unchanged. It is shown that generally quadratic terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can control directly the complex linewidth, while linear terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can affect only the center-of-mass position and momentum of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state."

        "Abstract": "We present a deep X-ray observation of the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in NGC4258 (M106) using ASCA. The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona) must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux."

By analogy with active galactic nuclei models, it has been proposed that Sgr A* may be a massive accreting black holes. The black hole hypothesis is, however, problematic because no model of Sgr A* has been able to explain the observed spectrum in any self-consistent way, and there is no consensus on either the mass of the black hole or the mass accretion rate. Sgr A* has been observed in the radio, sub-mm, infrared, and X-ray bands, and the various various detections and flux upper limits cover more than ten decades of frequency, from $\\nu\\sles\\ 10^9$ Hz (meter wavelength radio bands) up to $\\nu\\ \\sgreat\\ 10^{19}$ Hz (150 keV X-rays). We present a robust model of Sgr A* in which a million solar mass black hole accretes at the rate of a few $\\times10^{-6}$ solar masses per year. This model fits the entire spectrum self-consistently. The unique feature of the model is that the flow is advection-dominated, i.e. most of the energy viscously dissipated in the differentially rotating flow is carried along with the gas and lost through the horizon. The apparent success of this model in explaining the data may be considered ``proof'' that horizons are real and that a massive black hole does exist at the Galactic center."

In both cases, the object is treated as a global entity, and a single pose estimate is computed. As a consequence, the resulting techniques can be vulnerable to large occlusions.   In this paper, we introduce a segmentation-driven 6D pose estimation framework where each visible part of the objects contributes a local pose prediction in the form of 2D keypoint locations. We then use a predicted measure of confidence to combine these pose candidates into a robust set of 3D-to-2D correspondences, from which a reliable pose estimate can be obtained. We outperform the state-of-the-art on the challenging Occluded-LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets, which is evidence that our approach deals well with multiple poorly-textured objects occluding each other. Furthermore, it relies on a simple enough architecture to achieve real-time performance."

The system comprises two high-surface brightness arcs with a maximum extent of 3\", bracketing a central object which we identify as a massive early-type galaxy at z=0.73. We construct a lens model which reproduces the main features of the system using a combination of a galaxy-scale lens and the foreground cluster. We show that the morphological, spectral and photometric properties of the arcs are consistent with them arising from the lensing of a single ~L* LBG. The most important feature of this system is that the lensing magnification results in an apparent magnitude of r=20.3, making this one of the brightest LBGs known. Such a high magnification provides the opportunity of obtaining very high signal to noise (and potentially spatially resolved) spectroscopy of a high redshift galaxy to study its physical properties. We present initial imaging and spectroscopy demonstrating the basic properties of the system and discuss the opportunities for future observations."

The model couples a Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman (CHB) system with a elliptic reaction-diffusion equation for a nutrient. The fluid velocity, governed by the Brinkman law, is not solenodial, as its divergence is a function of the nutrient and the phase field variable, i.e., solution-dependent, and frictionless boundary conditions are prescribed for the velocity to avoid imposing unrealistic constraints on the divergence relation. In this paper we give a first result on the existence of weak and stationary solutions to the CHB model with singular potentials, specifically the double obstacle potential and the logarithmic potential, which ensures the phase field variable stay in the physically relevant interval. New difficulties arise from the interplay between the singular potentials and the solution-dependent source terms, but can be overcome with several key estimates for the approximations of the singular potentials, which may be of independent interests. As a consequence, included in our analysis is a weak existence result for a Darcy variant, and our work serve to generalise recent results on weak and stationary solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard inpainting model with singular potentials."

Furthermore, we show that the number of disjunctions or the arity of dependence atoms (dep-arity) as a parameter both yield a paraNP-completeness result. Then, we consider the satisfiability problem (SAT) showing a different picture: under team-size, or dep-arity SAT is paraNP-complete whereas under all other mentioned parameters the problem is in FPT. Finally, we introduce a variant of the satisfiability problem, asking for teams of a given size, and show for this problem an almost complete picture."

        "Abstract": "Parking pressure has been steadily increasing in cities as well as in university and corporate campuses. To relieve this pressure, this paper studies a car-pooling platform that would match riders and drivers, while guaranteeing a ride back and exploiting spatial and temporal locality. In particular, the paper formalizes the Commute Trip Sharing Problem (CTSP) to find a routing plan that maximizes ride sharing for a set of commute trips. The CTSP is a generalization of the vehicle routing problem with routes that satisfy time window, capacity, pairing, precedence, ride duration, and driver constraints. The paper introduces two exact algorithms for the CTPS: A route-enumeration algorithm and a branch-and-price algorithm. Experimental results show that, on a high-fidelity, real-world dataset of commute trips from a mid-size city, both algorithms optimally solve small and medium-sized problems and produce high-quality solutions for larger problem instances. The results show that car pooling, if widely adopted, has the potential to reduce vehicle usage by up to 57% and decrease vehicle miles traveled by up to 46% while only incurring a 22% increase in average ride time per commuter for the trips considered."

This allows the lender to find a default threshold at which the financial loss of a loan portfolio is minimised, in accordance with Basel II. Alternative delinquency measures, other than simply measuring payments in arrears, can also be evaluated using this optimisation procedure. Furthermore, a simulation study is performed in testing the procedure from `first principles' across a wide range of credit risk scenarios. Specifically, three probabilistic techniques are used to generate cash flows, while the parameters of each are varied, as part of the simulation study. The results show that loss minima can exist for a select range of credit risk profiles, which suggests that the loss optimisation of default thresholds can become a viable practice. The default decision is therefore framed anew as an optimisation problem in choosing a default threshold that is neither too early nor too late in loan life. These results also challenges current practices wherein default is pragmatically defined as `90 days past due', with little objective evidence for its overall suitability or financial impact, at least beyond flawed roll rate analyses or a regulator's decree."

However, a fast convergence to the optimal solution can only be ensured with the use of problem-specific sampling distributions. Due to the large variety of driving situations within the context of automated driving, it is very challenging to manually design such distributions. This paper introduces therefore a data-driven approach utilizing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN): Given the current driving situation, future ego-vehicle poses can be directly generated from the output of the CNN allowing to guide the motion planner efficiently towards the optimal solution. A benchmark highlights that the CNN predicts future vehicle poses with a higher accuracy compared to uniform sampling and a state-of-the-art A*-based approach. Combining this CNN-guided sampling with the motion planner Bidirectional RRT* reduces the computation time by up to an order of magnitude and yields a faster convergence to a lower cost as well as a success rate of 100 % in the tested scenarios."

In the case of magnetic external forces acting on an ultrarelativistic beam, the longitudinal self-interactions are responsible for CSR (Coherent Synchrotron Radiation)-related phenomena, which have been studied extensively. On the other hand, transverse self-interactions are present too. At the time being, existing theoretical analysis of transverse self-forces deal with the case of a bunch moving along a circular orbit only, without considering the situation of a bending magnet with a finite length. In this paper we propose an electrodynamical analysis of transverse self-fields which originate, at the position of a test particle, from an ultrarelativistic electron bunch moving in an arc of a circle. The problem will be first addressed within a two-particle system. We then extend our consideration to a line bunch with a stepped density distribution, a situation which can be easily generalized to the case of an arbitrary density distribution. Our approach turns out to be also useful in order to get a better insight in the physics involved in the case of simple circular motion and in order to address the well known issue of the partial compensation of transverse self-force."

A prime motivation of this development is the description of a carbon detonation in conditions relevant to superbursts, which are thought to result from the propagation of a detonation front around the surface of a neutron star in the carbon layer underlying the atmosphere. Methods. The algorithm we have developed is a finite-volume method inspired by the original MUSCL scheme of van Leer (1979). The algorithm is of second-order in the smooth part of the flow and avoids dimensional splitting. It is applied to some test cases, and the time-dependent results are compared to the corresponding steady state solution. Results. Our algorithm proves to be robust to test cases, and is considered to be reliably applicable to astrophysical detonations. The preliminary one-dimensional calculations we have performed demonstrate that the carbon detonation at the surface of a neutron star is a multiscale phenomenon. The length scale of liberation of energy is $10^6$ times smaller than the total reaction length. We show that a multi-resolution approach can be used to solve all the reaction lengths. This result will be very useful in future multi-dimensional simulations. We present also thermodynamical and composition profiles after the passage of a detonation in a pure carbon or mixed carbon-iron layer, in thermodynamical conditions relevant to superbursts in pure helium accretor systems."

The K0-giant BD +48 738 is orbited by a > 0.91 MJ planet which has a period of 393 days and shows a non-linear, long-term radial velocity trend that indicates a presence of another, more distant companion, which may have a substellar mass or be a low-mass star. The K2-giant HD 96127, has a > 4.0 MJ mass companion in a 647-day orbit around the star. The two K2-giants exhibit a significant RV noise that complicates the detection of low-amplitude, periodic variations in the data. If the noise component of the observed RV variations is due to solar-type oscillations, we show, using all the published data for the substellar companions to giants, that its amplitude is anti-correlated with stellar metallicity."

        "Title": "Gradients of Generative Models for Improved Discriminative Analysis of  Tandem Mass Spectra",
        "Abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a high-throughput technology used toidentify the proteins in a complex biological sample, such as a drop of blood. A collection of spectra is generated at the output of the process, each spectrum of which is representative of a peptide (protein subsequence) present in the original complex sample. In this work, we leverage the log-likelihood gradients of generative models to improve the identification of such spectra. In particular, we show that the gradient of a recently proposed dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) may be naturally employed by a kernel-based discriminative classifier. The resulting Fisher kernel substantially improves upon recent attempts to combine generative and discriminative models for post-processing analysis, outperforming all other methods on the evaluated datasets. We extend the improved accuracy offered by the Fisher kernel framework to other search algorithms by introducing Theseus, a DBN representing a large number of widely used MS/MS scoring functions. Furthermore, with gradient ascent and max-product inference at hand, we use Theseus to learn model parameters without any supervision."

        "Abstract": "The $^{32}$Cl(p,$\\gamma$)$^{33}$Ar reaction rate is of potential importance in the rp-process powering type I X-ray bursts. Recently Clement et al. \\cite{CBB04} presented new data on excitation energies for low lying proton unbound states in $^{33}$Ar obtained with a new method developed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. We use their data, together with a direct capture model and a USD shell model calculation to derive a new reaction rate for use in astrophysical model calculations. In particular, we take into account capture on the first excited state in $^{32}$Cl, and also present a realistic estimate of the remaining uncertainties. We find that the $^{32}$Cl(p,$\\gamma$)$^{33}$Ar reaction rate is dominated entirely by capture on the first excited state in $^{32}$Cl over the whole temperature range relevant in X-ray bursts. In the temperature range from 0.2 to 1 GK the rate is up to a factor of 70 larger than the previously recommended rate based on shell model calculations only. The uncertainty is now reduced from up to a factor of 1000 to a factor of 3 at 0.3-0.7 GK and a factor of 6 at 1.5 GK."

        "Abstract": "The properties of a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) superconductor with {\\it an open Fermi surface} are expected to be unusual in a magnetic field. On the one hand, the quasi-1D structure of the Fermi surface strongly favors the formation of a non-uniform state (Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state) in the presence of a magnetic field acting on the electron spins. On the other hand, a magnetic field acting on an open Fermi surface induces a dimensional crossover by confining the electronic wave-functions wave-functions along the chains of highest conductivity, which results in a divergence of the orbital critical field and in a stabilization at low temperature of a cascade of superconducting phases separated by first order transistions. In this paper, we study the phase diagram as a function of the anisotropy. We discuss in details the experimental situation in the quasi-1D organic conductors of the Bechgaard salts family and argue that they appear as good candidates for the observation of the LOFF state, provided that their anisotropy is large enough. Recent experiments on the organic quasi-1D superconductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ are in agreement with the results obtained in this paper and could be interpreted as a signature of a high-field superconducting phase. We also point out the possibility to observe a LOFF state in some quasi-2D organic superconductors."

        "Title": "Noisy Beeping Networks",
        "Abstract": "We introduce noisy beeping networks, where nodes have limited communication capabilities, namely, they can only emit energy or sense the channel for energy. Furthermore, imperfections may cause devices to malfunction with some fixed probability when sensing the channel, which amounts to deducing a noisy received transmission. Such noisy networks have implications for ultra-lightweight sensor networks and biological systems.   We show how to compute tasks in a noise-resilient manner over noisy beeping networks of arbitrary structure. In particular, we transform any algorithm that assumes a noiseless beeping network (of size $n$) into a noise-resilient version while incurring a multiplicative overhead of only $O(\\log n)$ in its round complexity, with high probability. We show that our coding is optimal for some tasks, such as node-coloring of a clique.   We further show how to simulate a large family of algorithms designed for distributed networks in the CONGEST($B$) model over a noisy beeping network. The simulation succeeds with high probability and incurs an asymptotic multiplicative overhead of $O(B\\cdot \\Delta \\cdot \\min(n,\\Delta^2))$ in the round complexity, where $\\Delta$ is the maximal degree of the network. The overhead is tight for certain graphs, e.g., a clique. Further, this simulation implies a constant overhead coding for constant-degree networks."

        "Title": "Doublet Groups, Extended Lie Algebras, and Well Defined Gauge Theories  for the Two Form Field",
        "Abstract": "We propose a symmetry law for a doublet of different form fields, which resembles gauge transformations for matter fields. This may be done for general Lie groups, resulting in an extension of Lie algebras and group manifolds. It is also shown that non-associative algebras naturally appear in this formalism, which are briefly discussed.   Afterwards, a general connection which includes a two-form field is settled-down, solving the problem of setting a gauge theory for the Kalb-Ramond field for generical groups.   Topological Chern-Simons theories can also be defined in four dimensions, and this approach clarifies their relation to the so-called $B \\wedge F$-theories. We also revise some standard aspects of Kalb-Ramond theories in view of these new perspectives.   Since this gauge connection is built upon a pair of fields consisting of a one-form and a two-form, one may define Yang-Mills theories as usually and, remarkably, also {\\it minimal coupling} with bosonic matter, where the Kalb-Ramond field appears naturally as mediator; so, a new associated conserved charge can be defined. For the Abelian case, we explicitly construct the minimal interaction between $B$-field and matter following a \"gauge principle\" and find a novel conserved tensor current. This is our most significative result from the physical viewpoint.   This framework is also generalized in such a way that any $p$-rank tensor may be formulated as a gauge field."

        "Abstract": "Time crystals are quantum systems which are able to reveal condensed matter behavior in the time domain. It is known that crystalization in time can be observed in a periodically driven many-body system when interactions between particles force a system to evolve with a period which is an integer multiple of a driving period. This phenomenon is dubbed discrete time crystal formation. Here, we consider ultra-cold atoms bouncing on an oscillating atom mirror and show that the system can spontaneously form a discrete time crystal where the ratio of a period of its motion and a driving period is a rational number. This kind of discrete time crystals requires higher order resonant driving which is analyzed here with the help of an original approach."

        "Abstract": "This paper is a sequel to our earlier work [BFPRW], where we study the derived representation scheme DRep_{g}(A) parametrizing the representations of a Lie algebra A in a finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebra g. In [BFPRW], we defined two canonical maps Tr_{g}(A): HC^{(r)}(A) \\to \\H[\\DRep_{g}(A)]^G and \\Phi_{g}(A): H[\\DRep_{g}(A)]^G \\to H[\\DRep_{h}(A)]^W called the Drinfeld trace and the derived Harish-Chandra homomorphism, respectively. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the Drinfeld trace in terms of Chern-Simons classes of a canonical g-torsor associated to the pair (A, g). Our construction is inspired by (and, in a sense, dual to) the classical construction of `additive regulator maps' due to Beilinson and Feigin. As a consequence, we show that, if A is an abelian Lie algebra, the composite map Phi_{g}(A) Tr_{g}(A) is represented by a canonical differential operator acting on differential forms on Sym(A) and depending only on the Cartan data (h, W, P), where P is a W-invariant polynomial on h. We derive a combinatorial formula for this operator that plays an important role in the study of derived commuting schemes in [BFPRW]."

        "Title": "Kohn's theorem in a superfluid Fermi gas with a Feshbach resonance",
        "Abstract": "We investigate the dipole mode in a superfluid gas of Fermi atoms trapped in a harmonic potential. According to Kohn's theorem, the frequency of this collective mode is not affected by an interaction between the atoms and is always equal to the trap frequency. This remarkable property, however, does not necessarily hold in an approximate theory. We explicitly prove that the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA), including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels, is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory developed by Nozi\\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\\it depend} on the strength of effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance."

        "Title": "Distributed Selfish Load Balancing",
        "Abstract": "Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible amongst a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a ``selfish agent'', and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents to select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced.   Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m\\gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\\log\\log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\\log\\log m+n^4)$. We also give a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\max\\{\\log\\log m,n\\})$ for the convergence time."

        "Title": "Young stars in an old bulge: a natural outcome of internal evolution in  the Milky Way",
        "Abstract": "The center of our disk galaxy, the Milky Way, is dominated by a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. Numerous studies of the bulge based on stellar photometry have concluded that the bulge stars are exclusively old. The perceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its likely formation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a unique population that formed early and separately from the disk. However, recent studies of individual bulge stars using the microlensing technique have reported that they span a range of ages, emphasizing that the bulge may not be a monolithic structure. In this letter we demonstrate that the presence of young stars that are located predominantly near the plane is expected for a bulge that has formed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. Using an N-body+SPH simulation of a disk galaxy forming out of gas cooling inside a dark matter halo and forming stars, we find a qualitative agreement between our model and the observations of young metal-rich stars in the bulge. We are also able to partially resolve the apparent contradiction in the literature between results that argue for a purely old bulge population and those which show a population comprised of a range in ages; the key is where to look."

        "Title": "Quantization of (2+1)-spinning particles and bifermionic constraint  problem",
        "Abstract": "This work is a natural continuation of our recent study in quantizing relativistic particles. There it was demonstrated that, by applying a consistent quantization scheme to a classical model of a spinless relativistic particle as well as to the Berezin-Marinov model of 3+1 Dirac particle, it is possible to obtain a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics of such particles. In the present article we apply a similar approach to the problem of quantizing the massive 2+1 Dirac particle. However, we stress that such a problem differs in a nontrivial way from the one in 3+1 dimensions. The point is that in 2+1 dimensions each spin polarization describes different fermion species. Technically this fact manifests itself through the presence of a bifermionic constant and of a bifermionic first-class constraint. In particular, this constraint does not admit a conjugate gauge condition at the classical level. The quantization problem in 2+1 dimensions is also interesting from the physical viewpoint (e.g. anyons). In order to quantize the model, we first derive a classical formulation in an effective phase space, restricted by constraints and gauges. Then the condition of preservation of the classical symmetries allows us to realize the operator algebra in an unambiguous way and construct an appropriate Hilbert space. The physical sector of the constructed quantum mechanics contains spin-1/2 particles and antiparticles without an infinite number of negative-energy levels, and exactly reproduces the one-particle sector of the 2+1 quantum theory of a spinor field."

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present the strategy of Agent Madoff, which is a heuristic-based negotiation agent that won 2nd place at the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC 2017). Agent Madoff is implemented to play the game Diplomacy, which is a strategic board game that mimics the situation during World War I. Each player represents a major European power which has to negotiate with other forces and win possession of a majority supply centers on the map. We propose a design architecture which consists of 3 components: heuristic module, acceptance strategy and bidding strategy. The heuristic module, responsible for evaluating which regions on the graph are more worthy, considers the type of region and the number of supply centers adjacent to the region and return a utility value for each region on the map. The acceptance strategy is done on a case-by-case basis according to the type of the order by calculating the acceptance probability using a composite function. The bidding strategy adopts a defensive approach aimed to neutralize attacks and resolve conflict moves with other players to minimize our loss on supply centers."
