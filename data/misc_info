Find a way to trim the abstracts to a base set of words while keeping in numbers which
describe the amount of data while removing numbers which show a citation or footnote.

Can you truely see whether a dataset is created in the abstract? Could they instead
mention another dataset or talk about them in another section further on in the paper?

Once a new dataset is confirmed, how to get more information about it?
